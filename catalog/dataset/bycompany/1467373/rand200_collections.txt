1467373_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:
1467373_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	We provide value to our clients based in part on a differentiated range of proprietary inventions, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital, and other intellectual property.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	We recognize the increasing value of intellectual property in the marketplace and create, harvest, and protect this intellectual property.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P72_S3	We leverage patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P72_S4	We have also established policies to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties, such as Accenture s clients, partners, and others.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	As of August 31, 2011, we had 2,718 patent applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions and had been issued 600 U.S. patents and 524 non-U.S. patents.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Trademarks appearing in this report are the trademarks or registered trademarks of Accenture Global Services Ltd or third parties, as applicable.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	On September 1, 2009, Accenture Ltd completed a transaction in which Accenture plc, organized in Ireland, became the parent holding company of Accenture.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	This transaction is described below under History.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than Class I common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares ( Accenture SCA ).
1467373_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	Accenture plc s only business is to hold these shares.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	As the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plc s majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P77_S3	Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P77_S4	Accenture plc was elected the general partner of Accenture SCA in place of Accenture Ltd at the November 16, 2009 shareholder meeting of Accenture SCA.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Accenture SCA Class I common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	In fiscal 2005, we replaced the internal use of the partner title with the more comprehensive senior executive title and applied the senior executive title to our highest-level employees, including those previously referred to as partners.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	However, for proper context, we continue to use the term partner in certain situations and particularly when discussing our reorganization and the period prior to our incorporation.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction ).
1467373_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	On August 5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	The Transaction was subsequently completed on September 1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	In the Transaction, all of the outstanding Class A and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued Class A and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd Class A and Class X common shares, as applicable (and cash for any fractional shares).
1467373_11_ITEM1_P81_S4	Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Class A ordinary shares of the Irish company, Accenture plc, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 1, 2009 under the symbol ACN, the same symbol under which Class A common shares of Accenture Ltd, its predecessor, were previously listed.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report with respect to periods prior to September 1, 2009 reflect the consolidated operations of Accenture Ltd (the predecessor registrant of Accenture plc) and its subsidiaries.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P82_S2	The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report reflect the ownership interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain of our current and former senior executives as noncontrolling interests.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P82_S3	The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 9% as of August 31, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	As described above under History, Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture SCA Class I common shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S3	A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S4	Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S5	Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares Only Accenture and our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA Class I common shares.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S6	Each Class I common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P85_S7	As of October 11, 2011, Accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 91% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 9% of the voting interest held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCA s articles of association.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Under Accenture SCA s articles of association, the market value of a Class I common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i) the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the Class A ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii) if Accenture plc sells its Class A ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the Class A ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P86_S3	In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P86_S4	Except in the case of a redemption of Class I common shares or a transfer of Class I common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCA s articles of association provide that Accenture SCA Class I common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P86_S5	In addition, all holders of Class I common shares (except Accenture) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture SCA or transferred to Accenture SCA, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA Class I common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture SCA Class I common shares in the tender offer).
1467373_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P87_S2	Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.
1467373_11_ITEM1_P87_S3	The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture SCA.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Global economic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve, and volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets could undermine business confidence, both in those markets and other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives or terminate existing contracts, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate, for an extended period of time.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may affect demand for our services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S8	A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in Europe and North America.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S9	Weakening in these markets as a result of high government deficits, credit downgrades or otherwise, could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S11	This could result, for example, in us not having the level of appropriate personnel where they are needed, and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S12	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P0_S13	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions could negatively affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	and solutions to meet that demand.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If a client is dissatisfied with our services and we are unable to effectively respond to its needs, the client might terminate existing contracts, or reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S8	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S9	For example, in fiscal 2009, we experienced a higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings as a result of challenging economic conditions and clients being acquired, which negatively affected our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S10	It could also result in pressure to reduce the cost of our services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S11	For example, during fiscal years 2009 and 2010, challenging economic conditions led to our moving work more quickly into our Global Delivery Network than planned in order to respond to client demand to reduce costs, which resulted in our revenues being less than anticipated.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S12	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S13	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S14	Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S15	We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology and industry developments and grow and manage our business.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S16	For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S17	As we expand our services and solutions, we also hire and must retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than the majority of our personnel.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S18	If we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries may suffer.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S19	We are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S20	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S21	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P3_S22	Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate delivery skills.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If we are unable to effectively mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The mobility of our employees also contributes to the effective operation of our global business model.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which it can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, could make it more difficult to deploy our employees on client engagements and could increase costs.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	There is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Additionally, if demand were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The consulting and outsourcing markets are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets, and that may make our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint, or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	For example, there has been a continuing trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider, more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can, and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S7	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S8	We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S9	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S10	The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including an attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	India and the Philippines have experienced natural disasters and are subject to pandemics, severe weather conditions, including earthquakes, volcanoes, cyclones, typhoons, floods and other storms, which may occur again and could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Additionally, both countries have experienced political instability and worker strikes.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S4	India in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including Pakistan.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities, natural disasters and other conditions, which are described more fully below, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P14_S7	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally, and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	There can be no assurance that our contractual provisions will offset their impact, or that our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, will be successful.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact our underlying exposures, perhaps eliminating them.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place, not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets, which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Acts of terrorist violence, political unrest, armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters, like the earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan in March 2011, global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S6	These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S7	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S9	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S10	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S11	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S12	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S13	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and labor relations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S14	This includes in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S15	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S16	Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P19_S17	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	For example, because outsourcing and systems integration represent a significant portion of our business, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our government work, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated, or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S6	If we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services to enable us to meet our profitability, our revenues and profitability expectations could materially suffer.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P21_S7	The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, all of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Increased competition from companies located in lower-cost locations has reduced the prices we can charge for some of our services, particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon which we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	limited data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned, or be unprofitable.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our pricing, cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting work and frequently on our outsourcing work, include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale projects or enterprises.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, the government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and at their convenience.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls, uncertainties or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the U.S. and certain countries in Europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If these audits conclude that the costs are not reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for them, or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Findings from an audit also could result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for our work, may affect our future profitability or may prevent us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	percentage of our costs, and we may be subject to such requirement with respect to current open audits or future audits.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards, and conduct system reviews, investigations and other inquiries of our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, if the government auditors find, and the Defense Contract Management Agency (which has administrative authority over our U.S. government contracts) concludes, that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs or may have to refund money that has already been paid to us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Because we are incorporated in Ireland, our U.S. federal practice operates under a separate agreement with the U.S. federal government in order to perform classified work for the U.S. government.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may be required by the government to amend the agreement from time to time, and we are currently in discussions with the U.S. government regarding proposed amendments.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Depending on the outcome of those discussions, we might be required to adjust our current operations and/or incur additional costs in order to continue to perform certain services for the U.S. government, and we cannot predict at this time the total costs or whether the changes will adversely affect us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Government contracts, and the proceedings surrounding them, are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Negative publicity related to our government contracts, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate than those for commercial contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	For example, government contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches, less favorable payment terms, and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Legislative proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect Accenture.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If any of the risks discussed above were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or otherwise breach obligations, to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S5	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S6	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S7	If we cannot or do not perform our obligations, we could face significant legal liability, and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability, because a third party may allege fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S8	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S9	If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide such solutions and services, and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, or if liability limitations are not enforced, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P41_S10	In addition to expense, litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, and litigation results can be unpredictable.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities, and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and amount of our recovery.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond our core business that will enable us to differentiate our services and solutions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Outsourcing services subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Outsourcing services, which represented approximately 41% of our net revenues in fiscal 2011, present different operational risks, when compared to our consulting and systems integration services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In fiscal 2011, we expanded our outsourcing services and solutions into new areas, such as care management and mortgage processing, and we expect to continue to do so.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Expanding into new areas may expose us to additional regulatory or other risks specific to such new areas.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P45_S4	We may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P45_S5	If a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements, there is a risk that we could face legal liability.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	No. 70 (SAS 70) of the control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them (effective June 15, 2011, SAS 70 was retired and replaced with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 and International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402).
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If we receive a qualified opinion, or do not deliver the audit reports timely, our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	These claims could harm our reputation, cost us money or prevent us from offering some services or solutions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, injure our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients, an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	We could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Third-party suppliers of software, hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued, and this could disrupt use of their products or services by Accenture and our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	If our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S8	We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S9	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S11	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P49_S12	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Depending on the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In certain situations, we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S5	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, or other delivery failures.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors and alliance partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community and the media.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S7	There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers which are our alliance partners.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliances partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We may not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating other businesses.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S5	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S7	We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S8	We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S9	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S10	Ongoing business may be disrupted and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S11	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S12	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S13	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S14	We might not achieve our expected return on investment, or may lose money.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S15	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from an acquired company, including from terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S16	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S17	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S18	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S19	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P53_S20	We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, ongoing global consolidation of our office space and re-alignment of portions of our non-client-facing workforce to lower-cost locations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Over time, we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs, we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management, to the same degree as in the past.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by moving more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Many of our contracts include performance payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Many of our contracts include performance clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service levels.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P56_S3	We also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P56_S4	These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P56_S5	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Changes in our level of taxes, and audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions with respect to the judgments we make.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P58_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	For example, Ireland faces continuing economic uncertainty, including in connection with its outstanding debt obligations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	These uncertainties have led to discussion regarding a potential increase to the corporate tax rate.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Increases in the tax rate in Ireland or any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the U.S. and Ireland, there can be no assurance that legislative or diplomatic action will not be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with the United States.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As of August 31, 2011, we had approximately 236,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S3	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S4	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Finally, the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S6	For example, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S7	If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S8	If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S9	Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S10	We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S11	In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S12	We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S13	Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S14	There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S15	Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S16	Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S17	If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S18	In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S19	Our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P61_S20	Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to our overall revenue growth and revenue growth for our priority emerging markets and earnings per share growth.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	As a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P66_S4	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P67_S4	We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P67_S5	The laws of Ireland do however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the United States judgment.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Some companies that conduct business in the United States but are domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company, and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our current incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2009 of Ireland (the Companies Acts ).
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.

1467373_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all of our office space is leased under long-term leases with varying expiration dates.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	We are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P1_S4	We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P1_S5	We do not expect that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	As previously reported, in April 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice intervened in a civil qui tam action previously filed under seal by two private individuals ( relators ) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas against Accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	amended alleged that, in connection with work we undertook for the U.S. federal government, we received payments, resale revenue or other benefits as a result of, or otherwise acted improperly in connection with, alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of contracts with the U.S. government and/or applicable law or regulations.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	Similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P3_S2	On September 9, 2011, we entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P3_S3	Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to pay the United States $63.675 million, in consideration for the release of all claims alleged by the government and the relators against us in the matter, and we expressly denied any wrongdoing.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P3_S4	The relators will petition the court for attorneys fees and costs associated with the matter, and we expect to have to litigate the basis for and amounts of those fees and costs.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability.
1467373_11_ITEM2_P4_S1	We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

1467373_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	On September 26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 2011.

1467373_11_ITEM5_P4_S2	Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P4_S3	Future dividends on Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Accenture plc and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors of Accenture plc may deem relevant, as well as our ability to pay dividends in compliance with the Companies Acts.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P4_S4	In certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to our shareholders.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P4_S5	Shareholders resident in relevant territories (including countries that are European Union member states (other than Ireland), the United States and other countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty) may be exempted from Irish dividend withholding tax.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P4_S6	However, shareholders residing in other countries will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.

1467373_11_ITEM5_P11_S2	These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P12_S0	Purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P12_S1	We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P12_S2	Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share.
1467373_11_ITEM5_P13_S0	(1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we acquired a total of 861,609 Accenture SCA Class I common shares and 105,400 Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares from current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.

We use the terms Accenture, we, the Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	For example, a reference to fiscal 2011 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Our results of operations can be affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $6.69 billion, compared with $5.42 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	Net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $25.51 billion, compared with $21.55 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	This very strong growth during fiscal 2011 contrasts with a 2% local currency revenue decline during fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S5	All of our operating groups experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, with very strong growth in Resources and Products.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S6	Based on new contract bookings over the last several quarters, we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P3_S7	We also expect the level of year-over-year growth will moderate, particularly in consulting, and vary across operating groups and geographic regions.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	There continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world, as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Such volatility and uncertainty, should it continue, could adversely affect our clients and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	We continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $3.88 billion, compared with $3.09 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 25% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	Consulting net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $14.92 billion, compared with $12.37 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	All five operating groups experienced year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, driven by very strong growth in Resources and Products.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P4_S6	In our consulting business overall, clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Compared to fiscal 2010, we are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network and we expect this trend to continue in the medium term.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	While the business environment remains competitive, pricing is stable with some improvement in certain areas of our business.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $2.81 billion, compared with $2.33 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $10.58 billion, compared with $9.18 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	All five operating groups experienced year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, led by Communications High Tech and Financial Services.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	Clients continue to be focused on projects that will improve operational effectiveness.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S5	Growth in outsourcing is driven by higher volumes, scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients, as well as services for new clients.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S6	As with systems integration consulting, compared to fiscal 2010 we are providing a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S7	As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S8	If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S9	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S10	When compared to fiscal 2010, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies during fiscal 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P6_S11	This resulted in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue results that were approximately 9% and 3% better than our results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011, respectively.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was approximately 85% and within our target range.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S6	We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S7	We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S8	Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 236,000 as of August 31, 2011, compared with approximately 223,000 as of May 31, 2011 and 204,000 as of August 31, 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P7_S9	This 16% year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 14%, compared with 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We adjust levels of new hiring, evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2012 became effective September 1, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand, mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis, manage attrition, recover increases in compensation and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 33.1%, compared with 34.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Gross margin for fiscal 2011 was 32.9%, compared with 33.6% for fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than fiscal 2010, as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	Gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared with 20.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P10_S5	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for fiscal 2011, compared with 20.1% for fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, investment in offerings, and marketing- and advertising-related activities.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate, to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	These actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lower-cost locations.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	For fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 0.2%, while general and administrative costs decreased 0.6% as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	The decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues, as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve, partially offset by a provision for litigation matters.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S6	While we continue to manage these costs, we expect the reduction in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues to moderate in fiscal 2012.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P11_S7	Our margins could be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $923 million, compared with $714 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $3,470 million, compared with $2,915 million for fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 13.8%, compared with 13.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	Operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 13.6%, compared with 13.5% for fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S5	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S6	Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S7	We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P12_S8	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $8.44 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.16 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.28 billion.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	New contract bookings for fiscal 2011 were $28.83 billion, with consulting bookings of $15.41 billion and outsourcing bookings of $13.42 billion.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Clients continue to seek flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting consulting work, which is resulting in smaller initial total contract values than in the past.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting generally span one to two years.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ).
1467373_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB 101, as amended by SAB 104.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P49_S3	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P49_S4	However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P49_S5	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P49_S6	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications High Tech, Financial Services, Health Public Service, Products and Resources.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P51_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	(1) May not total due to rounding.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	(2) EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Africa.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues within fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1467373_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Communications High Tech net revenues increased 14% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, with the exception of Electronics High Tech in Asia Pacific.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, with the exception of Electronics High Tech in EMEA.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Financial Services net revenues increased 18% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Consulting revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in Banking and Insurance in EMEA and all industry groups in Americas, partially offset by a decline in Banking in Asia Pacific.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Americas and EMEA.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Health Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Consulting revenues reflected growth in Americas and Asia Pacific, with significant growth in Health, partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The increase in consulting revenues was significantly impacted by a delivery inefficiency on a consulting contract in Public Service in Americas in fiscal 2010, which negatively affected revenues in that period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Outsourcing revenues increased due to growth in Americas, partially offset by a decrease in Public Service in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P58_S4	Outsourcing revenues also reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	In addition, the uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom and several other countries, continue to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	This had a negative impact on our revenues and new contract bookings in our public service business during fiscal 2011, and we expect this trend to continue.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Products net revenues increased 16% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Consumer Goods Services and Automotive.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth across all geographic regions and most industry groups, led by Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific and Air, Freight Travel Services in Americas and EMEA.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Resources net revenues increased 21% in local currency.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Consulting revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Natural Resources and Energy.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth in Energy and Natural Resources in Americas and Utilities and Energy in EMEA.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	Lower client demand for outsourcing services resulted in moderation of outsourcing revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and a shift in the mix of work towards consulting.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	This trend is expected to continue for the near term.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Americas net revenues increased 17% in local currency, led by the United States, Brazil and Canada.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	EMEA net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth in local currency in most countries, led by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa and Switzerland.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Asia Pacific net revenues increased 23% in local currency, led by Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and India.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2011 were $23,882 million, an increase of $3,703 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.3% from 87.4% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2011 were $22,037 million, an increase of $3,401 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.4% from 86.5% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2011 was $18,966 million, an increase of $3,123 million, or 20%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.3% from 68.6% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2011 was $17,120 million, an increase of $2,820 million, or 20%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.1% from 66.4% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S5	Gross margin for fiscal 2011 decreased to 32.9% from 33.6% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S6	Our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than the same period in fiscal 2010, as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S7	Gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S8	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011 was $3,094 million, an increase of $436 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.1% from 12.3% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S9	General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2011 were $1,820 million, an increase of $152 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.1% from 7.7% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P64_S10	The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues, as well as a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services due to better than expected bad debt experience, partially offset by a provision for litigation matters of $75 million.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $3,470 million, an increase of $556 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.6% from 13.5% during this period.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	(1) May not total due to rounding.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2011 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenues.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	During fiscal 2011, each operating group benefited from our management of general and administrative costs at a growth rate lower than that of our net revenues, as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, in fiscal 2011 each operating group experienced higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand and recorded a portion of the provision for litigation matters.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010, exclusive of these impacts.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Communications High Tech operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Financial Services operating income increased, primarily due to very strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Health Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth, including revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	Fiscal 2010 operating income included the negative impact of inefficient delivery on a few consulting contracts in Public Service.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Products operating income increased, primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	Products operating results in both periods were also impacted by expected lower margins on certain contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Resources operating income increased, primarily driven by significant consulting revenue growth.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	Interest Income Interest income for fiscal 2011 was $41 million, an increase of $11 million, or 37%, over fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and cash balances.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net for fiscal 2011 was $17 million, an increase of $32 million over fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The change was driven by net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2011, compared with net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 27.3%, compared with 29.3% for fiscal 2010.

1467373_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Investing activities: The $430 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment.

1467373_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2011, we issued 6,837,070 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement ).
1467373_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P121_S4	Subsequent Developments On September 26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P121_S5	Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 11, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P121_S6	Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P121_S7	On September 26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority bringing Accenture s total outstanding authority to approximately $6.0 billion.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2011, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
1467373_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	(1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	As of August 31, 2011, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $307 million, of which $295 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P124_S3	Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P124_S4	Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P124_S5	For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	(3) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	(4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	(5) May not total due to rounding.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S3	Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S4	Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S5	The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S6	For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S7	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P128_S8	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	The guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance; requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price; and requires a vendor to use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, respectively, do not exist as estimates of selling price.
1467373_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accenture s Global Delivery Network.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2011, it was anticipated that $9 million of the net gains, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12 months.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $358 million and $218 million as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2011 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page F-2.
1467373_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P9_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of August 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the three years ended August 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Accenture plc: We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S1	We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S2	Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P10_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P11_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P11_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P12_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P19_S3	Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P19_S4	The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P21_S2	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P22_S0	Reincorporation in Ireland On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of the Company s parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction ).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P22_S1	On August 5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, the Company s predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P22_S2	The Transaction was subsequently completed on September 1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became the Company s parent holding company.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P22_S3	Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 22, 2009.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P23_S0	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P23_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P24_S0	Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2011 presentation.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P24_S1	In addition, on September 1, 2009, the Company streamlined its approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P24_S2	This resulted in a greater amount of payroll costs for the Company s client-services personnel being recorded in Sales and marketing rather than Cost of services.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P24_S3	The Company has not reclassified fiscal 2009 amounts to conform to the fiscal 2011 and 2010 presentation, as it would be impractical to do so.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P25_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P25_S1	Contracts for technology integration consulting generally span one to two years.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P26_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P26_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P26_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P26_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P27_S0	If the Company s estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P27_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P28_S0	Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P29_S0	The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P29_S1	In such contracts, the Company s efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P29_S2	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P29_S3	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P30_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P30_S1	In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P31_S0	services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB 101, as amended by SAB 104.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P31_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P31_S2	In such contracts, the Company s effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P31_S3	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P31_S4	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P32_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P32_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P33_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P33_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P33_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P33_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P33_S4	Deferred transition costs were $547,308 and $508,829 as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P33_S5	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P33_S6	Deferred transition revenues were $553,232 and $496,646 as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues relating to contract costs.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P34_S0	The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P34_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P34_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P34_S3	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P34_S4	VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P35_S0	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P36_S0	Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Company s accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P36_S1	Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company s control.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P36_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P37_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P37_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P38_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) include the margin earned on computer hardware and software, as well as revenues from alliance agreements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P38_S1	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P38_S2	In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P39_S0	The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P40_S0	Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P41_S0	Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P42_S0	Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P43_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P43_S1	A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P43_S2	The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P43_S3	Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P44_S0	Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P44_S1	Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P44_S2	Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P44_S3	Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P45_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds of $1,150,000 and $425,000 as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P46_S0	As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash payables.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P46_S1	Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P47_S0	Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P47_S1	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P48_S0	August 31, 2011 and 2010, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $73,296 and $104,753, respectively.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P48_S1	The allowance reflects the Company s best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P49_S0	In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P49_S1	The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P50_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P50_S1	The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P50_S2	Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P51_S0	Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than 90 days but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P51_S1	Investments with an original maturity greater than one year are considered to be long-term investments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P51_S2	Marketable short-term and long-term investments are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale investments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P51_S3	Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P52_S0	Quoted market prices are used to determine the fair values of common equity and debt securities that were issued by publicly traded entities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P52_S1	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P52_S2	Realized gains and losses on securities are determined based on the First In, First Out method and are included in (Loss) gain on investments, net.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P52_S3	The Company does not hold these investments for speculative or trading purposes.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P53_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P53_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P54_S0	Lesser of lease term or 15 years Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P54_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P54_S2	If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P55_S0	Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P56_S0	(1) For additional information, see Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P57_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September 2010, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) on revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P57_S1	The guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance; requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price; and requires a vendor to use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, respectively, do not exist as estimates of selling price.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P58_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P58_S1	On September 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB on business combinations.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P58_S2	The guidance establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition-related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P59_S0	The Company s adoption of the guidance on business combinations did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P59_S1	On September 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB on noncontrolling interests, which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, previously referred to as minority interest, to be presented as a separate component in the shareholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P59_S2	As required, the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P60_S0	The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P60_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company is not aware of any events or transactions (other than those disclosed herein) that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to filing that would require recognition or disclosure in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P61_S0	Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P62_S0	(1) Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture SCA Class I common shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P62_S1	The income effect does not take into account Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests other, since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P63_S0	(2) Fiscal 2010 and 2009 diluted weighted average Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the payment of cash dividends.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P63_S1	This did not result in a change to previously reported Diluted earnings per share.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P64_S0	For fiscal 2011, there were no options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise price would render them anti-dilutive.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P64_S1	For fiscal 2010 and 2009, 110,294 and 193,143 options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices would render them anti-dilutive.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S0	In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S1	These liabilities included certain non-income tax liabilities, such as stamp taxes, as well as liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S2	These primarily represent unusual and disproportionate individual income tax exposures assumed by certain, but not all, of the Company s shareholders and partners in certain tax jurisdictions specifically related to the transfer of their partnership interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S3	The Company identified certain shareholders and partners who may incur such unusual and disproportionate financial damage in certain jurisdictions.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S4	These include shareholders and partners who were subject to tax in their jurisdiction on items of income arising from the reorganization transaction that were not taxable for most other shareholders and partners.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S5	In addition, certain other shareholders and partners were subject to a different rate or amount of tax than other shareholders or partners in the same jurisdiction.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S6	When additional taxes are assessed on these shareholders or partners in connection with these transfers, the Company has made and intends to make payments, and in one country has contractually committed, to reimburse certain costs associated with the assessment either to the shareholder or partner, or to the taxing authority.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S7	The Company has recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities are probable.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P65_S8	Interest accruals are made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P66_S0	The Company s reorganization activity was as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P67_S0	(1) Includes final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P67_S1	As of August 31, 2011, reorganization liabilities of $294,798 were included in Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months, and reorganization liabilities of $12,488 were included in Other non-current liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P67_S2	Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P68_S0	amounts in settlement or judgment of these matters and/or recording of a reorganization benefit or cost in the Company s Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P68_S1	It is possible the aggregate amount of such payments in connection with resolution of all such proceedings could exceed the currently recorded amounts.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P69_S0	As of August 31, 2011, only a small number of jurisdictions remain that have active audits/investigations or open statutes of limitations, and only one is significant (which is the country referenced above).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P69_S1	In that country, current and former partners, and the Company, are engaged in disputes with tax authorities in connection with the corporate reorganization in 2001, some of which have resulted, and others of which are expected to result, in litigation.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P69_S2	These individuals and the Company intend to vigorously defend their positions.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P70_S0	Restructuring The Company recognized restructuring costs of $252,566 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P70_S1	The restructuring costs included $110,338 principally related to global consolidation of office space and $142,228 related to realignment of the Company s workforce, primarily at the senior executive level.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P70_S2	The restructuring costs were allocated to the reportable operating segments as follows: $49,192 to Communications High Tech; $53,155 to Financial Services; $45,818 to Health Public Service; $58,091 to Products; and $46,310 to Resources.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P70_S3	The restructuring liabilities as of August 31, 2011 were $71,250, of which $17,815 was included in Other accrued liabilities and $53,435 was included in Other non-current liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P70_S4	The restructuring liabilities as of August 31, 2010 were $94,558, of which $28,574 was included in Other accrued liabilities and $65,984 was included in Other non-current liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P70_S5	The remaining liabilities represent the net present value of estimated obligations for operating leases on abandoned office space.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P70_S6	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P71_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The components of Property and equipment, net were as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P72_S0	6. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL During fiscal 2011, the Company acquired the net assets of a provider of software solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P72_S1	In addition, during fiscal 2011, the Company completed four individually immaterial acquisitions.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P72_S2	The total consideration for all fiscal 2011 acquisitions was $306,187.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P72_S3	In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded combined goodwill of $254,975, a portion of which was allocated to each of the reportable segments.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P75_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P75_S1	Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P75_S2	Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P75_S3	The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P75_S4	The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P76_S0	Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P76_S1	Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Company s derivative financial instruments, was approximately $79,243 as of August 31, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P76_S2	The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P76_S3	These provisions may reduce the Company s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P76_S4	Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P76_S5	Similarly, a decrement in the Company s credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P77_S0	The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August 31, 2011 was $20,570.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P78_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P78_S1	Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P78_S2	All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P78_S3	Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P78_S4	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P79_S0	Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P79_S1	To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P79_S2	The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P79_S3	As of August 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P80_S0	The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P80_S1	Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P81_S0	The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P81_S1	The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P82_S0	The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P83_S0	For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P83_S1	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2011 and 2010 was not material.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P83_S2	In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2011 or 2010.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P83_S3	The activity related to the change in net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows: As of August 31, 2011, $8,678 of the amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P84_S0	Other Derivatives The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P84_S1	These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P84_S2	Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net gain of $112,118 and $29,574 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P95_S1	For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P96_S0	During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a net increase of $13,407 in the valuation allowance, primarily due to foreign currency translation.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P96_S1	The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2011 of $658,169.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P96_S2	Of this amount, $68,159 expires between 2012 and 2017, $47,360 expires between 2018 and 2031, and $542,650 has an indefinite carryforward period.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P96_S6	The differences of $840,645 and $550,501, respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P96_S7	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: For the year ended August 31, 2010, substantially all of the additions for tax positions related to prior years are for items that had no net impact to the consolidated financial statements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P97_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P97_S1	During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized approximately $73,016, $42,489 and $47,498 in interest and penalties, respectively.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P97_S2	The Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $285,458 ($198,646, net of tax benefits) and $222,499 ($153,719, net of tax benefits) on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P98_S2	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $793,000 or increase by approximately $86,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P98_S3	The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P98_S4	As of August 31, 2011, the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $1,795,121 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P99_S1	In addition, the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P100_S0	Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P100_S1	Certain postemployment benefits, including severance benefits, disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits, such as healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage, are provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P100_S2	These costs are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P101_S0	The Company uses an August 31 measurement date for its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P101_S1	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fiscal year-end defined benefit pension obligations are as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P102_S0	The Company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S. Plans is to match the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P102_S1	The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P102_S2	The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P102_S3	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P103_S0	Pension Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $110,332, $76,425 and $64,400 respectively.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P105_S1	The estimated amounts that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2011 into net periodic pension expense during fiscal 2012 are as follows: Funded Status for Defined Benefit Plans The accumulated benefit obligation for material defined benefit pension plans as of August 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P105_S2	The following information is provided for material defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and for plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of August 31, 2011 and 2010:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P106_S0	Investment Strategies U.S. Pension Plans The overall investment objective of the plans is to provide growth in the defined benefit pension plans assets to help fund future defined benefit pension obligations while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P106_S1	The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Company s current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P106_S2	The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P106_S3	Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P106_S4	Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P107_S0	Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P107_S1	The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P107_S2	In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P108_S0	Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P108_S1	Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P109_S0	In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P109_S1	Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P110_S0	Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P111_S0	Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P111_S1	In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of equities and fixed income instruments.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P111_S2	Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P112_S0	To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to debt securities which appropriately match the duration of individual plan s liabilities.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P112_S1	Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P113_S0	Plan Assets The Company s target allocation for fiscal 2012 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2011 and 2010 by asset category, for material defined benefit pension plans are as follows: Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P113_S1	The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P113_S2	In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Company s own credit risk.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P114_S0	The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P114_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P114_S2	The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P115_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P116_S0	The fair values of the material U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans assets as of August 31, 2011 are as follows: Expected Contributions Generally, annual contributions are made at such times and in amounts as required by law and may, from time to time, exceed minimum funding requirements.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P116_S1	The Company estimates it will pay approximately $64,000 in fiscal 2012 related to contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, cash funding for its retiree medical plans and benefit payments related to the unfunded frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P116_S2	The Company has not determined whether it will make additional voluntary contributions for its defined benefit pension plans.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P117_S0	Estimated Future Benefit Payments Benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P118_S0	In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined contribution plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P118_S1	Defined contribution plans in countries other than the United States and the United Kingdom are individually immaterial.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P118_S2	Total expenses recorded for the United States and the United Kingdom defined contribution plans were $235,439, $223,793 and $232,661 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P183_S1	The following description of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ) is provided for general information purposes.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P183_S2	Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P184_S0	Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the VEIP ).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P185_S0	General Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company is authorized to issue or transfer up to 45,000,000 Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P186_S0	The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P186_S1	The Company pays all expenses of the Plan.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P186_S2	The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P187_S0	The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P187_S1	The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P188_S0	In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
1467373_11_ITEM14_P188_S1	The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P188_S2	The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P189_S0	Contributions Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as is permitted by the Committee.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P189_S1	Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is 10% (up to a maximum of $7,500 per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P189_S2	Under the VEIP, eligible senior executives may choose to contribute up to 30% of their total compensation towards the purchase of Shares.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P189_S3	The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P189_S4	Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit as is permitted by the Committee.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P190_S0	A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the applicable offering period as determined by the Committee.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P190_S1	Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P190_S2	All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account under the Plan and are deposited with the general funds of the Company.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P190_S3	All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P190_S4	Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal 2011 included the six-month periods ended November 1, 2010 and May 1, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P190_S5	The current offering period commenced on May 2, 2011 and will end on November 1, 2011.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P191_S0	The VEIP has a calendar year offering period and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5 th of the subsequent month.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P191_S1	As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P191_S2	Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P191_S3	A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:
1467373_11_ITEM14_P192_S0	As of August 31, 2011, 9,106,784 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares had been issued under the Plan.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P193_S0	Withdrawals Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period or from the Plan under such terms and conditions as are established by the Committee in its sole discretion.

1467373_11_ITEM14_P194_S2	A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P195_S0	The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan (or pursuant to outstanding awards) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P196_S0	In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any option as of the date of consummation of the change in control.
1467373_11_ITEM14_P197_S0	Plan Amendment and Termination The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan, or without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan.

1467373_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Competition We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services competitive with those we offer.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:
1467373_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	global reach and scale, including level of presence in key emerging markets.

1467373_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Organizational Structure Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than Class I common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares ( Accenture SCA ).
1467373_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	Accenture plc s only business is to hold these shares.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	As the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plc s majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P70_S2	We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P70_S3	Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Accenture SCA Class I common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P71_S3	The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction ).
1467373_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	In the Transaction, all of the outstanding Class A and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued Class A and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd Class A and Class X common shares, as applicable (and cash for any fractional shares).
1467373_12_ITEM1_P73_S2	Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report with respect to periods prior to September 1, 2009 reflect the consolidated operations of Accenture Ltd (the predecessor registrant of Accenture plc) and its subsidiaries.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report reflect the ownership interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain of our current and former senior executives as noncontrolling interests.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 8% as of August 31, 2012.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	As described above under History, Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture SCA Class I common shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S3	Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S4	Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S5	A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S6	Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S7	Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares Only Accenture and our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA Class I common shares.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S8	Each Class I common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P76_S9	As of October 22, 2012, Accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 93% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 7% of the voting interest held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCA s articles of association.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	Under Accenture SCA s articles of association, the market value of a Class I common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i) the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the Class A ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii) if Accenture plc sells its Class A ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the Class A ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P77_S3	In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P77_S4	Except in the case of a redemption of Class I common shares or a transfer of Class I common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCA s articles of association provide that Accenture SCA Class I common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA Class I common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture SCA Class I common shares in the tender offer).
1467373_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.
1467373_12_ITEM1_P79_S3	The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture SCA.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Developments, such as the recent recessions and instability in the U.S. and Europe, government spending restrictions potentially occurring at the end of calendar year 2012 in the United States (commonly referred to as the fiscal cliff), deterioration in the Chinese economy, and the inflationary risks associated with higher commodity prices, among other developments, may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives or terminate existing contracts, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in Europe and North America.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Weakening demand in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S8	This could result, for example, in us having to use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and resulting changes in demand patters to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S13	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P1_S14	In addition, developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, could shift demand to services and solutions where we are less competitive, or might require significant investment by us to upgrade, enhance or expand our services and solutions to meet that demand.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	If a client is dissatisfied with our services and we are unable to effectively respond to its needs, the client might terminate existing contracts, or reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S7	For example, in fiscal 2009, we experienced a higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings as a result of challenging economic conditions and clients being acquired, which negatively affected our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S8	It could also result in pressure to reduce the cost of our services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S9	For example, during fiscal years 2009 and 2010, challenging economic conditions led to our moving work more quickly into our Global Delivery Network than planned in order to respond to client demand to reduce costs, which resulted in our revenues being less than anticipated.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S10	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S12	Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S13	We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S14	For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S15	As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S16	Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S17	We are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S18	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S19	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S20	Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate skills.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S21	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S22	If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S23	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P3_S24	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed, and particularly in emerging markets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which it can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	There is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S6	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S7	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S9	For example, there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases, and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S12	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S13	We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S14	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S15	As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P9_S16	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally, and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our growth strategy might not be successful.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S8	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S9	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets, which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S10	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, like the earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan in March 2011, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S12	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S13	These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S14	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S15	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S16	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S17	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S18	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S19	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S20	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S21	This includes in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S22	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S23	Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P13_S24	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our employees, subcontractors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S7	For example, the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P15_S8	In the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, operations in that country or in Europe generally may be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our currency hedging program, which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S7	This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S9	These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S10	We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P16_S11	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	For example, natural disasters of the type described above, some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Additionally, both the Philippines and India have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability and worker strikes.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	India in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including Pakistan.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully above, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S11	If we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P17_S12	The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our pricing for our services and solutions is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned, or be unprofitable.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Our pricing, cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting work and frequently on our outsourcing work, include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale projects or enterprises.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us, or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P24_S6	As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above, and may in the future experience adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., Congressional sequestration of funds under the Budget Control Act of 2011) or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the United States and Europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Legislative proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect Accenture.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or otherwise breach obligations, to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P33_S7	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In addition to expense, litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, and litigation results can be unpredictable.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond our core business that will enable us to differentiate our services and solutions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S7	If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S8	In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S9	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P36_S10	Our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliances partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Outsourcing services and the continued expansion of our other services and solutions into new areas subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Outsourcing services, which represented approximately 44% of our net revenues in fiscal 2012, present different operational risks, when compared to our consulting and systems integration services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Disruptions in service or other performance problems could damage our clients businesses, expose us to claims, and harm our reputation and our business.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We have continued to expand our services and solutions into new business areas, and we expect to continue to expand our services and solutions in these and other new areas in the future.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Expanding into new areas may expose us to additional regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P39_S6	If a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements, there is a risk that we could face legal liability.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Many of our clients request that we obtain an audit under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 and International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402, formerly referred to as SAS 70.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If we receive a qualified opinion, or do not deliver the audit reports timely, our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	or prevent us from offering some services or solutions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, injure our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Additionally, individuals and firms have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	If a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients, an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S7	We could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Third-party suppliers of software, hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued, and this could disrupt use of their products or services by Accenture and our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S9	If our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S10	We have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S11	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S12	Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S13	We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S14	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S15	Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S16	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P42_S17	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Depending on the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In certain situations, we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S4	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S5	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies or delivery failures.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S7	There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S9	Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S10	We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S11	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S12	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S13	We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S14	We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S15	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S16	Ongoing business may be disrupted and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S17	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P43_S18	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We might not achieve our expected return on investment, or may lose money.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	By their nature, joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself, particularly when we have a minority position.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions or joint ventures for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S6	We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, global consolidation of our office space and re-alignment of portions of our non-client-facing workforce to lower-cost locations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P45_S7	These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Over time, we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs, we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management, to the same degree as in the past.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P48_S5	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Changes in our level of taxes, and audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P50_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Increases in the tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As of August 31, 2012, we had approximately 257,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S4	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Finally, the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S6	For example, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S7	If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S8	If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S9	Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S10	We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S11	In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S12	We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S13	Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S14	We might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S15	Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S16	This could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S17	In addition, in certain geographies and industries, some clients have requested extended payment terms more frequently, and if this trend continues, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S18	Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S19	If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S20	In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S21	Our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P53_S22	Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to our overall revenue growth and revenue growth for our priority emerging markets and earnings per share growth.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	As a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, our share price could be difficult to predict, and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P56_S4	We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P57_S4	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P58_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P58_S5	The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2012 of Ireland (the Companies Acts ).
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P63_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1467373_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability.
1467373_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

1467373_12_ITEM5_P6_S3	These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.
1467373_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

1467373_12_ITEM5_P7_S2	We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture.
1467373_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash and employee forfeitures reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share.
1467373_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	_______________ (1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , we acquired a total of 691,448 Accenture SCA Class I common shares and 25,300 Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares from current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees by means of purchase or redemption for cash, or employee forfeiture, as applicable.
1467373_12_ITEM5_P9_S1	In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , we issued 1,347,904 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to a registration statement.
1467373_12_ITEM5_P10_S0	(2) Average price paid per share reflects the total cash outlay for the period, divided by the number of shares acquired, including those acquired by purchase or redemption for cash and any acquired by means of employee forfeiture.
1467373_12_ITEM5_P10_S1	(3) As of August 31, 2012 , our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $4,179 million , which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs.
1467373_12_ITEM5_P11_S0	Since August 2001 and as of August 31, 2012 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $20.1 billion for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	_______________ (2) On September 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) on noncontrolling interests.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	As required, the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	Prior to fiscal 2010, Net income was referred to as Income before minority interest and Net income attributable to Accenture plc was referred to as Net income.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	_______________ (1) In early fiscal 2010, we announced a move to declare and pay cash dividends on a semi-annual basis.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	During fiscal 2010, we paid a final annual cash dividend of $0.75 in addition to a transitional semi-annual cash dividend of $0.375.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P2_S2	(2) Diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2012 payment of cash dividends.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P2_S3	This restatement resulted in a one cent decrease in diluted earnings per share from $3.40 to $3.39 for fiscal 2011.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	_______________ (1) On September 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB on noncontrolling interests.
1467373_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	As required, the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	We use the terms Accenture, we, the Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	For example, a reference to fiscal 2012 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	There continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world, as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many of the markets where we operate, which could impact our business, particularly in the United States and Europe.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	Such volatility and uncertainty has adversely affected and will in the future affect our clients and the levels of business activities in some industries and geographies where we operate, which may reduce demand for our services.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	This has also impacted the types of services our clients are demanding; for example, clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S6	These changing demand patterns could have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P2_S7	We continue to monitor this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $6.84 billion , compared with $6.69 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Net revenues for fiscal 2012 were $27.86 billion , compared with $25.51 billion for fiscal 2011 , an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	All of our operating groups experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and continued to moderate in consulting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	We expect the level of year-over-year growth to continue to moderate in the near term and vary across operating groups and geographic regions, with growth in certain areas of our business, offset by lower growth or declines in other areas, particularly in consulting and in Europe.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $3.74 billion , compared with $3.88 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , a decrease of 4% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 2% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S6	Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2012 were $15.56 billion , compared with $14.92 billion for fiscal 2011 , an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S7	Four of our five operating groups, including Health Public Service, Financial Services, Resources and Products, experienced quarterly year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while Communications, Media Technology experienced a significant decline in quarterly year-over-year revenue.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S8	In our consulting business overall, clients are exercising caution by reducing their demand for small projects.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S9	In addition, when larger projects are initiated, they are of longer duration and convert to revenue at a slower rate.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S10	These trends have led to lower consulting revenue growth and declines in certain areas of our business, and we expect this to continue in the near term.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S11	Clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S12	We are also experiencing growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including analytics, cloud computing and mobility.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S13	Compared to fiscal 2011 , we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network, and we expect this trend to continue.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S14	While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable, and we saw some improvement in certain areas of our business.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S15	In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $3.10 billion , compared with $2.81 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P3_S16	Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2012 were $12.30 billion , compared with $10.58 billion for fiscal 2011 , an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars and 19% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , led by very significant growth in Financial Services and very strong growth in Products, Communication, Media Technology and Resources.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	This strong demand for outsourcing services resulted in a greater proportion of revenues in outsourcing, particularly in Communications, Media Technology and Financial Services, and this trend is expected to continue.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Growth in outsourcing was driven by higher volumes, scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients, as well as services for new clients.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Compared to fiscal 2011 , we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	When compared to fiscal 2011 , the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during fiscal 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	This resulted in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue results that were approximately 7% and 2% lower than our revenue results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 , respectively.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was approximately 87% , flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2012 , and within our target range.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S5	This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S6	We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S7	We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S8	Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 257,000 as of August 31, 2012 , compared with approximately 249,000 as of May 31, 2012 and 236,000 as of August 31, 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S9	The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P7_S10	Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 12% , down from 13% in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2012 became effective September 1, 2011.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P8_S4	Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services or a decrease in demand due to U.S. government spending reductions; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; recover increases in compensation; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 32.9% , compared with 33.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was 32.3% , compared with 32.9% for fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was lower than for fiscal 2011 , principally due to higher payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues, including costs associated with integration of acquisitions and investments in offerings, partially offset by higher contract profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , compared with 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.4% for fiscal 2012 , compared with 19.3% for fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, investment in offerings, and marketing- and advertising-related activities.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	These actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lower-cost locations.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	For fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 , sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 20 basis points, while general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 60 basis points.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	These decreases were principally due to growth of these costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our margins could be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $940 million , compared with $923 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2012 was $3,872 million , compared with $3,470 million for fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 13.8% , flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	Operating margin for fiscal 2012 was 13.9% , compared with 13.6% for fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S7	We seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P12_S8	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $9.21 billion , with consulting bookings of $4.27 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.94 billion .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	New contract bookings for fiscal 2012 were $32.23 billion , with consulting bookings of $16.61 billion and outsourcing bookings of $15.62 billion .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Clients continue to seek flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting work.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P26_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P32_S5	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P33_S4	VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P43_S4	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P43_S5	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P43_S6	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P45_S6	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media Technology, Financial Services, Health Public Service, Products and Resources.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P48_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	_______________ n/m = not meaningful (1) On September 1, 2011, the Company renamed the Communications High Tech operating group to Communications, Media Technology.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	No amounts have been reclassified in any period in connection with this name change.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	(2) May not total due to rounding.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	(3) EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Africa.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues within fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010 :
1467373_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net Revenues Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing during fiscal 2012 .

1467373_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, led by Electronics High Tech in EMEA, principally due to a significant short-term increase from one contract.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	We also experienced outsourcing growth in Communications across all geographic regions.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	Consulting revenues declined slightly, with growth in the first half of fiscal 2012 offset by contraction during the second half of the fiscal year.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	For fiscal 2012, consulting revenues reflected a decline in Communications in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Media Entertainment in Americas and Electronics High Tech in Asia Pacific.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P54_S5	Some of our clients, primarily in Communications, continued to exercise caution by reducing and/or deferring their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P54_S6	We expect Communications, Media Technology net revenues to decline year-over-year in the near term.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by all industry groups in Americas, including the impact of an acquisition in Banking.

1467373_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, driven by significant growth in Insurance across all geographic regions, including the impact of an acquisition.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	This growth was partially offset by declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas and Capital Markets in EMEA.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	The uncertainty in the banking and capital markets industries impacted our consulting revenue growth during fiscal 2012 and we expect this trend to continue in the near term.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Health Public Service net revenues increased 11% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, led by Health across all geographic regions and Public Service in Asia Pacific.

1467373_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	Outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2011 reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The global uncertainty and challenges in the public sector continue to have an impact on demand in our public service business.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	This impact may increase if U.S. government spending reductions are implemented.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Products net revenues increased 13% in local currency.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Consulting revenues increased, driven primarily by growth across all industry groups in Americas and most industry groups in Asia Pacific.

1467373_12_ITEM7_P62_S6	Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was lower than for fiscal 2011 , principally due to higher payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues, including costs associated with investments in offerings and acquisitions, partially offset by higher contract profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P62_S7	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 was $3,303 million , an increase of $209 million , or 7% , over fiscal 2011 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.1% during this period.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P62_S8	The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to growth of business development costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P62_S9	General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2012 were $1,811 million , a decrease of $9 million , or 1% , from fiscal 2011 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.5% from 7.1% during this period.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P62_S10	The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P62_S11	In addition, during fiscal 2011, we recorded a provision for litigation matters for $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues, which was partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2012 was $3,872 million , an increase of $401 million , or 12% , over fiscal 2011 , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.9% from 13.6% during this period.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	_______________ (1) May not total due to rounding.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	On September 1, 2011, the Company renamed the Communications High Tech operating group to Communications, Media Technology.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	No amounts have been reclassified in any period in connection with this name change.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	During fiscal 2012 , the results of each operating group benefited from our management of general and administrative costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	In addition, during fiscal 2011, each operating group recorded a portion of the $75 million provision for litigation matters, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2012 , compared with fiscal 2011 , exclusive of these impacts.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Communications, Media Technology operating income increased, primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth, principally related to a significant short-term increase from one contract.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to a lower proportion of high margin consulting work, costs related to recent acquisitions and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by strong outsourcing revenue growth.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Health Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by the negative impact of delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Health Public Service operating margin was impacted by administrative and compliance costs associated with our U.S. Federal practice, and we expect this trend to continue.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	Health Public Service profitability could also be impacted if U.S. government spending reductions are implemented.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Products operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved consulting and outsourcing contract profitability.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Resources operating income increased, primarily due to strong revenue growth.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Interest Income Interest income for fiscal 2012 was $43 million , an increase of $1 million , or 4% , over fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	The increase was primarily due to higher cash balances.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Other Income, net Other income, net for fiscal 2012 was $6 million , a decrease of $11 million from fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	The change was driven primarily by lower net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 27.6% , compared with 27.3% for fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	The effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 included higher expenses for increases in tax reserves and changes in our geographic mix of income, partially offset by higher benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2012 was $271 million , a decrease of $4 million , or 2% , from fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 9% for fiscal 2012 from 10% for fiscal 2011 , partially offset by an increase in Net income of $272 million .

1467373_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Health Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth, including revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability.

1467373_12_ITEM7_P104_S4	We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2013 .
1467373_12_ITEM7_P104_S5	The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P104_S6	Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.

1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S3	Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S4	Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S5	The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S6	For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S7	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P109_S8	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2012, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) on fair value measurements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, i.e. an exit price.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P110_S2	Additionally, any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 asset valuation classifications must be disclosed, including the reasons for the transfers.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1467373_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2012 , it was anticipated that $28 million of the net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12 months.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $402 million and $358 million as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2012 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and iii.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P0_S5	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page F-2.
1467373_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Accenture plc : We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2012.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S2	Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P9_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P10_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P10_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P11_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Accenture plc is one of the world s leading organizations providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture plc seeks to deliver competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	Accenture plc s global delivery model enables it to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company ).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	Accenture plc s only business is to hold Class I common shares in, and to act as the sole general partner of, its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P17_S2	The Company operates its business through Accenture SCA and subsidiaries of Accenture SCA.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P17_S3	Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P17_S4	The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P17_S5	The noncontrolling interest percentages were 8% and 9% as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Company s fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	For example, a reference to fiscal 2012 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P19_S2	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	Reincorporation in Ireland On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of the Company s parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction ).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	The Transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became the Company s parent holding company.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P20_S2	Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Reclassifications Certain amounts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P24_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P24_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	In such contracts, the Company s efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P27_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P27_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	In such contracts, the Company s effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P29_S3	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P29_S4	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S4	Deferred transition costs were $538,638 and $547,308 as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S5	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S6	Deferred transition revenues were $551,364 and $553,232 as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues relating to contract costs.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P31_S7	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Company s accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company s control.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) include the margin earned on computer hardware and software, as well as revenues from alliance agreements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P42_S2	The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P42_S3	Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds of $1,265,000 and $1,150,000 as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash payables.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	As of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $64,874 and $73,296 , respectively.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	The allowance reflects the Company s best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P48_S2	Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than 90 days but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	Investments with an original maturity greater than one year are considered to be long-term investments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	Marketable short-term and long-term investments are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale investments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	securities that were issued by publicly traded entities.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	Realized gains and losses on securities are determined based on the First In, First Out method and are included in Loss on investments, net.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P50_S3	The Company does not hold these investments for speculative or trading purposes.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	_______________ (1) For additional information, see Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2012, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) on fair value measurements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, i.e. an exit price.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	Additionally, any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 asset valuation classifications must be disclosed, including the reasons for the transfers.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	_______________ (1) Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture SCA Class I common shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	The income effect does not take into account Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests other, since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	(2) Fiscal 2011 and 2010 diluted weighted average Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2012 payment of cash dividends.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	This restatement resulted in a one cent decrease in diluted earnings per share from $3.40 to $3.39 for fiscal 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P59_S4	For fiscal 2012 and 2011 , there were no options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise price would render them anti-dilutive.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P59_S5	For fiscal 2010 , 110,294 options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices would render them anti-dilutive.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	These liabilities included certain non-income tax liabilities, such as stamp taxes, as well as liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	These primarily represent unusual and disproportionate individual income tax exposures assumed by certain, but not all, of the Company s shareholders and partners in certain tax jurisdictions specifically related to the transfer of their partnership interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Company identified certain shareholders and partners who may incur such unusual and disproportionate financial damage in certain jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S4	These include shareholders and partners who were subject to tax in their jurisdiction on items of income arising from the reorganization transaction that were not taxable for most other shareholders and partners.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S5	In addition, certain other shareholders and partners were subject to a different rate or amount of tax than other shareholders or partners in the same jurisdiction.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S6	When additional taxes are assessed on these shareholders or partners in connection with these transfers, the Company has made and intends to make payments, and in one country has contractually committed, to reimburse certain costs associated with the assessment either to the shareholder or partner, or to the taxing authority.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S7	The Company has recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities are probable.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P60_S8	Interest accruals are made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company s reorganization activity was as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	_______________ (1) Includes final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	As of August 31, 2012 , reorganization liabilities of $257,589 were included in Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months, and reorganization liabilities of $11,217 were included in Other non-current liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P62_S3	Final resolution, through settlement, conclusion of legal proceedings or a tax authority s decision not to pursue a claim, will result in payment by the Company of amounts in settlement or judgment of these matters and/or recording of a reorganization benefit or cost in the Company s Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P62_S4	It is possible the aggregate amount of such payments in connection with resolution of all such proceedings could exceed the currently recorded amounts.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	As of August 31, 2012 , only a small number of jurisdictions remain that have active audits/investigations or open statutes of limitations, and only one is significant (which is the country referenced above).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	In that country, current and former partners, and the Company, are engaged in disputes with tax authorities in connection with the corporate reorganization in 2001, some of which have resulted, and others of which are expected to result, in litigation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	These individuals and the Company intend to vigorously defend their positions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The components of Property and equipment, net were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	6. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL During fiscal 2012 , the Company acquired the net assets of a provider of residential and commercial mortgage processing services.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	In addition, the Company completed four individually immaterial acquisitions.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P68_S4	The Company also recorded $81,735 in intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and intellectual property.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P68_S5	The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of less than one to fifteen years.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	The pro forma effects on the Company s operations were not material.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	During fiscal 2010 , the Company completed several individually immaterial acquisitions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	Based on the results of its annual impairment analysis, the Company determined that no impairment existed as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable operating segment were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	_______________ (1) On September 1, 2011, the Company renamed the Communications High Tech operating group to Communications, Media Technology.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	No amounts have been reclassified in any period in connection with this name change.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P73_S3	The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P73_S4	The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Company s derivative financial instruments, was approximately $61,486 as of August 31, 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P74_S3	These provisions may reduce the Company s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P74_S4	Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P74_S5	Similarly, a decrement in the Company s credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August 31, 2012 was $94,076 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P76_S2	All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P76_S3	Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P76_S4	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	As of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P78_S2	Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 , was not material.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	The activity related to the change in net unrealized (losses) gains on cash flow hedges, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows:

1467373_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company recorded valuation allowances of $221,015 and $246,667 as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	During fiscal 2012 , the Company recorded a net decrease of $25,652 in the valuation allowance, primarily due to foreign currency translation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2012 of $652,062 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	Of this amount, $74,624 expires between 2013 and 2018 , $57,989 expires between 2019 and 2031 , and $519,449 has an indefinite carryforward period.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P94_S6	The differences of $791,024 and $840,645 , respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 , the Company recognized (benefit) expense of $(98,765) , $59,950 and $36,542 in interest and penalties, respectively.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S4	The audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2003 to 2005 closed during fiscal 2012.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S5	The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S6	Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S7	With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2004.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S8	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $637,000 or increase by approximately $208,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S9	The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S10	As of August 31, 2012 , the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $2,116,263 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S12	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P96_S13	Portions of the Company s operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal 2013 and 2016 .

1467373_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	In addition, the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	Certain postemployment benefits, including severance benefits, disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits, such as healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage, are provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	These costs are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company uses an August 31 measurement date for its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fiscal year-end defined benefit pension obligations were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S. Plans is to match the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P100_S3	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	Pension Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $102,555 , $110,332 and $76,425 respectively.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	The changes in the defined benefit pension obligations, plan assets and funded status of material defined benefit pension plans for fiscal 2012 and 2011 were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	The pre-tax accumulated net actuarial loss and prior service cost (credit) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2012 was as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	The estimated amounts that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2012 into net periodic pension expense during fiscal 2013 are as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	Funded Status for Defined Benefit Plans The accumulated benefit obligation for material defined benefit pension plans as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	The following information is provided for material defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and for plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1467373_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Investment Strategies U.S. Pension Plans The overall investment objective of the plans is to provide growth in the defined benefit pension plans assets to help fund future defined benefit pension obligations while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P109_S1	Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P109_S2	Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P111_S1	Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P112_S1	Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of equities and fixed income instruments.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P114_S2	Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to debt securities which appropriately match the duration of individual plan s liabilities.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	Plan Assets The Company s target allocation for fiscal 2013 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2012 and 2011 by asset category, for material defined benefit pension plans were as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P117_S2	In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Company s own credit risk.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P118_S2	The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The fair values of the material U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans assets as of August 31, 2012 are as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during fiscal 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Expected Contributions Generally, annual contributions are made at such times and in amounts as required by law and may, from time to time, exceed minimum funding requirements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	The Company estimates it will pay approximately $572,385 in fiscal 2013 related to contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, cash funding for its retiree medical plans and benefit payments related to the unfunded frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P122_S2	The above estimate includes the payment of a discretionary contribution of $500,000 to the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans that is expected to be funded during the first half of fiscal 2013.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P583_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ) as of August 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2012 and the period from February 4, 2010 (inception) to August 31, 2010.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P583_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan s management.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P583_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P583_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P583_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P584_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P584_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P584_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1467373_12_ITEM15_P585_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P586_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P587_S0	The following description of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ) is provided for general information purposes.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P587_S1	Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P588_S0	Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the VEIP ).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P589_S0	General Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company is authorized to issue or transfer up to 45,000,000 Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P590_S0	The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P590_S1	The Company pays all expenses of the Plan.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P590_S2	The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P591_S0	The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P591_S1	The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P592_S0	In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P592_S1	The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P592_S2	The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P593_S0	Contributions Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as is permitted by the Committee.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P593_S1	Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is 10% (up to a maximum of $7,500 per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P593_S2	Under the VEIP, eligible senior executives may choose to contribute up to 30% of their total compensation towards the purchase of Shares.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P593_S3	The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P593_S4	Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit based on a percentage of total eligible senior executive compensation as defined by the Plan and permitted by the Committee.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P593_S5	The aggregate participation limit percentage was 11% prior to July 25, 2012 at which time the Committee resolved to increase the percentage to 15%.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P593_S6	If aggregate compensation is projected to reach this cap, then contributions will stop and participants would be refunded contributions not used to purchase shares.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P594_S0	A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the applicable offering period as determined by the Committee.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P594_S1	Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P594_S2	All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account under the Plan and are deposited with the general funds of the Company.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P594_S3	All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P594_S4	Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal 2012 included the six-month periods ended November 1, 2011 and May 1, 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P594_S5	The current offering period commenced on May 2, 2012 and will end on November 1, 2012 .
1467373_12_ITEM15_P595_S0	The VEIP has a calendar year offering period and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5 th of the subsequent month.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P596_S0	Share Purchases As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P596_S1	Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P596_S2	A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:
1467373_12_ITEM15_P597_S0	As of August 31, 2012 , 16,513,511 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares had been issued under the Plan.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P598_S0	Withdrawals Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P598_S1	Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law).
1467373_12_ITEM15_P598_S2	A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P598_S3	A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P599_S0	The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan (or pursuant to outstanding awards) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P600_S0	In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any option as of the date of consummation of the change in control.
1467373_12_ITEM15_P601_S0	Plan Amendment and Termination The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan, or without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan.

1467373_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:
1467373_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	global reach and scale, including level of presence in key emerging markets.

1467373_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Organizational Structure Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than Class I common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares ( Accenture SCA ).
1467373_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	As the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plc s majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P70_S3	Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Accenture SCA Class I common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P71_S3	The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction ).
1467373_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	The Transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P72_S3	On December 1, 2012, we ceased using the designation senior executive.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P72_S4	The majority of our leaders are now designated managing directors, and a select group of our most experienced leaders are senior managing directors.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P72_S5	Managing directors and senior managing directors, along with members of the Accenture global management committee (the Company s primary management and leadership team, which consists of 17 of our most senior leaders), comprise Accenture Leadership.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	The selected financial data included in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, of this report with respect to periods prior to September 1, 2009 reflect the consolidated operations of Accenture Ltd (the predecessor registrant of Accenture plc) and its subsidiaries.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report reflect the ownership interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P73_S2	The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 6% as of August 31, 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	As described above under History, Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture SCA Class I common shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S3	Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S4	Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S5	A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S6	Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P75_S7	Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares Only Accenture and the current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA Class I common shares.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	As of October 15, 2013, Accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 94% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 6% of the voting interest held by the current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCA s articles of association.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	Under Accenture SCA s articles of association, the market value of a Class I common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i) the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the Class A ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii) if Accenture plc sells its Class A ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the Class A ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P77_S3	In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P77_S4	Except in the case of a redemption of Class I common shares or a transfer of Class I common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCA s articles of association provide that Accenture SCA Class I common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P77_S5	In addition, all holders of Class I common shares (except Accenture) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture SCA or transferred to Accenture SCA, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA Class I common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture SCA Class I common shares in the tender offer).
1467373_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.
1467373_13_ITEM1_P78_S3	The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture SCA.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	For example, revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was lower than we expected due, in large part, to lower than expected demand, particularly in certain geographies experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions, such as certain countries in Europe and in Brazil.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in Europe and North America.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Weak demand or a slower than expected recovery in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	could adversely affect our results of operations, as we experienced.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	This could result, for example, in us having to use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In addition, as new technologies become available, such as Software as a Service (SaaS), which continually change the nature of our business, clients may slow spending on legacy technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P2_S10	If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, or delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S8	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S9	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S10	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S12	We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S13	For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S14	As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S15	Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S16	We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S17	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S18	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S19	Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate skills.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P3_S20	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed, particularly in emerging markets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Additionally, if demand for our services were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P7_S7	In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S9	For example, there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P9_S12	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S7	These technologies, and others that may emerge, could reduce, and over time, replace some of our legacy business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S8	In addition, we have seen some clients delaying spending under existing contracts and engagements and entering into new contracts more slowly while they evaluate the new technologies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S10	If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S11	In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P12_S12	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 56 countries around the world.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally, and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our growth strategy might not be successful.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S8	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P13_S9	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets, which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S10	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S11	The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S12	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P14_S14	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our employees, subcontractors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S10	While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S12	For example, natural disasters of the type described above, some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Additionally, both India and the Philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability and worker strikes.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P15_S14	India in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including Pakistan.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business, due to factors such as the mix of work and the number of service providers, among others.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our pricing for our services and solutions is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions, which is based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned, or be unprofitable.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Our pricing, cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, contracts used to deliver services and solutions for new technologies might necessitate the use of alternative pricing models, which could negatively impact our profitability.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	For example, in projects involving our SaaS solutions, revenue is typically generated on a usage basis, which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale projects or enterprises.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us, or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P23_S6	As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above, and may in the future experience adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., Congressional sequestration of funds under the Budget Control Act of 2011) or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the United States and Europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Legislative proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect Accenture.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S6	The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S8	For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or otherwise breach obligations, to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S9	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S10	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S11	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S12	If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P32_S13	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our currency hedging program, which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S7	This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, such as the Indian rupee, could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P34_S9	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliances partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Outsourcing services and the continued expansion of our other services and solutions into new areas subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Outsourcing services, which represented approximately 46% of our net revenues in fiscal 2013, present different operational risks, when compared to our consulting and systems integration services.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Disruptions in service or other performance problems could damage our clients businesses, expose us to claims, and harm our reputation and our business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We have continued to expand our services and solutions into new business areas and provide services to new types of clients, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Expanding into new areas, and providing services to new types of clients may expose us to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P38_S6	If a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements, there is a risk that we could face legal liability.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	No. 16 and International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402, formerly referred to as SAS 70.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we receive a qualified opinion, or do not deliver the audit reports timely, our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S8	In addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S9	If we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P42_S4	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Depending on the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S5	In certain situations, we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S8	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S9	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S10	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S11	There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S12	Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S13	Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S14	We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S15	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S16	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S17	We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S18	We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S19	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S20	Ongoing business may be disrupted and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P43_S21	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Business combination and investment transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities, any of which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	By their nature, joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself, particularly when we have a minority position.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisition and joint ventures for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our non-client-facing workforce to lower-cost locations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P49_S5	These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Over time, we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs, we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management, to the same degree as in the past.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P52_S4	These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P52_S5	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Changes in our level of taxes, and audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P54_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Increases in the tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S7	In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P55_S8	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As of August 31, 2013, we had approximately 275,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S5	The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S6	For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S7	Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S8	If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S9	In addition, from time to time, we make changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S10	If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S11	Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S12	We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S13	In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S14	We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S15	Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate, and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S16	We might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S17	Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S18	This could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S19	In addition, in certain geographies and industries, some clients have requested extended payment terms more frequently, and if this trend continues, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S20	Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S21	If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S22	In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S23	Our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P56_S24	Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to our overall revenue growth and revenue growth for our priority emerging markets and earnings per share growth.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, our share price could be difficult to predict, and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P59_S4	We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S5	The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S6	We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S7	These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P60_S8	If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P62_S4	We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P62_S5	The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2012 of Ireland (the Companies Acts ).
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P67_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1467373_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability.
1467373_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

1467373_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	As required, the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented.

1467373_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	We use the terms Accenture, we, the Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	For example, a reference to fiscal 2013 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in markets around the world, as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide in many of the industries we serve, all of which are impacting, and we expect will continue to impact, our business.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	These conditions have impacted the types of services our clients are demanding.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	Clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and are placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and in some cases, slowing the pace and level of spending on existing contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S6	These changing demand patterns are currently having an adverse impact on the timing of revenue and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P2_S7	We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $7.09 billion , compared with $6.84 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , an increase of 3.7% in U.S. dollars and 4.5% in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Net revenues for fiscal 2013 were $28.56 billion , compared with $27.86 billion for fiscal 2012 , an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Health Public Service, Products, Financial Services and Communications, Media Technology experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while Resources was flat in local currency year-over-year.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Revenue growth in local currency was solid in outsourcing, while consulting revenues reflected modest growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	Revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was lower than we expected due, in large part, to lower than expected demand, particularly in certain geographies experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions, such as certain countries in Europe and in Brazil.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	We expect year-over-year revenues to range from a slight decline to a modest increase in the near term and continue to vary across operating groups and geographic regions, with growth in certain areas of our business partially offset by lower growth or declines in other areas.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S6	In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $3.80 billion , compared with $3.74 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S7	Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2013 were $15.38 billion , compared with $15.56 billion for fiscal 2012 , a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 1% in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S8	Three of our five operating groups, including Health Public Service, Communications, Media Technology and Products, experienced quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency, while Resources and Financial Services experienced declines in quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S9	We continued to enter into a higher proportion of contracts with longer duration that are converting to revenue at a slower pace, and clients slowed the pace and level of their spending.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S10	We expect these trends to continue in the near term.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S11	Clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S12	We continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including analytics, cloud computing and mobility.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S13	Compared to fiscal 2012, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network, and we expect this trend to continue.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P3_S14	The business environment is more competitive and, in some areas, we are experiencing pricing pressures.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $3.28 billion , compared with $3.10 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2013 were $13.18 billion , compared with $12.30 billion for fiscal 2012 , an increase of 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Health Public Service, Financial Services and Products experienced strong year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	Year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency was slight in Resources and declined in Communications, Media Technology.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	Outsourcing revenue growth continued to be moderate, compared to the strong year-over-year growth that we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2013 , as some clients slowed the pace and level of their spending and we expect these trends to continue in the near term.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S6	Compared to fiscal 2012 , we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S7	As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S8	If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P4_S9	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	When compared to fiscal 2012 , the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during fiscal 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	This resulted in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% and 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate the foreign-exchange impact to our fiscal 2014 revenue growth will be 1% lower growth in U.S. dollars than our growth in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was approximately 88% , flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2013 , and within our target range.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S6	We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S7	We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S8	Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 275,000 as of August 31, 2013 , compared with approximately 266,000 as of May 31, 2013 and approximately 257,000 as of August 31, 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S9	The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P6_S10	Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was 12% , flat with both the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2013 became effective September 1, 2012.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; recover increases in compensation; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was 33.2% , compared with 32.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Gross margin for fiscal 2013 was 32.9% , compared with 32.3% for fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2013 was principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , compared with 19.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.6% for fiscal 2013 , compared with 18.4% for fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S5	Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business-development activities; investment in offerings; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and acquisition-related costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S6	General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S7	We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P8_S8	For fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 , sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues increased approximately 30 basis points as a result of higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities, as well as acquisition-related costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Operating expenses for fiscal 2013 included reorganization benefits of $274 million as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	For additional information, see Note 3 (Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, Net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was $984 million , compared with $940 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2013 was $4,339 million , compared with $3,872 million for fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was 13.9% compared with 13.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	Operating margin for fiscal 2013 was 15.2% , compared with 13.9% for fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	The reorganization benefits of $274 million recorded during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2013 increased operating margin by 100 basis points.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S5	Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin would have been 14.2% for fiscal 2013 , an increase of 30 basis points compared with fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S6	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 18.1% .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S7	The above noted reorganization benefits increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S8	In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S9	Absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3% compared with 27.6% in fiscal 2012.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S10	Diluted earnings per share were $4.93 for fiscal 2013 , compared with $3.84 for fiscal 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P10_S11	Absent the above noted reorganization benefits and tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2013, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.21 for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	We seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $8.40 billion , with consulting bookings of $3.86 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.54 billion .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	New contract bookings for fiscal 2013 were $33.28 billion , with consulting bookings of $16.27 billion and outsourcing bookings of $17.01 billion .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Clients continue to enter into contracts that are converting to revenue at a slower pace and clients have slowed the pace and level of their spending, all of which impact the conversion of new contract bookings to revenues.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P29_S5	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S6	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S7	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are: Communications, Media Technology; Financial Services; Health Public Service; Products; and Resources.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S8	Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S9	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S10	Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P43_S11	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P44_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	_______________ n/m = not meaningful (1) EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Africa.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	(2) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011 :
1467373_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net Revenues Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency moderated during the second half of fiscal 2013 compared to the first half of fiscal 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Financial Services, Products and Health Public Service experienced strong growth in outsourcing revenues in local currency during fiscal 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was slight in Resources and declined in Communications, Media Technology.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	Consulting revenues were flat in local currency during fiscal 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	Health Public Service experienced strong growth in consulting revenues in local currency during fiscal 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	Consulting revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was slight in Financial Services and declined in Communications, Media Technology, Resources and Products.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Communications, Media Technology net revenues decreased 2% in local currency.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth, driven by growth in Americas across all industry groups and Media Entertainment in EMEA, partially offset by a significant decline in Electronics High Tech in EMEA, principally due to an expected year-over-year revenue decline from one contract.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	The revenue decline on this contract is expected to continue to impact outsourcing revenue growth in the near term.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	In addition, outsourcing revenue growth was impacted by a decline in Electronics High Tech in Asia Pacific.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, due to declines in Communications and Media Entertainment in Americas and Electronics High Tech in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by strong growth in Electronics High Tech in Americas.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	Some of our clients continued to reduce and/or defer their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues during fiscal 2013.

1467373_13_ITEM7_P95_S5	Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.84 for fiscal 2012, compared with $3.39 for fiscal 2011.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P95_S6	The $0.45 increase in our earnings per share was due to increases of $0.40 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P95_S7	These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from a higher effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower non-operating income, compared with fiscal 2011.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P95_S8	Diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2012 payment of cash dividends.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P95_S9	This restatement resulted in a one cent decrease in diluted earnings per share from $3.40 to $3.39 for fiscal 2011.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P95_S10	For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:
1467373_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	As of August 31, 2013 , cash and cash equivalents was $5.6 billion , compared with $6.6 billion as of August 31, 2012 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:
1467373_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	_______________ (1) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Operating activities: The reduction in operating cash flow included the impact of a discretionary cash contribution of $500 million made to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan during fiscal 2013, which had a net impact of $350 million, after tax.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	The reduction in operating cash flow was also due to other changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by higher net income.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Investing activities: The $621 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Goodwill) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Financing activities: The $507 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of ordinary shares and an increase in cash dividends paid.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	As of August 31, 2013 , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	_______________ (1) This facility, which matures on October 31, 2016 , provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	The facility is subject to annual commitment fees.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S4	As of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no borrowings under the facility.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S5	(2) We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S6	These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S7	Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S8	As of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no borrowings under these facilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S9	(3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S10	As of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no borrowings under these various facilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S11	Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $179 million and $164 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P104_S12	In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $25.60 million and $0.03 million as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	As of August 31, 2013 , our aggregate available authorization was $1,964 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2013 was as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	_______________ (1) We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	(2) During fiscal 2013 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P106_S3	These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	(3) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2014 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2013 , we issued 11,019,187 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement ).
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S3	The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S4	Subsequent Developments On September 25, 2013 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.93 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 11, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S5	Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.93 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 8, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S6	Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM7_P109_S7	On September 25, 2013, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority bringing Accenture s total outstanding authority to approximately $6.96 billion.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2013 , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
1467373_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	_______________ (1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	(2) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	(3) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P112_S4	Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P112_S5	(4) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S3	Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S4	Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S5	Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S6	The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S7	For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S8	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P113_S9	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In August 2013, we early adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) which requires enhanced disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to present separately, by item, reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1467373_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	The early adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	For additional information related to the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	In September 2012, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change in the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, which are now presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income rather than in the Consolidated Shareholders Equity Statements, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any).
1467373_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P116_S4	We adopted this new guidance for our fiscal 2013 annual goodwill impairment test.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P116_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset, amounts offset and the related net exposure.
1467373_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	The new guidance will be effective for Accenture beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time we will include the required disclosures.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P0_S9	For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2013 , it was anticipated that $177 million of the net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $309 million and $402 million as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2013 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and iii.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S5	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S6	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1467373_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1467373_13_ITEM10_P0_S0	There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors from those described in the Proxy Statement for our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders filed with the SEC on December 17, 2012.

1467373_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	F-2 Consolidated Financial Statements as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 and for the years ended August 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Accenture plc : We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Shareholders Equity Statements, and Consolidated Cash Flows Statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S1	We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S2	Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P9_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P10_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P10_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1467373_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture plc seeks to deliver competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	Accenture plc s global delivery model enables it to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company ).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	Accenture plc s only business is to hold Class I common shares in, and to act as the sole general partner of, its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P18_S2	The Company operates its business through Accenture SCA and subsidiaries of Accenture SCA.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P18_S3	Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P18_S4	The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P18_S5	The noncontrolling interest percentages were 6% and 8% as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Company s fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	For example, a reference to fiscal 2013 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P20_S2	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Fiscal 2012 income tax amounts in certain line items within cash flows from operating activities in the Company s Consolidated Cash Flows Statement have been revised.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	These revisions were not material and had no impact on reported Net cash provided by operating activities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P22_S2	In addition, certain other amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2013 presentation.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	If the Company s estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	In such contracts, the Company s efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P29_S2	In such contracts, the Company s effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P29_S3	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P29_S4	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S4	Deferred transition costs were $539,048 and $538,638 as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S5	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S6	Deferred transition revenues were $515,578 and $551,364 as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues relating to contract costs.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P31_S7	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P32_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P32_S3	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P32_S4	VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Company s accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company s control.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) include the margin earned on computer hardware and software, as well as revenues from alliance agreements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P41_S2	The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P41_S3	Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P42_S3	Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds of $650,000 and $1,265,000 as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	Cash and cash equivalents also includes restricted cash of $45,132 and $27,982 as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which primarily relates to cash held to meet certain insurance requirements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash payables.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	As of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $91,716 and $64,874 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P45_S3	The allowance reflects the Company s best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P47_S2	Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than 90 days but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Investments with an original maturity greater than one year are considered to be long-term investments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	Marketable short-term and long-term investments are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale investments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	Quoted market prices are used to determine the fair values of common equity and debt securities that were issued by publicly traded entities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	Realized gains and losses on securities are determined based on the First In, First Out method and are included in Other (expense) income, net.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P49_S3	The Company does not hold these investments for speculative or trading purposes.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P51_S2	If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	_______________ (1) For additional information, see Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	In August 2013, the Company early adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) which requires enhanced disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to present separately, by item, reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	The early adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	For additional information related to the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	In September 2012, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB, which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change in the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, which are now presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income rather than in the Consolidated Shareholders Equity Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P56_S3	If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P56_S4	The Company adopted this new guidance for its fiscal 2013 annual goodwill impairment test.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P56_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	_______________ (1) Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture SCA Class I common shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	The income effect does not take into account Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests other, since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	(2) Fiscal 2012 and 2011 diluted weighted average Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2013 payment of cash dividends.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P58_S3	This did not result in a change to previously reported Diluted earnings per share.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	REORGANIZATION (BENEFITS) COSTS, NET In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	These included liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Company has recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities are probable.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	Interest accruals are made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company s reorganization activity was as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	As a result of final determinations, certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with the Company's transition to a corporate structure in 2001 are no longer probable.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	Accordingly, the Company recorded reorganization benefits of $273,945 during fiscal 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	These benefits were partially offset by interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities of $1,903 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P61_S3	As of August 31, 2013 , reorganization liabilities of $5,080 were included in Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months, and reorganization liabilities of $13,381 were included in Other non-current liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P61_S4	Final resolution, through settlement, conclusion of legal proceedings or a tax authority s decision not to pursue a claim, will result in payment by the Company of amounts in settlement or judgment of these matters and/or recording of a reorganization benefit or cost in the Company s Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	As of August 31, 2013 , only a small number of countries remain that have active audits/investigations or open statutes of limitations.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS The following table summarizes the changes in the accumulated balances for each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to Accenture plc:

1467373_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable operating segment were as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P73_S3	The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P73_S4	The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Company s derivative financial instruments, was approximately $4,805 as of August 31, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P74_S2	The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P74_S3	These provisions may reduce the Company s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P74_S4	Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P74_S5	Similarly, a decrement in the Company s credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August 31, 2013 was $418,697 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P76_S3	Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P76_S4	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P77_S3	As of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P78_S2	Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	The amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were a net loss of $49,954 and $55,068 during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a net gain of $21,753 during fiscal 2011.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 , was not material.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P81_S3	In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P81_S4	As of August 31, 2013 , $177,201 of net unrealized losses related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	Other Derivatives The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net loss of $142,432 and $153,913 for fiscal 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P82_S3	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	BORROWINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS As of August 31, 2013 , the Company had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:

1467373_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	_______________ (1) Final determinations include final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of enacted changes in tax laws and tax rates did not have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	The components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company recorded valuation allowances of $204,561 and $221,015 as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	During fiscal 2013 , the Company recorded a net decrease of $16,454 in the valuation allowance, primarily due to the realization of foreign tax credits.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S3	The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2013 of $724,484 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S4	Of this amount, $142,937 expires between 2014 and 2023 , $30,061 expires between 2024 and 2033 , and $551,486 has an indefinite carryforward period.

1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S6	As of August 31, 2013 , the Company had $1,263,070 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $647,208 , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S7	As of August 31, 2012 , the Company had $1,604,745 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $813,721 , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P92_S8	The differences of $615,862 and $791,024 , respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 , the Company recognized (benefit) expense of $(46,602) , $(98,765) and $59,950 in interest and penalties, respectively.

1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S3	The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2010 to 2011.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S4	The audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2006 to 2009 closed during fiscal 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S5	The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S6	Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S7	With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2006.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S8	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $732,000 or increase by approximately $112,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S9	The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S10	As of August 31, 2013 , the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $2,847,544 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S11	If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S12	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S13	Portions of the Company s operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal 2014 and 2017 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S14	Some of the holidays are renewable at reduced levels, with renewal periods through 2027 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P94_S15	The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately $84,000 , $84,000 and $72,000 in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined benefit retirement plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	In addition, the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	The defined benefit pension disclosures include the Company's U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

1467373_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	These costs are not material and are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P97_S2	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense for the subsequent year were as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S. Plans is to match the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P98_S2	The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P98_S3	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	Pension Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $91,771 , $102,555 and $110,332 respectively.

1467373_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	Funded Status for Defined Benefit Plans The accumulated benefit obligation as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	The following information is provided for defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and for plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 :
1467373_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Investment Strategies U.S. Pension Plans The overall investment objective of the plans is to provide growth in the defined benefit pension plans assets to help fund future defined benefit pension obligations while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Company s current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P105_S2	The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P105_S3	Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P105_S4	Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P106_S1	The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P106_S2	In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P110_S1	In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	Plan Assets The Company s target allocation for fiscal 2014 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2013 and 2012 by asset category, for defined benefit pension plans were as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

1467373_13_ITEM15_P439_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan) as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P439_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P439_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P439_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P439_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P440_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P440_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P440_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P440_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the changes in its financial status for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P441_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P442_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P443_S0	The following description of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ) is provided for general information purposes.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P443_S1	Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P444_S0	Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the VEIP ).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P445_S0	General Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company is authorized to issue or transfer up to 45,000,000 Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P446_S0	The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P446_S1	The Company pays all expenses of the Plan.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P446_S2	The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P447_S0	The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P447_S1	The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P448_S0	In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P448_S1	The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P448_S2	The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P449_S0	Contributions Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as is permitted by the Committee.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P449_S1	Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is 10% (up to a maximum of $7,500 per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P449_S2	Under the VEIP, eligible participants may choose to contribute up to 30% of their total compensation towards the purchase of Shares.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P449_S3	The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P449_S4	Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit based on a percentage of total eligible participant compensation as defined by the Plan and permitted by the Committee.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P449_S5	The aggregate participation limit percentage was 11% prior to July 25, 2012 at which time the Committee resolved to increase the percentage to 15%.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P449_S6	If aggregate compensation is projected to reach this cap, then contributions will stop and participants would be refunded contributions not used to purchase shares.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P450_S0	A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the applicable offering period as determined by the Committee.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P450_S1	Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P450_S2	All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account under the Plan and are deposited with the general funds of the Company.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P450_S3	All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P450_S4	Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal 2013 included the six-month periods ended November 1, 2012 and May 1, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P450_S5	The current offering period commenced on May 2, 2013 and will end on November 1, 2013 .
1467373_13_ITEM15_P451_S0	The VEIP has a calendar year offering period and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5 th of the subsequent month.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P452_S0	Share Purchases As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P452_S1	Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P452_S2	A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:
1467373_13_ITEM15_P453_S0	As of August 31, 2013 , 23,429,599 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares had been issued under the Plan.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P454_S0	Withdrawals Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_13_ITEM15_P454_S1	Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law).
1467373_13_ITEM15_P454_S2	A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal.

1467373_14_ITEM1_P51_S6	In addition, we spend a significant portion of our research and development investment directly through our operating groups and growth platforms to develop market-ready solutions for our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Employees Our most important asset is our people.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	One of our key goals is to have the best talent, with highly specialized skills, at the right levels in the right locations, to enhance our differentiation and competitiveness.

1467373_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Competition We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services competitive with those we offer.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:
1467373_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	global reach and scale, including level of presence in key emerging markets.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	We provide value to our clients based in part on a differentiated range of proprietary inventions, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	We recognize the increasing value of intellectual property in the marketplace and create, harvest, and protect this intellectual property.

1467373_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Organizational Structure Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than Class I common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares ( Accenture SCA ).
1467373_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA and Accenture plc s only business is to hold these shares.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	As the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plc s majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P57_S4	Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Accenture SCA Class I common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction ).
1467373_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	On December 1, 2012, we ceased using the designation senior executive.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	The majority of our leaders are now designated managing directors, and a select group of our most experienced leaders are senior managing directors.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P60_S4	Managing directors and senior managing directors, along with members of the Accenture global management committee (the Company s primary management and leadership team, which consists of 20 of our most senior leaders), comprise Accenture Leadership.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P60_S5	The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report reflect the ownership interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P60_S6	The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 6% as of August 31, 2014.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	As described above under History, Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture SCA Class I common shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S4	Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S5	A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S6	Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S7	Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares Only Accenture and the current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA Class I common shares.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S8	Each Class I common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P62_S9	As of October 14, 2014, Accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 95% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 5% of the voting interest held by the current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCA s articles of association.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	Under Accenture SCA s articles of association, the market value of a Class I common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i) the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the Class A ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii) if Accenture plc sells its Class A ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the Class A ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	Except in the case of a redemption of Class I common shares or a transfer of Class I common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCA s articles of association provide that Accenture SCA Class I common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA Class I common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture SCA Class I common shares in the tender offer).
1467373_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.
1467373_14_ITEM1_P65_S3	The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture SCA.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in North America and Europe.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Weak demand or a slower than expected recovery in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	In addition, because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of North America and Europe, an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S12	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S13	In addition, as new technologies become available, such as Software as a Service (SaaS), which continually change the nature of our business, clients may slow spending on current technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Such a slowdown can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S15	Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P1_S16	If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	At any given time in a particular industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry and/or geography.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, or delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S7	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S10	We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S11	For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S12	As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S13	Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S14	We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S15	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S16	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S17	Our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S18	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S19	If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S20	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P5_S21	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed, particularly in emerging markets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	There is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S6	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S7	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S9	For example, there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S12	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S13	We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S14	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S15	As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies and social media, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P10_S16	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing, digital, the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data and SaaS solutions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of SaaS solutions, could affect the nature of how our revenue is generated.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S6	These technologies, and others that may emerge, could reduce and, over time, replace some of our current business.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S7	In addition, clients may delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and may delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate the new technologies.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S9	If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S10	In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S11	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S12	Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S13	If we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P13_S14	The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business, due to factors such as the use of alternative pricing, the mix of work and the number of service providers, among others.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	For example, in projects involving our SaaS solutions, revenue is typically generated on a usage basis, which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale projects or enterprises.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our currency hedging program, which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, such as the Indian rupee, could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S9	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S10	These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S11	We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S12	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S13	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S14	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S15	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S16	We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our workforce to lower-cost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P20_S17	These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Over time, we have been successful in managing our general and administrative costs.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs, it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, we may not be able to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth, we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S9	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S10	If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S11	In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P22_S12	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P25_S6	As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., Congressional sequestration of funds under the Budget Control Act of 2011) or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the United States and Europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect Accenture.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S7	We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P34_S10	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities, any of which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	By their nature, joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself, particularly when we have a minority position.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisition and joint ventures for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S5	For example, natural disasters of the type described above, some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Additionally, both India and the Philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability and worker strikes.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S7	India in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including Pakistan.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully above, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S10	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P38_S11	Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P39_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	For example, a number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 56 countries around the world.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Our growth strategy might not be successful.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S7	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S8	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S9	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S10	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S11	Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S12	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S13	These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S14	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S15	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S16	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S17	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S18	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S19	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S20	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S21	The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S22	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S23	Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P42_S24	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our employees, subcontractors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliance partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which could lessen related demand for our services.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S6	We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S7	These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S4	The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S7	Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S8	In addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S9	If we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S10	Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S11	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S12	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S13	Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S14	We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P47_S15	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P49_S4	There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P51_S4	These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P51_S5	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S4	We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate, and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S6	We might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S8	This could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S9	In addition, in certain geographies and industries, some clients have requested longer payment terms, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our cash flows.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S10	Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S11	If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S12	In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S13	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S14	As of August 31, 2014, we had more than 305,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S15	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S16	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S17	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S18	The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S19	For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S20	Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P52_S21	If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	projections or speculation about our business or that of competitors by the media or investment analysts.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	global, regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	As a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, our share price could be difficult to predict, and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P56_S4	We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P58_S4	These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P58_S5	If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P60_S4	We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P60_S5	The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2013 of Ireland (the Companies Acts ).
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P64_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company s authorized but unissued share capital.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1467373_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability.
1467373_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

1467373_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations for Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, net and Provision for Income Taxes, respectively.
1467373_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	_______________ (1) In early fiscal 2010, we announced a move to declare and pay cash dividends on a semi-annual basis.
1467373_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	During fiscal 2010, we paid a final annual cash dividend of $0.75 in addition to a transitional semi-annual cash dividend of $0.375.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	We use the terms Accenture, we, the Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	For example, a reference to fiscal 2014 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	There continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets around the world, as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide, all of which may impact our business.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $7.78 billion , compared with $7.09 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Net revenues for fiscal 2014 were $30.00 billion , compared with $28.56 billion for fiscal 2013 , an increase of 5% in both U.S. dollars and local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Communications, Media Technology, Products, Health Public Service and Financial Services experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while Resources was flat year-over-year in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	Clients continue to request a higher volume of outsourcing services, place a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and manage the pace and level of spending on existing consulting and outsourcing contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The business environment remains competitive and, in the first half of fiscal 2014, we experienced pricing pressures.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We use the term pricing to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $4.02 billion , compared with $3.80 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2014 were $15.74 billion , compared with $15.38 billion for fiscal 2013 , an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	Clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	We continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including digital services (digital marketing, analytics and mobility) and cloud computing.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S5	Compared to fiscal 2013, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S6	This trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue, and we expect this trend to continue.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S7	In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $3.76 billion , compared with $3.28 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S8	Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2014 were $14.26 billion , compared with $13.18 billion for fiscal 2013 , an increase of 8% in both U.S. dollars and local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S9	Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S10	Compared to fiscal 2013, we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S11	As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S12	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P5_S13	If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	When compared to fiscal 2013 , there was no aggregate foreign currency translation impact during fiscal 2014 , resulting in U.S. dollar revenue growth that was the same as our revenue growth in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on chargeable work.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was approximately 88% , flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and within our target range.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S6	We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S7	We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S8	Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to more than 305,000 as of August 31, 2014 , compared with approximately 293,000 as of May 31, 2014 and approximately 275,000 as of August 31, 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S9	The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, primarily those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S10	Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 15% , up from 14% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and 12% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S11	We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S12	In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S13	For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2014 became effective September 1, 2013.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S14	We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P7_S15	Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing and emerging technology services; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 31.7% , compared with 33.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Gross margin for fiscal 2014 was 32.3% , compared with 32.9% for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	There were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	We experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases and/or rebalance the mix of resources.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	In addition, we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	While we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014, the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S4	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 , compared with 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S5	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.0% for fiscal 2014 , compared with 18.6% for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S6	Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business-development activities; investment in offerings; marketing-and advertising-related activities; and acquisition-related costs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S7	General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S8	We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S9	For fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 , sales and marketing and general and administrative costs each decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S10	Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1,079 million , compared with $984 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S11	Operating income for fiscal 2014 was $4,301 million , compared with $4,339 million for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S12	Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 13.9% , flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S13	Operating margin for fiscal 2014 was 14.3% , compared with 15.2% for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S14	We recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million during fiscal 2013 which increased operating margin by 100 basis points.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S15	Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2013 would have been 14.2% .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S16	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 26.1% , compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S17	The above noted reorganization benefits recorded during fiscal 2013 increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S18	In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S19	Absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3% .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S20	Diluted earnings per share were $4.52 for fiscal 2014 , compared with $4.93 for fiscal 2013 , which included $0.72 in benefits from final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities and reductions in reorganization liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P9_S21	Excluding these benefits, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2013 would have been $4.21.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	We seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 8 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Bookings and Backlog New bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $8.33 billion , with consulting bookings of $3.95 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.38 billion .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	New bookings for fiscal 2014 were $35.88 billion , with consulting bookings of $17.15 billion and outsourcing bookings of $18.73 billion .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The types of services clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	New bookings involve estimates and judgments.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining third party evidence of fair value of each element and is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P39_S5	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P39_S6	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media Technology; Financial Services; Health Public Service; Products; and Resources.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P43_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	_______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	(1) EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Communications, Media Technology net revenues increased 5% in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	Outsourcing revenue growth was driven by all industry groups in Americas and Electronics High Tech in Asia Pacific.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics High Tech in EMEA.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, led by Electronics High Tech in Americas and EMEA, partially offset by declines in Communications across all geographic regions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Financial Services net revenues increased 5% in local currency.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Products net revenues increased 8% in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions in most industry groups, led by Air, Freight Travel Services and Life Sciences in Americas and Retail in EMEA.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	These increases were partially offset by declines in Retail in Americas, and Consumer Goods Services and Air, Freight Travel Services in EMEA.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, driven by most industry groups in EMEA, led by Retail, Consumer Goods Services and Auto, and in Americas, led by Consumer Goods Services and Air, Freight Travel Services.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	This growth was partially offset by declines in Retail in Asia Pacific and Americas.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	Outsourcing revenues reflected modest growth, driven by Energy in Americas and Utilities in EMEA, partially offset by a decline in Utilities in Americas.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Natural Resources across all geographic regions and Energy in Americas, partially offset by growth in Energy in Asia Pacific and EMEA, Utilities in EMEA and Chemicals in Americas.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	Some of our clients, primarily in Natural Resources, continued to reduce their level of consulting investments.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	In addition, several large systems integration projects have ended or have transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our services has moderated.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P53_S5	We expect these trends will continue to impact Resources year-over-year net revenue growth in the near term.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Americas net revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by the United States, partially offset by a decline in Canada.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	EMEA net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany and Norway.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	These increases were partially offset by declines in Spain, South Africa and Finland.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Asia Pacific net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by Japan and to a lesser extent India, partially offset by declines in Singapore and South Korea.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	In fiscal 2015, we will begin reporting our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada); Europe; and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey).
1467373_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	See Item 9B, Other Information for fiscal 2014 and 2013 net revenues aligned with these revised geographic regions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $27,574 million , an increase of $1,519 million , or 6% , over fiscal 2013 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 86.5% from 85.7% during this period.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P57_S4	Operating expenses for fiscal 2013 included reorganization benefits of $274 million as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P57_S5	Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2014 was $22,190 million , an increase of $1,180 million , or 6% , over fiscal 2013 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.6% from 69.1% during this period.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	There were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	We experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases and/or rebalance the mix of resources.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	In addition, we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	While we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014, the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 was $3,583 million , an increase of $101 million , or 3% , over fiscal 2013 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.2% during this period.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	During fiscal 2013 , we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million , which increased operating margin by 100 basis points.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Excluding the effects of the fiscal 2013 reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2014 increased 10 basis points compared to fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	(2) We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding reorganization benefits, as we believe the effect of the reorganization benefits on Operating income and operating margin facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these benefits and our operating performance.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	During fiscal 2014 , the financial results of each operating group benefited from a reduction in variable compensation compared to fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The commentary below provides additional insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, exclusive of the reorganization benefit recorded in fiscal 2013:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Communications, Media Technology operating income was impacted by lower contract profitability, including early-stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	Operating income was favorably impacted by revenue growth.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Financial Services operating income was impacted by lower contract profitability, including early-stage work at lower margins on a few large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Operating income was favorably impacted by outsourcing revenue growth.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Health Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Products operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability, including delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Operating income was favorably impacted by revenue growth.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Resources operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Operating income was favorably impacted by higher outsourcing contract profitability.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 26.1% , compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	During fiscal 2013 , we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million , which increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	Absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3% .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	The higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2014 is primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2014 was $234 million , a decrease of $38 million , or 14% , from fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S4	The decrease was due to lower Net income of $379 million and a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 6% for fiscal 2014 from 7% for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S5	Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $4.52 for fiscal 2014 , compared with $4.93 for fiscal 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S6	The $0.41 decrease in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of $274 million , which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.38 , and the $243 million tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.34 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S7	Excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased $0.31 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2013 , due to increases of $0.25 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.12 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P71_S8	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.06 from a higher effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth, driven by growth in Americas across all industry groups and Media Entertainment in EMEA, partially offset by a significant decline in Electronics High Tech in EMEA, principally due to an expected year-over-year revenue decline from one contract.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	In addition, outsourcing revenue growth was impacted by a decline in Electronics High Tech in Asia Pacific.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P77_S3	Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, due to declines in Communications and Media Entertainment in Americas and Electronics High Tech in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by strong growth in Electronics High Tech in Americas.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	Changes in the banking and capital markets industries continued to influence the business needs of our clients.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P78_S5	This resulted in higher demand for outsourcing services, including transformational projects, and lower demand for short-term consulting services.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	Some of our clients, primarily in Natural Resources and Utilities, reduced their level of consulting investments.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P82_S4	In addition, several large systems integration projects ended or transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our outsourcing services moderated.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P86_S7	The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities, as well as acquisition-related costs.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	(2) We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding reorganization benefits, as we believe quantifying the effect of the reorganization benefits on Operating income and operating margin facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these benefits and our operating performance.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	During fiscal 2013, each operating group recorded a portion of the $274 million reorganization benefits.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2013, exclusive of the reorganization benefits, compared with fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Communications, Media Technology operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Operating income was also impacted by an expected significant year-over-year revenue decline from one outsourcing contract.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Financial Services operating income increased, primarily due to strong outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing and consulting contract profitability.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2012 included the impact of costs related to acquisitions.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Health Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract profitability.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Resources operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Interest Income Interest income for fiscal 2013 was $33 million, a decrease of $10 million, or 23%, from fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	The decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Other (Expense) Income, net Other (expense) income, net for fiscal 2013 was $18 million, a decrease of $23 million from fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S4	The change was primarily driven by net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2013, compared to net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S5	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 18.1%, compared with 27.6% for fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S6	During fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased income before taxes without any increase in income tax expense.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S7	The effective tax rate was also impacted by a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 recorded during fiscal 2013.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P96_S8	Absent these items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%, which is lower than fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower additions to tax reserves.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S3	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2013 was $273 million, an increase of $1 million over fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S4	The increase was due to higher Net income of $730 million, offset by a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 7% for fiscal 2013 from 9% for fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S5	Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $4.93 for fiscal 2013, compared with $3.84 for fiscal 2012.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S6	The $1.09 increase in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased earnings per share by $0.38, and the $243 million tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share by $0.34.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S7	Excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share increased $0.37 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2012, due to increases of $0.19 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.13 from a lower effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits, and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S8	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 from lower non-operating income.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P97_S9	For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	As of August 31, 2014 , Cash and cash equivalents was $4.9 billion , compared with $5.6 billion as of August 31, 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	Operating activities: The year-over-year improvement in operating cash flow was primarily due to a discretionary cash contribution of $500 million made to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2013, which had a net impact of $350 million, after tax.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	This increase was partially offset by lower collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues) and higher current year operational spending.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	Investing activities: The $100 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	Financing activities: The $100 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	For additional information, see Note 14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	As of August 31, 2014 , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	_______________ (1) This facility, which matures on October 31, 2016 , provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S5	(2) We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S6	These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S7	Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S8	As of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no borrowings under these facilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S9	(3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S10	As of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no borrowings under these various facilities.

1467373_14_ITEM7_P106_S12	In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $27 million and $26 million as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	As of August 31, 2014 , our aggregate available authorization was $4,746 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2014 was as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	(1) We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	(2) During fiscal 2014 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P109_S3	These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2015 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2014 , we issued 1,242,209 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement ).
1467373_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P111_S4	On September 23, 2014 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 17, 2014 .

1467373_14_ITEM7_P111_S6	Both dividends are payable on November 17, 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2014 , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
1467373_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	(1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	(2) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P115_S3	(3) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P115_S4	Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S3	Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S4	Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S5	Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S6	The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S7	For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S8	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P116_S9	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	In September 2013, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), which requires enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	The guidance also requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset, amounts of offset and the related net exposure.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	For additional information related to master netting arrangements, see Note 8 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	New Accounting Pronouncement On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P120_S2	The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption.
1467373_14_ITEM7_P120_S3	We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound and U.S. dollar/Swiss franc are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P0_S9	For additional information, see Note 8 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2014 , it was anticipated that $20 million of the net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $259 million and $309 million as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2014 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and iii.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S5	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S6	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992).
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page F-2.
1467373_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1467373_14_ITEM9B_P0_S0	On October 22, 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved an amendment to outstanding time-vesting equity awards previously granted under the Senior Officer Performance Equity Award program to members of the Company s global management committee.
1467373_14_ITEM9B_P0_S1	Pursuant to the amended terms of such awards, if a global management committee member who is eligible for age-based vesting retires on or after the fiscal year-end (August 31st) but before the following January 1st, Accenture will allow for the vesting of awards that would otherwise have vested on January 1st had such global management committee member not retired before that date.
1467373_14_ITEM9B_P0_S2	In addition, the Compensation Committee determined that qualifying members of the global management committee who retire on or after the fiscal year-end but before the following February 1st will receive a cash payment in recognition of their prior fiscal year performance rather than receiving restricted share units under time-vesting equity award programs, which they would have received had they not retired before that date.
1467373_14_ITEM9B_P0_S3	In connection with the previously announced retirement of Martin I. Cole, the Company s former group chief executive Technology, the Compensation Committee determined that in lieu of the time-vesting awards of restricted share units that would have been granted to Mr. Cole for his performance in fiscal 2014, Mr. Cole will instead receive an equivalent amount of cash in the amount of $780,000.
1467373_14_ITEM9B_P1_S0	In fiscal 2015, we will begin reporting our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada); Europe; and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey).
1467373_14_ITEM9B_P1_S1	Fiscal 2014 and 2013 net revenues aligned with these revised geographic regions are as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM9B_P2_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_14_ITEM10_P0_S0	There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors from those described in the Proxy Statement for our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders filed with the SEC on December 16, 2013.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	F-2 Consolidated Financial Statements as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 and for the years ended August 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Accenture plc : We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2014.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S1	We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S2	Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P9_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P10_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P10_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P11_S1	Also in our opinion, Accenture plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Accenture plc is one of the world s leading organizations providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P17_S1	Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture plc seeks to deliver competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P17_S2	Accenture plc s global delivery model enables it to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company ).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	Accenture plc s only business is to hold Class I common shares in, and to act as the sole general partner of, its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P18_S2	The Company operates its business through Accenture SCA and subsidiaries of Accenture SCA.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P18_S3	Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P18_S4	The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P18_S5	The noncontrolling interest percentages were 6% as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Company s fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	For example, a reference to fiscal 2014 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P20_S2	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P23_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P23_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	If the Company s estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	In such contracts, the Company s efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P25_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P25_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P27_S2	In such contracts, the Company s effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P27_S3	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P27_S4	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P29_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P29_S4	Deferred transition costs were $598,317 and $539,048 as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple elements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining third party evidence of fair value of each element and is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Company s accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company s control.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P32_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P39_S3	Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P40_S3	Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P43_S2	As of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $82,643 and $91,716 , respectively.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P43_S3	The allowance reflects the Company s best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P45_S2	Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Non-current investments are primarily non-marketable equity securities of privately held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or cost methods of accounting, in accordance with the requirements of ASC 323, Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale investments and reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P47_S2	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of net assets acquired.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company reviews the recoverability of goodwill by reportable operating segment annually, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P49_S2	Based on the results of its annual impairment analysis, the Company determined that no impairment existed as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , as each reportable operating segment s estimated fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including deferred contract costs and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	In September 2013, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), which requires enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	The guidance also requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset, amounts of offset and the related net exposure.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P52_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P52_S3	For additional information related to master netting arrangements, see Note 8 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	New Accounting Pronouncement On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P54_S2	The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in its fiscal year 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P54_S3	The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	_______________ (1) Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture SCA Class I common shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	The income effect does not take into account Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests other, since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	(2) Fiscal 2013 and 2012 diluted weighted average Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2014 payment of cash dividends.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P56_S3	This did not result in a change to previously reported Diluted earnings per share.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	REORGANIZATION (BENEFITS) COSTS, NET In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	These included liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities were probable.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P57_S3	Interest accruals were made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company s reorganization activity was as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	As a result of final determinations during fiscal 2014 and 2013, these reorganization liabilities were no longer probable.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	Accordingly, the Company recorded reorganization benefits of $18,531 and $273,945 , respectively, in its Consolidated Income Statements associated with releasing these liabilities, resulting in no remaining reorganization liabilities as of August 31, 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS The following table summarizes the changes in the accumulated balances for each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to Accenture plc:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	_______________ (1) Reclassifications into net periodic pension and post-retirement expense are recognized in Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The components of Property and equipment, net were as follows:

1467373_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P74_S3	The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P74_S4	The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Company s derivative financial instruments, was $59,099 as of August 31, 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P75_S2	The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P75_S3	These provisions may reduce the Company s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P75_S4	Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P75_S5	Similarly, a decrement in the Company s credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August 31, 2014 was $80,969 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P77_S2	All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P77_S3	Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P77_S4	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 11 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P78_S2	The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P78_S3	As of August 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P79_S2	Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P94_S2	During fiscal 2014 , the Company recorded a net increase of $169,973 in the valuation allowance.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P94_S3	The majority of this change related to valuation allowances on tax credit carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P94_S4	The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2014 of $750,124 .

1467373_14_ITEM15_P94_S9	The differences of $690,129 and $615,862 , respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P96_S5	Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P96_S6	With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2006.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P96_S7	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $770,000 or increase by approximately $111,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P96_S8	The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P96_S9	As of August 31, 2014 , the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $3,403,042 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	The defined benefit pension disclosures include the Company s U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P99_S1	These costs are not material and are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P99_S2	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense for the subsequent year were as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S. Plans is to match the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P100_S2	The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P100_S3	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Pension Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $87,422 , $91,771 and $102,555 , respectively.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	The changes in the defined benefit pension obligations, plan assets and funded status for fiscal 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	The pre-tax accumulated net actuarial loss and prior service credit recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	The estimated amounts that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2014 into net periodic pension expense during fiscal 2015 are as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	Funded Status for Defined Benefit Plans The accumulated benefit obligation as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	The following information is provided for defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and for plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1467373_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	Investment Strategies U.S. Pension Plans The overall investment objective of the plans is to provide growth in the defined benefit pension plans assets to help fund future defined benefit pension obligations while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P107_S1	The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Company s current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P107_S2	The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P107_S3	Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P107_S4	Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P109_S1	Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P110_S1	Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P114_S2	Plan Assets The Company s target allocation for fiscal 2015 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2014 and 2013 by asset category, for defined benefit pension plans were as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P116_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P116_S2	The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	The fair values of defined benefit pension plan assets as of August 31, 2014 were as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during fiscal 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	Expected Contributions Generally, annual contributions are made at such times and in amounts as required by law and may, from time to time, exceed minimum funding requirements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	The Company estimates it will pay approximately $63,312 in fiscal 2015 related to contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and benefit payments related to the unfunded frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P120_S2	The Company has not determined whether it will make additional voluntary contributions for its defined benefit pension plans.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P144_S8	For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P144_S9	To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P144_S10	The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.

1467373_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan) as of August 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2014.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P180_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P180_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P180_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P180_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P181_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P181_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P181_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan as of August 31, 2014 and 2013, and the changes in its financial status for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	The following description of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ) is provided for general information purposes.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P184_S1	Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the VEIP ).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	General Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company is authorized to issue or transfer up to 45,000,000 Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P187_S1	The Company pays all expenses of the Plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P187_S2	The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P188_S1	The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P189_S0	In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P189_S1	The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P189_S2	The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P190_S0	Contributions Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as is permitted by the Committee.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P190_S1	Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is 10% (up to a maximum of $7,500 per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P190_S2	Under the VEIP, eligible participants may choose to contribute up to 30% of their compensation towards the purchase of Shares.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P190_S3	The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P190_S4	Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit based on a percentage of total eligible participant compensation as defined by the Plan and permitted by the Committee.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P190_S5	The aggregate participation limit percentage was 11% prior to July 25, 2012 at which time the Committee resolved to increase the percentage to 15%.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P190_S6	If aggregate compensation is projected to reach this cap, then contributions will stop and participants would be refunded contributions not used to purchase shares.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P191_S0	A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the applicable offering period as determined by the Committee.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P191_S1	Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P191_S2	All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account under the Plan and are deposited with the general funds of the Company.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P191_S3	All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P191_S4	Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal 2014 included the six-month periods ended November 1, 2013 and May 1, 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P191_S5	The current offering period commenced on May 2, 2014 and will end on November 1, 2014 .
1467373_14_ITEM15_P192_S0	The VEIP has a calendar year offering period and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5 th of the subsequent month.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P193_S0	Share Purchases As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P193_S1	Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P193_S2	A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:
1467373_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	As of August 31, 2014 , 30,497,431 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares had been issued under the Plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	Withdrawals Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P195_S1	Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law).
1467373_14_ITEM15_P195_S2	A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P195_S3	A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P196_S0	The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan (or pursuant to outstanding awards) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any option as of the date of consummation of the change in control.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P198_S0	Plan Amendment and Termination The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan, or without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P198_S1	The Plan will terminate upon the earliest of: (1) the termination of the Plan by the Board; (2) the issuance of all of the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan; or (3) the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P198_S2	The Board has not initiated actions to terminate the Plan, and unless otherwise noted, has not amended the Plan.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P199_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Plan s management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the accompanying financial statements and disclosures.
1467373_14_ITEM15_P200_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.

1467373_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.

1467373_15_ITEM1_P56_S5	In addition, all holders of ordinary shares (except Accenture plc) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture Holdings plc or transferred to Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture Holdings plc determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law or regulation, or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture Holdings plc or its affiliates for Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, ordinary shares, until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares in the tender offer).

1467373_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions.

1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Weak demand in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	In addition, because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of North America and Europe, an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, as new technologies become available, such as digital-related offerings, Everything as a Service (EaaS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which continually change the nature of our business, clients may slow spending on current technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Such a slowdown can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	At any given time in a particular industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry and/or geography.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, or delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S9	Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S10	We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S11	For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S12	As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S13	Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S14	We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively manage our current contracts and client relationships could be jeopardized.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S15	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S16	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S17	Our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S18	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S19	If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our profitability could suffer.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S20	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P4_S21	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Additionally, if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S7	In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S8	If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S9	The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P7_S10	The markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S9	For example, there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P8_S12	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies and social media, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Examples of areas of significant change include digital, analytics, mobility, IoT, cloud-based services, as-a-service solutions, security, cognitive computing and information technology automation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of EaaS solutions, could affect the nature of how our revenue is generated.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	These technologies, and others that may emerge, could reduce and, over time, replace some of our current business.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	In addition, clients may delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and may delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate the new technologies.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S10	If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S11	In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S12	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S13	Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S14	If we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P11_S15	The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In addition, our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business, due to factors such as the use of alternative pricing, the mix of work and the number of service providers, among others.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For example, in client engagements involving our EaaS solutions, revenue is typically generated on a usage basis, which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S7	If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Our cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P18_S7	This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our workforce to lower-cost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P19_S9	These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Over time, we have been successful in managing our general and administrative costs.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs, it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, we may not be able to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth, we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S10	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S11	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S12	If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S13	In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P20_S14	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P24_S6	As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., Congressional sequestration of funds under the Budget Control Act of 2011) or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the United States and Europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	the future or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect Accenture.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S6	We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S7	We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S10	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P33_S11	Acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, retention payments, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	By their nature, joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself, particularly when we have a minority position.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions and joint ventures for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We periodically evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Additionally, both India and the Philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability and worker strikes.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	India in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including Pakistan.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully below, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P42_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	For example, a number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S7	In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P43_S8	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 55 countries around the world.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our growth strategy might not be successful.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S7	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S8	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S9	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S10	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S11	Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P44_S12	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S5	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S7	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S8	The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S9	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S10	Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P45_S11	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S7	In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliance partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition, our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S6	We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P48_S7	These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S4	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S9	In addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S10	If we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S11	Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S12	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S13	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S14	Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S15	We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P49_S16	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S6	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, cybersecurity breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S8	There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S10	Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S11	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S12	As of August 31, 2015, we had more than 358,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S13	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S14	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S15	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S16	The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S17	For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P50_S18	Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S6	These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P51_S7	If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P53_S4	These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P53_S5	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate, and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S6	We might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S8	This could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S9	In addition, in certain geographies and industries, some clients have requested longer payment terms, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our cash flows.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S10	Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S11	If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S12	In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S13	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S14	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P54_S15	We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P57_S4	We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P57_S5	The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P61_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company s authorized but unissued share capital.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P62_S3	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P62_S4	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P62_S5	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1467373_15_ITEM4_P0_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Our executive officers and persons chosen to become executive officers as of the date hereof are as follows: Gianfranco Casati , 56, became our group chief executive Growth Markets in January 2014.

1467373_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	There continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets around the world, which may impact our business.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.

1467373_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and we expect will continue to have a material effect on our financial results.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .

1467373_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	All of our operating groups experienced quarterly year-over-year revenue growth in local currency.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable and we saw improvement in certain areas of our business.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	We use the term pricing to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We continue to experience growing demand for digital-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Compared to fiscal 2014, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	This trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue in our systems integration business, and we expect this trend to continue.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 9% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .

1467373_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P7_S6	When compared to the same periods in fiscal 2014 , the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against many currencies during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 , resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 10% and 7.5% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Effective September 1, 2014, we updated the methodology we use to calculate utilization to include all billable employees time spent on chargeable work.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 90% , flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2015 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S5	We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S6	Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to more than 358,000 as of August 31, 2015 , compared to more than 336,000 as of May 31, 2015 and more than 305,000 as of August 31, 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S7	The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, primarily those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P9_S8	Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 14% , down from 15% in both the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 31.7% , flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Gross margin for fiscal 2015 was 31.6% , compared with 32.3% for fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The reduction in gross margin for fiscal 2015 was principally due to higher labor costs, increased usage of subcontractors and higher non-payroll costs including recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of employees compared to fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 , flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.1% for fiscal 2015 , compared with 18.0% for fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	For fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 , sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 60 basis points principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S7	General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 30 basis points.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S8	Operating expenses in fiscal 2015 included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $64 million related to lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P11_S9	For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 13.9% , flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 14.3% , flat with fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	The pension settlement charge of $64 million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased operating margin by 20 basis points for fiscal 2015 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin would have been 14.5% for fiscal 2015 , an increase of 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 25.8% , compared with 26.1% for fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Absent the tax impact of the $64 million pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 , our effective tax rate would have been 26.0% for fiscal 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for fiscal 2015 , compared with $4.52 for fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.06 in fiscal 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.82 for fiscal 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	We have also presented Operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the non-cash pension settlement charge, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of this charge and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our Operating income and Earnings per share are affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

1467373_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	New bookings for fiscal 2015 were $34.36 billion , with consulting bookings of $16.70 billion and outsourcing bookings of $17.66 billion .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	New bookings involve estimates and judgments.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	During fiscal 2015, the Company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested and recorded a tax liability of $247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S7	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P44_S8	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media Technology; Financial Services; Health Public Service; Products; and Resources.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S5	Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S6	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S7	Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P48_S8	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P49_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	_______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	(1) Effective September 1, 2014, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada); Europe; and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey).
1467373_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

1467373_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $904 million , or 3% , over fiscal 2014 , and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 86.5% , compared with fiscal 2014.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $910 million , or 4% , over fiscal 2014 , and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 85.7% , compared with fiscal 2014.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2015 increased $915 million , or 4% , over fiscal 2014 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.2% from 69.6% during this period.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P64_S4	Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $921 million , or 5% , over fiscal 2014 , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.4% from 67.7% during this period.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P64_S5	Gross margin for fiscal 2015 decreased to 31.6% from 32.3% during this period, principally due to higher labor costs, increased usage of subcontractors and higher non-payroll costs including recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of employees compared to fiscal 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P64_S6	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 decreased $78 million , or 2% , from fiscal 2014 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.3% from 11.9% during this period.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P64_S7	The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2015 decreased $15 million , or 1% , from fiscal 2014 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.8% from 6.1% during this period.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of $64 million, pre-tax, during fiscal 2015 as a result of lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments.

1467373_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2015 , we issued 6,240,119 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares (or, prior to August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA Class I common shares) pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement ).
1467373_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P117_S2	Subsequent Developments On September 21, 2015 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.10 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 16, 2015 .

1467373_15_ITEM7_P117_S4	Both dividends are payable on November 13, 2015 .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P117_S5	On September 21, 2015 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5,000 million in additional share repurchase authority, bringing Accenture s total outstanding authority to approximately $7,581 million .
1467373_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2015 , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
1467373_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	(1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	(2) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P121_S2	These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P121_S3	(3) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P121_S4	Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P122_S2	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	New Accounting Pronouncement On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P124_S2	The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption.
1467373_15_ITEM7_P124_S3	We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real and U.S. dollar/U.K. pound are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P0_S9	For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2015 , it was anticipated that approximately $20 million of net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $305 million and $259 million as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2015 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and iii.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S5	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S6	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
1467373_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Accenture plc : We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S1	We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S2	Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P7_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P8_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P8_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P9_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1467373_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Accenture plc is one of the world s leading organizations providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture plc seeks to deliver competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P15_S2	Accenture plc s global delivery model enables it to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company ).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P16_S1	Accenture plc s only business is to hold ordinary and deferred shares in, and to act as the controlling shareholder of, its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P16_S2	The Company operates its business through Accenture Holdings plc and subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P16_S3	Accenture plc controls Accenture Holdings plc s management and operations and consolidates Accenture Holdings plc s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	On June 26, 2015, the shareholders of Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares and direct subsidiary of Accenture plc, approved a merger of Accenture SCA with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity (the Merger ).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Merger, which was completed on August 26, 2015, further consolidated the Accenture group in Ireland.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P17_S2	In connection with the Merger, Accenture SCA was dissolved without going into liquidation, and, by operation of law, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture SCA were transferred to Accenture Holdings plc, and contracts, agreements or instruments to which Accenture SCA was a party were construed and have effect as if Accenture Holdings plc had been a party thereto instead of Accenture SCA.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P17_S3	Holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares (other than Accenture SCA itself) received, on a one-for-one basis, ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	Prior to the Merger, Accenture Holdings plc had not engaged in any business or other activities other than in connection with its formation and the Merger.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	The Merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P18_S2	All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	The shares of Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	The noncontrolling interest percentages were 5% and 6% as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Company s fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	For example, a reference to fiscal 2015 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2015 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P21_S2	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.

1467373_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August 31, 2015 was $129,291 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P79_S3	Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P79_S4	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P80_S2	The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P80_S3	As of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P82_S1	The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were a net gain of $15,207 during fiscal 2015 , and a net loss of $101,026 and $49,954 during fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 , was not material.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P84_S3	In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	Other Derivatives The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P85_S2	Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net loss of $257,783 , a net gain of $78,446 and a net loss of $142,432 for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P85_S3	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Company records derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	BORROWINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS As of August 31, 2015 , the Company had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	_______________ (1) This facility, which matures on October 31, 2016 , provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	The Company continues to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S3	The facility is subject to annual commitment fees.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S4	As of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had no borrowings under the facility.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S5	(2) The Company maintains separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S6	These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of the Company s operations.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S7	Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S8	As of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had no borrowings under these facilities.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S9	(3) The Company also maintains local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access the Company s global facilities.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S10	As of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had no borrowings under these various facilities.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S11	Under the borrowing facilities described above, the Company had an aggregate of $166,506 and $169,510 of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P90_S12	In addition, the Company had total outstanding debt of $27,435 and $26,733 as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	The components of Income before income taxes were as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company s effective income tax rate was as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	_______________ (1) Final determinations include final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	During fiscal 2015 , the Company concluded that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries would no longer be considered permanently reinvested and recorded an estimated tax liability of $247,097 for withholding taxes payable on the distribution of these earnings.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	These earnings were distributed in the form of a U.S. dividend declared and paid on August 26, 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P94_S2	The Company intends to permanently reinvest any future U.S. earnings.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P94_S3	As of August 31, 2015 , the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $538,384 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P94_S4	If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P94_S5	The unrecognized deferred tax liability (the amount payable if distributed) is approximately $66,000 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P94_S6	Portions of the Company s operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal 2016 and 2020 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately $111,000 , $91,000 and $84,000 in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of enacted changes in tax laws and tax rates did not have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	The components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company recorded valuation allowances of $1,229,146 and $374,534 as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax credit and tax net operating loss carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S1	For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S2	During fiscal 2015 , the Company recorded a net increase of $854,612 in the valuation allowance.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S3	The majority of this change related to valuation allowances on the increase in tax credit carryforwards, primarily foreign tax credits created by the U.S. dividend, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S4	The Company had tax credit carryforwards as of August 31, 2015 of $1,179,988 , of which $34,968 will expire between 2016 and 2025 , $1,046 will expire between 2026 and 2035 , and $1,143,974 has an indefinite carryforward period.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S5	The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2015 of $461,151 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S6	Of this amount, $167,425 expires between 2016 and 2025 , $3,131 expires between 2026 and 2035 , and $290,595 has an indefinite carryforward period.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S7	As of August 31, 2015 , the Company had $997,935 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $534,929 , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S8	As of August 31, 2014 , the Company had $1,333,606 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $643,477 , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P97_S9	The remaining unrecognized benefits as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 of $463,006 and $690,129 , respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 , the Company recognized (benefit) expense of $(17,373) , $16,370 and $(46,602) in interest and penalties, respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $101,843 ( $84,530 , net of tax benefits) and $135,821 ( $105,341 , net of tax benefits) were reflected on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S3	The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) for fiscal 2013 and 2014.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S4	The audit by the IRS for fiscal 2010 to 2011 closed during fiscal 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S5	By agreement with the IRS, the Company filed an amended return for fiscal 2012 with adjustments to which the IRS agreed.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S6	The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S7	Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S8	With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2006.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S9	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $567,000 or increase by approximately $98,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P99_S10	The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement medical plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	In addition, the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	The defined benefit pension disclosures include the Company s U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	Postemployment Plans Certain postemployment benefits, including severance benefits, disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits, such as healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage, are provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	These costs are not material and are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P102_S2	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense were as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	_______________ (1) Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Company will change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension expense.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	Historically, the Company selected a discount rate for the U.S. plans by matching the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflected the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P105_S2	Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Company will utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P105_S3	The Company will make this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P105_S4	This change does not affect the measurement of the Company s total benefit obligations.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P105_S5	The Company will account for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, will recognize its effect prospectively beginning in fiscal 2016.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	The Company s U.S. postretirement plan assumed annual rate increase in the per capita cost of health care benefits is 7.0% for the plan year ending June 30, 2016.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	The rate is assumed to decrease on a straight-line basis to 4.5% for the plan year ending June 30, 2027 and remain at that level thereafter.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P107_S2	A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the benefit obligation by $55,255 , while a one percentage point decrease would reduce the benefit obligation by $43,037 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Settlement Charge On January 12, 2015, the Company announced a plan to offer a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible former employees who had vested benefits under the Company s U.S. pension plan, that if accepted, would settle the Company s pension obligations to them.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	The lump sum cash payment offer closed during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P108_S2	In total, more than 4,800 former participants accepted the offer, resulting in lump sum payments from plan assets of $279,571 in May 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P108_S3	As a result of this settlement and the adoption of the new U.S. mortality tables released by the Society of Actuaries, the Company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the U.S. pension plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, which in aggregate resulted in a net reduction to the projected benefit obligation of $179,938 as well as a non-cash settlement charge of $64,382 , pre-tax, in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P108_S4	Pension and Postretirement Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $143,968 (including the above noted settlement charge), $87,422 and $91,771 , respectively.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P108_S5	Postretirement expense for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was not material to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	The changes in the benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company s pension and postretirement benefit plans for fiscal 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	The pre-tax accumulated net loss and prior service (credit) cost recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	Funded Status for Defined Benefit Plans The accumulated benefit obligation for defined benefit pension plans as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	The following information is provided for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and for defined benefit pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1467373_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	Investment Strategies U.S. Pension Plans The overall investment objective of the plans is to provide growth in the defined benefit pension plans assets to help fund future defined benefit pension obligations while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P113_S1	The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Company s current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P113_S3	Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P113_S4	Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P114_S2	In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P115_S1	Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P120_S2	Plan Assets The Company s target allocation for fiscal 2016 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 by asset category, for defined benefit pension plans were as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable.

1467373_15_ITEM15_P322_S0	Exhibit 99.1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Participants of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture plc:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P323_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan) as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2015.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P323_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan s management.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P323_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P323_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P323_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P324_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P324_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P324_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P324_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan as of August 31, 2015 and 2014 and changes in its financial position for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P325_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P326_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P327_S0	The following description of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ) is provided for general information purposes.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P327_S1	Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P328_S0	Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the VEIP ).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P329_S0	General Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company is authorized to issue or transfer up to 45,000,000 Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P330_S0	The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P330_S1	The Company pays all expenses of the Plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P330_S2	The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P331_S0	The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P331_S1	The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P332_S0	In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P332_S1	The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P332_S2	The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P333_S0	Contributions Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as is permitted by the Committee.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P333_S1	Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is 10% (up to a maximum of $8 per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P333_S2	Under the VEIP, eligible participants may choose to contribute up to 30% of their compensation towards the purchase of Shares.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P333_S3	The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P333_S4	Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit based on a percentage of total eligible participant compensation as defined by the Plan and permitted by the Committee.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P333_S5	The aggregate participation limit percentage was 11% prior to July 25, 2012 at which time the Committee resolved to increase the percentage to 15%.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P333_S6	If aggregate compensation is projected to reach this cap, then contributions will stop and participants would be refunded contributions not used to purchase shares.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P334_S0	A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the applicable offering period as determined by the Committee.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P334_S1	Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P334_S2	All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account under the Plan and are deposited with the general funds of the Company.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P334_S3	All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P334_S4	Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal 2015 included the six-month periods ended November 1, 2013 and May 1, 2014 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P334_S5	The current offering period commenced on May 2, 2015 and will end on November 1, 2015 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P335_S0	The VEIP has a calendar year offering period and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5 th of the subsequent month.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P336_S0	Share Purchases As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P336_S1	Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P336_S2	A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:
1467373_15_ITEM15_P337_S0	As of August 31, 2015 , 36,729,462 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares had been issued under the Plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P338_S0	Withdrawals Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P338_S1	Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law).
1467373_15_ITEM15_P338_S2	A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P338_S3	A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P339_S0	The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan (or pursuant to outstanding awards) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P340_S0	In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any option as of the date of consummation of the change in control.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P341_S0	Plan Amendment and Termination The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan, or without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P341_S1	The Plan will terminate upon the earliest of: (1) the termination of the Plan by the Board; (2) the issuance of all of the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan; or (3) the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P341_S2	The Board has not initiated actions to terminate the Plan, and unless otherwise noted, has not amended the Plan.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P342_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P343_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Plan s management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the accompanying financial statements and disclosures.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P343_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P344_S0	As of August 31, 2015 , Contributions receivable represents payroll deductions from participants with respect to the ESPP offering period beginning May 2, 2015 and ending November 1, 2015 , as well as the VEIP contribution period beginning August 1, 2015 and ending August 31, 2015 .
1467373_15_ITEM15_P344_S1	These payroll deductions are held by Accenture plc and/or its affiliates.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P345_S0	Plan equity represents net assets available for future share purchases or participant withdrawals.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P345_S1	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the Plan s statement of financial condition date.
1467373_15_ITEM15_P345_S2	Based on this evaluation, the Company is not aware of any events or transactions that occurred subsequent to the Plan s statement of financial condition date but prior to filing that would require recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.

1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc have the ability, subject to the restrictions on redemption contained in Accen ture Holdings plc s articles of association and the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland (the Companies Act ) and any contractual restrictions on redemption that may be applicable to a holder, to require that Accenture Holdings plc redeem all or a portion of such holder s ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	In that case, Accenture Holdings plc is obligated, subject to the availability of distributable reserves, to redeem any such ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	The redemption price per share generally equals the average of the high and low sale prices of a Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day on which Accenture Holdings plc receives an irrevocable notice of redemption from a holder of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc if received prior to close of trading for that day, or on the following trading day if Accenture Holdings plc receives the irrevocable notice of redemption later than the close of trading on that day.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	Accenture Holdings plc may, at its option, pay the redemption price in cash or by instructing Accenture plc to deliver Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for dividends and share splits.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S5	Except in the case of a redemption of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or a transfer of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture Holdings plc s articles of association provide that Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares may be transferred only with the consent of the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S6	In addition, all holders of ordinary shares (except Accenture plc) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture Holdings plc or transferred to Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture Holdings plc determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law or regulation, or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture Holdings plc or its affiliates for Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, ordinary shares, until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares in the tender offer).
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S7	Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S8	Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S9	Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.
1467373_16_ITEM1_P53_S10	The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in North America and Europe.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Weak demand in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	In addition, because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of North America and Europe, an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S12	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving as developments such as artificial intelligence, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things and as-a-service solutions are commercialized.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S15	Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S16	Some of these technologies, such as cloud-based services, artificial intelligence and automation, and others that may emerge, have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S17	This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S18	Such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S19	Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S20	If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P1_S21	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	At any given time in a particular industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry and/or geography.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S8	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S10	We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S11	For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S12	As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S13	Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S14	We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively manage our current contracts and client relationships could be jeopardized.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S15	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S16	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S17	Our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S18	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S19	If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our profitability could suffer.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S20	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P3_S21	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Additionally, if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S7	In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S8	If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S9	The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P7_S10	The markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Some competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals, may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Over time, our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P8_S11	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners and vendors.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of analytics.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection (which will be replaced by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation from 2018 onwards), various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following: Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S8	If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P12_S9	The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	the procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability to the degree we have done in the past.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our workforce to lower-cost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs, it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to recover employee compensation increases through improved pricing, automation or the movement of work to lower-cost locations, we may not be able to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth, we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S10	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P16_S9	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Furthermore, a number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Additionally, some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S10	We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S12	The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas, including risks related to data security.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P25_S6	As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We may not successfully identify suitable investment opportunities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S7	We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S10	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P34_S11	Acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S5	While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S7	For example, natural disasters of the type described below, some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Additionally, both India and the Philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability, worker strikes, civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully below, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P41_S11	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 55 countries around the world.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Our growth strategy might not be successful.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S7	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P42_S9	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S6	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S7	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S9	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S10	The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S11	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S12	Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P43_S13	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S5	For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S7	In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliance partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	could lessen related demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S8	In addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S9	If we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S10	Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S11	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S12	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S13	Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S14	We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P48_S15	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S6	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, cybersecurity breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S8	There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P49_S9	Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately 384,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S4	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S5	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S6	The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S7	For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S9	If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S10	In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S11	We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S12	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S13	The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S14	We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S15	These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P50_S16	If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P52_S5	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P56_S4	We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P56_S5	The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize a U.S. judgment.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P60_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company s authorized but unissued share capital.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P61_S4	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P61_S5	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1467373_16_ITEM4_P0_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Our executive officers and persons chosen to become executive officers as of the date hereof are as follows: Gianfranco Casati , 57, became our group chief executive Growth Markets in January 2014.

1467373_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.6% , compared with 14.3% for fiscal 2015 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	margin by 20 basis points for fiscal 2015 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Excluding the effect of the Pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2015 would have been 14.5% .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	During fiscal 2016 , we recorded a $548 million gain on sale of business and $56 million in taxes related to the divestiture of our Navitaire business, as well as a $301 million gain on sale of business and $48 million in taxes related to the partial divestiture of our Duck Creek business.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22.4% , compared with 25.8% for fiscal 2015 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Absent the $849 million Gain on sale of businesses and related $104 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2016 , our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2% .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Absent the $64 million Pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2015 , our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0% .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	Diluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016 , compared with $4.76 for fiscal 2015 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	The Gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, recorded during fiscal 2016 increased Diluted earnings per share by $1.11 in fiscal 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	The Pension settlement charge, net of taxes, recorded during fiscal 2015 decreased Diluted earnings per share by $0.06 in fiscal 2015 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S6	Excluding these impacts, Diluted earnings per share would have been $5.34 and $4.82 for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S7	We have presented Operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and Diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the fiscal 2016 Gain on sale of businesses and the fiscal 2015 Pension settlement charge, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S8	Our Operating income and Diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S9	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S10	Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S11	We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P11_S12	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Bookings and Backlog New bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 were $8.99 billion , with consulting bookings of $4.81 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.18 billion .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	New bookings for fiscal 2016 were $35.39 billion , with consulting bookings of $19.16 billion and outsourcing bookings of $16.23 billion .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	New bookings involve estimates and judgments.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P23_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P32_S6	While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	During fiscal 2015, the Company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded a tax liability of $247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P42_S5	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P42_S6	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P44_S4	However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P44_S5	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P44_S6	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media Technology; Financial Services; Health Public Service; Products; and Resources.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P45_S4	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	_______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our business in the United States represented 46% , 43% and 40% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 :
1467373_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Communications, Media Technology net revenues increased 9% in local currency.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Net revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups in North America and Growth Markets, as well as Media Entertainment in Europe.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in both industry groups across all geographic regions, led by Banking Capital Markets in Europe.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Health Public Service net revenues increased 12% in local currency.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in both industry groups across all geographic regions, led by Public Service and Health in North America.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Products net revenues increased 15% in local currency.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail Travel Services, as well as Industrial in Europe and Life Sciences in North America.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Resources net revenues increased 3% in local currency.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Net revenues reflected modest growth, as significant growth in Utilities across all geographic regions was largely offset by declines in Chemicals Natural Resources in Growth Markets and North America and Energy in Europe and Growth Markets.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	We have experienced lower or negative revenue growth in Chemicals Natural Resources and Energy, principally due to economic challenges in these industries, and we expect this trend to continue in the near term.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	North America net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by the United States.

1467373_16_ITEM7_P107_S11	Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $169 million and $167 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P107_S12	In addition, we had total outstanding debt of approximately $27 million at both August 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2016 was as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	_______________ (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	(2) During fiscal 2016 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P109_S3	These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2017 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P110_S2	Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2016 , we issued 775,023 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement ).
1467373_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	The registration statement allows us , at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Subsequent Developments On September 27, 2016 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 21, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	On September 28, 2016 , the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share on its ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 18, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2016 , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
1467373_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	(1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	(2) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P116_S3	(3) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P116_S4	Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	We adopted this ASU using the retrospective method which required reclassification of current deferred taxes as previously reported on our August 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets to non-current, resulting in an increase to non-current deferred tax assets of $816 million and a decrease to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $22 million .
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements On March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S2	In addition, the ASU includes provisions that impact the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification of excess tax benefits on the cash flow statements.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S3	We will early adopt the standard effective September 1, 2016.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S4	Following adoption, the primary impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which will likely result in increased volatility in the reported amounts of income tax expense and net income.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S5	We estimate this change will reduce our fiscal 2017 effective tax rate by less than two percentage points.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S6	The actual impact of adopting this standard on the effective tax rate will vary depending on our share price during fiscal 2017.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S7	Provisions of the new guidance related to changes to classification of excess tax benefits in the cash flow statements are expected to be adopted retrospectively.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P119_S8	We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of the adoption of this guidance and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2020, and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P121_S2	We are assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P122_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P124_S3	We will adopt the guidance on September 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method.
1467373_16_ITEM7_P124_S4	We are assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P0_S9	For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2016 , it was anticipated that approximately $61 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $328 million and $305 million as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively .
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2016 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Other Market Risk The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P3_S5	We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of August 31, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM7A_P3_S6	The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and iii.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S5	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S6	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
1467373_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Accenture plc : We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S1	We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S2	Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P8_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P9_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P9_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P10_S1	Also in our opinion, Accenture plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P16_S2	Accenture plc s global delivery model enables it to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company ).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	Accenture plc s only business is to hold ordinary and deferred shares in, and to act as the controlling shareholder of, its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	The Company operates its business through Accenture Holdings plc and subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S3	Accenture plc controls Accenture Holdings plc s management and operations and consolidates Accenture Holdings plc s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S4	On April 10, 2015, Accenture Holdings plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to further consolidate Accenture s presence in Ireland.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S5	On August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA merged with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S6	This merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P17_S7	All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	The shares of Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	The noncontrolling interest percentages were 4% and 5% as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Company s fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	For example, a reference to fiscal 2016 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P19_S2	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P22_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P22_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	If the Company s estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	In such contracts, the Company s efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P24_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P24_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	In such contracts, the Company s effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P26_S4	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S4	Deferred transition costs were $709,444 and $630,420 as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S5	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S6	Deferred transition revenues were $604,674 and $522,968 as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P28_S7	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P29_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P29_S3	The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P29_S4	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P29_S5	Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Company s accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in the Company s control.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P29_S6	While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale, as well as revenues from alliance agreements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P37_S3	Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P38_S2	Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P38_S3	Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including certificates of deposit and time deposits.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	Cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash of $45,478 and $45,935 as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which primarily relates to cash held to meet certain insurance requirements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P41_S2	As of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $79,440 and $70,165 , respectively.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P41_S3	The allowance reflects the Company s best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Non-current investments are primarily non-marketable equity securities of privately held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or cost methods of accounting, in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale investments and reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Cost method investments are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	For investments in privately held companies, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, the fair value is not estimated.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	If an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, the Company reduces the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establishes a new cost basis for the investment.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of net assets acquired.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company reviews the recoverability of goodwill by reportable operating segment annually, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P49_S2	Based on the results of its annual impairment analysis, the Company determined that no impairment existed as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , as each reportable operating segment s estimated fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including deferred contract costs and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P50_S2	If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recorded equal to the amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	_______________ (1) For additional information, see Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company adopted this ASU using the retrospective method which required reclassification of current deferred taxes as previously reported on the Company s August 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets to non-current, resulting in an increase to non-current deferred tax assets of $815,909 and a decrease to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $22,218 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements On March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	In addition, the ASU includes provisions that impact the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification of excess tax benefits on the cash flow statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S3	The Company will early adopt the standard effective September 1, 2016.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S4	Following adoption, the primary impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements will be the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which will likely result in increased volatility in the reported amounts of income tax expense and net income.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S5	The Company estimates this change will reduce its fiscal 2017 effective tax rate by less than two percentage points.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S6	The actual impact of adopting this standard on the effective tax rate will vary depending on the Company s share price during fiscal 2017.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S7	Provisions of the new guidance related to changes to classification of excess tax benefits in the cash flow statements are expected to be adopted retrospectively.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P55_S8	The Company is continuing to evaluate the impacts of the adoption of this guidance and its preliminary assessments are subject to change.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in its fiscal year 2018.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in its fiscal year 2020, and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company is assessing the impact of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in its fiscal year 2019.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P79_S2	Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P79_S3	The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P79_S4	The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Company s derivative financial instruments, was $129,603 as of August 31, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P80_S2	The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P80_S3	These provisions may reduce the Company s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P80_S4	Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P80_S5	Similarly, a decrement in the Company s credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Company s realized loss on an open transaction.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August 31, 2016 was $33,774 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P82_S2	All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P82_S3	Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P82_S4	For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P83_S2	The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P83_S3	As of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P84_S2	Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	The amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were a net gain of $23,004 and $15,207 during fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and a net loss of $101,026 during fiscal 2014 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , was not material.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2016 and 2015 or 2014 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P88_S2	Other Derivatives The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P88_S3	These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P88_S4	Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net loss of $84,293 and $257,783 for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and a net gain of $78,446 for fiscal 2014 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P88_S5	Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Company records derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	BORROWINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS As of August 31, 2016 , the Company had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	_______________ (1) On December 22, 2015 , the Company replaced its $1,000,000 syndicated loan facility maturing on October 31, 2016 with a $1,000,000 syndicated loan facility maturing on December 22, 2020 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	This facility provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company s effective income tax rate was as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	_______________ (1) Final determinations include final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	During fiscal 2015 , the Company concluded that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries would no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded an estimated tax liability of $247,097 for withholding taxes payable on the distribution of these earnings.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	These earnings were distributed in the form of a U.S. dividend declared and paid on August 26, 2015 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P97_S2	The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest any future U.S. earnings.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P97_S3	As of August 31, 2016 , the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $1,297,932 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P97_S4	If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P97_S5	The unrecognized deferred tax liability (the amount payable if distributed) is approximately $116,000 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	Portions of the Company s operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal 2017 and 2021 .

1467373_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of enacted changes in tax laws and tax rates did not have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	The components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company recorded valuation allowances of $1,243,207 and $1,229,146 as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax credit and tax net operating loss carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P100_S2	During fiscal 2016 , the Company recorded a net increase of $14,061 in the valuation allowance.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P100_S3	The majority of this change related to valuation allowances on certain tax net operating loss carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P100_S4	The Company had tax credit carryforwards as of August 31, 2016 of $1,161,084 , of which $30,288 will expire between 2017 and 2026 , $828 will expire between 2027 and 2036 , and $1,129,968 has an indefinite carryforward period.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P102_S1	During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized expense (benefit) of $8,681 , $(17,373) and $16,370 in interest and penalties, respectively.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	Compliance Assurance Program ( CAP ) beginning with the 2016 fiscal year.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S1	As part of CAP, tax years are audited on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are resolved prior to the filing of the tax return.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S2	The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal 2013 and 2014.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S3	The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S4	Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S5	With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2007.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S6	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $562,000 or increase by approximately $169,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P103_S7	The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement medical plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P104_S1	In addition, the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P105_S1	The defined benefit pension disclosures include the Company s U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P105_S2	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense were as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension expense.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Historically, the Company selected a discount rate for the U.S. plans by matching the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflected the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P107_S2	Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Company utilized a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P107_S3	The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P107_S4	This change does not affect the measurement of the Company s total benefit obligations.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P107_S5	The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, recognized its effect prospectively beginning in fiscal 2016.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and are subject to change each year.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	The Company s U.S. postretirement plan assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of health care benefits is 6.8% for the plan year ending June 30, 2017.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	The rate is assumed to decrease on a straight-line basis to 4.5% for the plan year ending June 30, 2027 and remain at that level thereafter.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the benefit obligation by $81,422 , while a one percentage point decrease would reduce the benefit obligation by $62,615 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Settlement Charge During fiscal 2015, the Company offered a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible former employees who had vested benefits under the Company s U.S. pension plan that, if accepted, would settle the Company s pension obligations to them.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	This resulted in lump sum payments from plan assets of $279,571 during fiscal 2015.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P111_S2	As a result of this settlement and the adoption of the new U.S. mortality tables released by the Society of Actuaries, the Company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the U.S. pension plan, which in aggregate resulted in a net reduction to the projected benefit obligation of $179,938 as well as a non-cash settlement charge of $64,382 , pre-tax, during fiscal 2015.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P111_S3	Pension and Postretirement Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $94,827 , $143,968 (including the above noted settlement charge) and $87,422 , respectively.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P111_S4	Postretirement expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was not material to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	The pre-tax accumulated net loss and prior service (credit) cost recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	Funded Status for Defined Benefit Plans The accumulated benefit obligation for defined benefit pension plans as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	The following information is provided for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and for defined benefit pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1467373_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	Investment Strategies U.S. Pension Plans The overall investment objective of the defined benefit pension plans is to match the duration of the plans assets to the plans liabilities while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P116_S1	The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Company s current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P116_S2	The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P116_S3	Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P116_S4	Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P117_S1	The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P117_S2	In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to risks including market, interest rate and operating risk.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P123_S2	Plan Assets The Company s target allocation for fiscal 2017 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 by asset category for defined benefit pension plans were as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P125_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P125_S2	The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P129_S1	The Company estimates it will pay approximately $80,077 in fiscal 2017 related to contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and benefit payments related to the unfunded frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P129_S2	The Company has not determined whether it will make additional voluntary contributions for its defined benefit pension plans.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P129_S3	The Company s postretirement plan contributions in fiscal 2017 are not expected to be material to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby the Company has joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S2	In addition, the Company s consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that the Company s solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S4	Typically, the Company has contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S5	Payments by the Company under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by the Company typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S6	The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S8	For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S9	To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S10	The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P156_S13	Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition.

1467373_16_ITEM15_P237_S0	Exhibit 99.1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Participants of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture plc:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P238_S0	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ), as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P238_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan s management.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P238_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P238_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P238_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P239_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P239_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P239_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P239_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 and its operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P240_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P241_S0	The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P242_S0	The following description of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan ) is provided for general information purposes.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P242_S1	Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P243_S0	Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the VEIP ).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P244_S0	General Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company was authorized to issue or transfer up to 45,000,000 Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S0	The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S1	The Company pays all expenses of the Plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S2	The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S3	At its October 30, 2015 meeting, the Board delegated to the Committee the authority to approve the issuance of an additional 45,000,000 Shares of the Company under the Plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S4	At its December 4, 2015 meeting, the Committee approved the issuance of an additional 45,000,000 Shares under the Plan, subject to shareholder approval.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S5	The Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company at the February 3, 2016 annual general meeting.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S6	The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P245_S7	The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P246_S0	In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P246_S1	The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P246_S2	The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P247_S0	Contributions Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s eligible compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as permitted by the Committee.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P247_S1	Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is 10% (up to a maximum of $7,500 per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P247_S2	Under the VEIP, eligible participants may choose to contribute up to 30% of their eligible compensation towards the purchase of Shares.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P247_S3	The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P247_S4	Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit as permitted by the Committee.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P247_S5	The current aggregate contribution limit percentage is 15% of aggregate global Accenture Leader cash compensation.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P247_S6	If aggregate participant contributions are projected to exceed this cap, contributions will stop and participants will be refunded contributions not used to purchase Shares.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S0	A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the end of the applicable enrollment period as determined by the Committee.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S1	Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S2	All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account and are deposited with the general funds of the Company.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S3	All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment (unless otherwise required by law) .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S4	Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal 2016 included the six-month periods ended November 1, 2015 and May 1, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S5	The current offering period commenced on May 2, 2016 and will end on November 1, 2016 .
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S6	The VEIP has a calendar year offering period, as well as a limited mid-year enrollment period, and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5th of the subsequent month.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S7	As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S8	Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P248_S9	A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:
1467373_16_ITEM15_P249_S0	As of August 31, 2016 , 42,579,575 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares had been issued under the Plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P250_S0	Withdrawals Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P250_S1	Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law).
1467373_16_ITEM15_P250_S2	A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P250_S3	A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P251_S0	The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan (or pursuant to outstanding purchase rights ) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P251_S1	In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any purchase rights as of the date of consummation of the change in control.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P252_S0	Plan Amendment and Termination The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan without prior shareholder consent , or, without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P252_S1	The Plan will terminate upon the earliest of: (1) the termination of the Plan by the Board; (2) the issuance of all of the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan; or (3) December 10, 2024.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P252_S2	The Board has not initiated actions to terminate the Plan, and unless otherwise noted, has not amended the Plan.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P253_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P254_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Plan s management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the accompanying financial statements and disclosures.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P254_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P255_S0	As of August 31, 2016 , contributions receivable represents payroll deductions from participants with respect to the ESPP offering period beginning May 2, 2016 and ending November 1, 2016 , as well as the VEIP contribution period beginning August 1, 2016 and ending August 31, 2016 .

1467373_16_ITEM15_P256_S0	Plan equity represents net assets available for future share purchases or participant withdrawals.
1467373_16_ITEM15_P257_S0	3. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the Plan s statement of financial condition date.

1467373_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary and Deferred Shares Only Accenture plc, Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture International S. .r.l.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	and certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees hold Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Each ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	As of October 12, 2017, Accenture plc holds a voting interest of approximately 96% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 4% of the voting interest held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	Only Accenture plc beneficially holds Accenture Holdings plc deferred shares.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P50_S5	The deferred shares were issued solely to ensure that Accenture Holdings plc satisfies Irish law minimum share capital requirements for public limited companies at all times and carry no voting rights or income rights and have only limited rights on a return of capital equal to the nominal value of those shares.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc have the ability, subject to the restrictions on redemption contained in Accenture Holdings plc s articles of association and the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland (the Companies Act ) and any contractual restrictions on redemption that may be applicable to a holder, to require that Accenture Holdings plc redeem all or a portion of such holder s ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	In that case, Accenture Holdings plc is obligated, subject to the availability of distributable reserves, to redeem any such ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	The redemption price per share generally equals the average of the high and low sale prices of a Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day on which Accenture Holdings plc receives an irrevocable notice of redemption from a holder of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc if received prior to close of trading for that day, or on the following trading day if Accenture Holdings plc receives the irrevocable notice of redemption later than the close of trading on that day.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	Accenture Holdings plc may, at its option, pay the redemption price in cash or by instructing Accenture plc to deliver Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for dividends and share splits.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S4	In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S5	Except in the case of a redemption of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares or a transfer of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture Holdings plc s articles of association provide that Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares may be transferred only with the consent of the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S6	In addition, all holders of ordinary shares (except Accenture plc) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture Holdings plc or transferred to Accenture Holdings plc, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture Holdings plc determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law or regulation, or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture Holdings plc or its affiliates for Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares, or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, ordinary shares, until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares in the tender offer).
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S7	Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S8	Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S9	Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.
1467373_17_ITEM1_P51_S10	The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S10	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S15	This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S16	Such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S17	Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S18	If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S19	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P1_S20	If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	At any given time in a particular industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry and/or geography.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S8	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S10	We must hire or retrain, retain, and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S11	For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S12	There is intense competition for scarce talent with skills in new technologies, and we may be unable to cost-effectively hire new employees with these skills, which may cause us to incur increased costs.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S13	As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S14	Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S15	We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively manage our current contracts and client relationships could be jeopardized.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S16	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S17	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S18	Our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S19	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S20	If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our profitability could suffer.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S21	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P3_S22	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Additionally, if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S7	In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S8	If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P7_S9	We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people, clients, alliance partners and vendors.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients, alliance partners and vendors, and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of analytics.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who continuously develop and deploy viruses, ransomware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection (which will be replaced by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation from 2018 onwards), various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Some competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals, may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Over time, our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S11	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S13	Our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following: Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S14	If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P11_S15	The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	the procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability to the degree we have done in the past.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our workforce to lower-cost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs, it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to recover employee compensation increases through improved pricing, automation or the movement of work to lower-cost locations, we may not be able to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth, we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S8	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S10	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P14_S12	Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and the expiration of current tax benefits.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic conditions and tax policies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Furthermore, a number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Additionally, some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S10	We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas, including risks related to data security.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P21_S8	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P24_S6	As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We may not successfully identify suitable investment opportunities.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S10	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S11	The potential loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P34_S12	Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities, internal controls and security environment.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100%.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Our global delivery capability is concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery capability in India, where we have the largest number of people located in our delivery centers, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S7	For example, natural disasters of the type described below, some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Additionally, both India and the Philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability, worker strikes, civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully below, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P41_S11	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 53 countries around the world.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Our growth strategy might not be successful.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters and security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, sea level rise, floods, droughts and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as physical infrastructure damage to, system failures at, cyberattacks on, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S6	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S7	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S8	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S9	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S10	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S11	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S12	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S13	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data privacy and protection, government compliance, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S14	The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S15	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S16	Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P43_S17	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines, enforcement actions and/or criminal prosecution or sanctions, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S5	For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P44_S7	In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliance partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Many of our alliance partners are also large clients, and some are suppliers of technology to Accenture.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Our performance in delivering client work, and decisions that Accenture makes in choosing suppliers, may negatively impact our alliance relationships.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P47_S6	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary methodologies, processes, software and other solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P49_S5	These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we are unable to implement in a cost-effective manner alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Additionally, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Further, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S8	If we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, cybersecurity breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S4	There is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S7	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S8	As of August 31, 2017, we had approximately 425,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S10	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S11	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S12	The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S13	For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S14	Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S15	If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S16	In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S17	We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S18	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S19	The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S20	We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S21	These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P51_S22	If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P58_S5	The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize a U.S. judgment.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P63_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company s authorized but unissued share capital.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
1467373_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.
1467373_17_ITEM4_P0_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Our executive officers and persons chosen to become executive officers as of the date hereof are as follows: Gianfranco Casati , 58, became our group chief executive Growth Markets in January 2014.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P9_S9	For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P9_S10	We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P9_S11	Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for fiscal 2017 was 31.7% , compared with 31.3% for fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017 was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.9% for fiscal 2017 , compared with 16.6% for fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	For fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues increased 40 basis points, principally due to higher technology and facilities costs, as well as higher acquisition-related costs.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	During fiscal 2017 , we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P10_S6	For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for fiscal 2017 was 13.3% , compared with 14.6% for fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 would have been 14.8% .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	During fiscal 2016 , we recorded a $548 million gain on sale of business and $56 million in taxes related to the divestiture of our Navitaire business, as well as a $301 million gain on sale of business and $48 million in taxes related to the partial divestiture of our Duck Creek business.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 21.3% , compared with 22.4% for fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes described above, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0% .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Absent the gain on sale of our Navitaire and Duck Creek businesses and related taxes described above , our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2% .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Diluted earnings per share were $5.44 for fiscal 2017 , compared with $6.45 for fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in fiscal 2017 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	The gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $1.11 in fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $5.91 and $5.34 for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the fiscal 2017 pension settlement charge and the fiscal 2016 gain on sale of businesses, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S6	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S7	Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S8	We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P13_S9	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Bookings and Backlog New bookings for fiscal 2017 were $37.4 billion , with consulting bookings of $19.8 billion and outsourcing bookings of $17.6 billion .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	New bookings involve estimates and judgments.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P35_S4	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P35_S5	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P35_S6	While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	During fiscal 2015, the Company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded a tax liability of $247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P45_S5	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P45_S6	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P47_S5	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P47_S6	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media Technology; Financial Services; Health Public Service; Products; and Resources.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	Consulting net revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P48_S4	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P49_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P49_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	_______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our business in the United States represented 45% , 46% and 43% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net Revenues We have changed the structure of our Communications, Media Technology operating group to reflect the continued convergence of the communications, media and entertainment industries, as well as the opportunity we are seeing in the software and platform sectors.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The new structure includes the following industry groups: Communications Media (Telecommunications, Cable, Broadcasting and Content Publishing); Software Platforms (Internet Social and Software); and High Tech (Network Equipment Providers, Aerospace Defense, Consumer Technology, Semiconductor, Medical Equipment and Enterprise Markets).

1467373_17_ITEM7_P64_S6	The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017 was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues, compared to fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P64_S7	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 increased $174 million , or 5% , over fiscal 2016 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.8% from 10.9% during this period.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 increased 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:
1467373_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	(1) Represents pension settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2017 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	In addition, during fiscal 2017, each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 :
1467373_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Communications, Media Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Health Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower outsourcing contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenues.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Products operating income increased principally due to very strong revenue growth, as well as higher consulting contract profitability.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Resources operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenue.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	During fiscal 2017 , other expense decreased $31 million from fiscal 2016 , primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	Gain (Loss) on Sale of Business es We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of $548 million and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture of $301 million during fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P75_S3	For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 21.3% , compared with 22.4% for fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million , the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0% .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	Absent the gain on sale of businesses of $849 million and related tax impact of $104 million , the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2% .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes, other adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, and the recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	This was partially offset by a net increase to prior-year non-U.S. tax liabilities, primarily related to a final assessment of prior-year taxes in Switzerland.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P76_S5	The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate also benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P76_S6	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million , or 20% , from fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	The decrease was due to lower net income of $715 million , primarily driven by the pension settlement charge recorded during fiscal 2017 as well as the gain on sale of businesses recorded during fiscal 2016.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P77_S5	Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.44 for fiscal 2017 , compared with $6.45 for fiscal 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P77_S6	The $1.01 decrease in our diluted earnings per share included both the impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47 and the impact of the gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P77_S7	Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $5.91 and $5.34 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.57 due to increases of $0.38 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.06 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.04 from lower non-operating expense.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Resources net revenues increased 3% in local currency.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Net revenues reflected modest growth, as significant growth in Utilities across all geographic regions was largely offset by declines in Chemicals Natural Resources in Growth Markets and North America and Energy in Europe and Growth Markets.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	We experienced lower or negative revenue growth in Chemicals Natural Resources and Energy, principally due to economic challenges in these industries.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P88_S5	Gross margin for fiscal 2016 decreased to 31.3% from 31.6% in fiscal 2015.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P88_S6	The reduction in gross margin for fiscal 2016 was principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to fiscal 2015.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P88_S7	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2016 increased $75 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2015, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.9% from 11.3% in fiscal 2015.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:
1467373_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Communications, Media Technology operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and consulting revenue growth.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	During fiscal 2016, Other expense, net increased $25 million over fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P100_S3	For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22.4%, compared with 25.8% for fiscal 2015.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	Absent the $849 million gain on sale of businesses and related $104 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2016, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	Absent the $64 million pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P101_S3	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 benefited from a final determination of U.S. federal taxes for fiscal 2012.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P101_S5	This was offset by expenses associated with an increase in deferred tax liabilities during fiscal 2015, when we concluded that certain undistributed earnings of our U.S. subsidiaries would no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P101_S6	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P102_S4	The increase was due to higher net income of $1,076 million, primarily driven by the gain on sale of businesses, partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest during fiscal 2016.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P102_S5	Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016, compared with $4.76 for fiscal 2015.The $1.69 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11 and the impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.06.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P102_S6	Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 increased $0.52 compared with fiscal 2015, due to increases of $0.34 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.13 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P102_S7	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 from higher non-operating expense.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	In addition, we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P103_S3	We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:
1467373_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	As of August 31, 2017 , Cash and cash equivalents were $4.1 billion , compared with $4.9 billion as of August 31, 2016 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:
1467373_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Operating activities: The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income in fiscal 2017 after excluding the non-cash impact of the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017 and the gain on sale of businesses in fiscal 2016 (proceeds from divestitures are reflected in investing activities).
1467373_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities increased $1,624 million year-over-year, due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments in fiscal 2017.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P106_S2	Additionally, in fiscal 2016, spending on business acquisitions and investments was largely offset by proceeds from the Navitaire divestiture and Duck Creek partial divestiture.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P106_S3	For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Financing activities: The $71 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from share issuances.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	Borrowing Facilities See Note 8 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2018 .
1467373_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.

1467373_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2017 , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
1467373_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	_______________ (1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	(2) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P115_S2	These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P115_S3	(3) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P115_S4	Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P116_S2	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7_P116_S3	Recently Adopted and New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Swedish krona are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P0_S9	For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2017 , it was anticipated that approximately $112 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $494 million and $328 million as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively .
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2017 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Other Market Risk The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P3_S5	We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of August 31, 2017 .
1467373_17_ITEM7A_P3_S6	The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and iii.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S5	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S6	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
1467373_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Competition We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:
1467373_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	global reach and scale, including level of presence in key emerging markets.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	We provide value to our clients based in part on a differentiated range of proprietary inventions, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	We recognize the increasing value of intellectual property in the marketplace and create, harvest, and protect this intellectual property.

1467373_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	To protect the Accenture brand, one of our most valuable assets, we rely on intellectual property laws and trademark registrations held around the world.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	Trademarks appearing in this report are the trademarks or registered trademarks of Accenture Global Services Ltd., Accenture Global Solutions Ltd., or third parties, as applicable.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Organizational Structure and History Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture plc.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Class I common shares of Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares and direct subsidiary of Accenture Ltd ( Accenture SCA ), or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P44_S4	Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P44_S5	The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	This transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S3	On April 10, 2015, Accenture Holdings plc, then Accenture plc s subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to further consolidate Accenture s presence in Ireland.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S4	On August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA merged with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S5	This merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S6	On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S7	As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P45_S8	In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc).
1467373_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc (for applicable periods) and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Accenture Leadership is comprised of members of our global management committee (our primary management and leadership team, which consists of approximately 20 of our most senior leaders), senior managing directors and managing directors.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was less than 1% as of August 31, 2018.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	As described above under Organizational Structure and History, Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P49_S4	Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P50_S4	Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.
1467373_18_ITEM1_P50_S5	The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of the United Kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the European Union, the potential for changes in global trade policies and trends such as populism and economic nationalism, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S10	As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S15	This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S16	Such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S17	Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S18	If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P1_S19	Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	At any given time in a particular operating group, business, industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our consolidated revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant operating group, business, industry and/or geography.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S10	When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S12	The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S13	If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S14	Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S15	We must hire or reskill, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and constantly innovate to grow our business.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S16	For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S17	There is intense competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our competitors have directly targeted our employees with these highly sought-after skills and may continue to do so.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S18	As a result, we may be unable to cost-effectively hire and retain employees with these market-leading skills, which may cause us to incur increased costs.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S19	As technology evolves and we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with unique and highly specialized skills.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S20	We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S21	If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S22	We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S23	This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees may be limited, and competition for these resources is intense.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S24	Our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, develop, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S25	Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S26	If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our profitability could suffer.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S27	If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P2_S28	If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	There is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Additionally, if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people, clients, alliance partners and vendors.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients, alliance partners and vendors, and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of artificial intelligence, the internet of things and analytics.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, misappropriation, or other intentional or unintentional acts, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our or our service providers information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who continuously develop and deploy viruses, ransomware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which became effective in May 2018, various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The GDPR imposes new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	For example, failure to comply with the GDPR may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, orders to discontinue certain data processing operations, private lawsuits, or reputational damage.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Some competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals, may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Over time, our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S11	If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P10_S12	Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the expiration of current tax benefits and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	For example, in December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), which significantly changed U.S. tax law.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The Tax Act s base erosion and anti-abuse tax provisions, or regulations issued thereunder, could adversely impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ), which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The changes recommended by the OECD have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, the European Commission has expanded upon the OECD guidelines with anti-tax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Among other things, the directives require companies to provide increased country-by-country disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities, which in turn could lead to disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also subject us to increased taxation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following: Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P14_S9	The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	the procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S10	In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S11	Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S12	In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P16_S13	Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Additionally, some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 52 countries around the world.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our growth strategy might not be successful.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including the concentration of our global delivery capability in India and the Philippines, international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters and security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Our global delivery capability is concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S9	While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery capability in India, where we have the largest number of people located in our delivery centers, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks, including those listed in the following paragraph, many of which are beyond our control.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S12	If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S13	International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S14	Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, sea level rise, floods, droughts and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S15	These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S16	These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners, suppliers or clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S17	By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S18	Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as physical infrastructure damage to, system failures at, cyberattacks on, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S19	We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S20	We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S21	If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S22	We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S23	In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S24	This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S25	Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S26	We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data privacy and protection, government compliance, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S27	The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P21_S28	Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines, enforcement actions and/or criminal prosecution or sanctions, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S10	Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S11	The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief against us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S12	Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S13	For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S14	We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S15	In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S16	We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S17	If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S18	In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas, including risks related to data security.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P23_S19	A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our ability to work for the U.S. government is impacted by the fact that we are an Irish company.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense that enhances the ability of our U.S. federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the U.S. government.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of, and limits the control we can exercise over, this subsidiary.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	As of August 31, 2018, we had approximately 459,000 employees worldwide.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S8	The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S9	For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S10	Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S11	If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S12	In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S13	If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S14	We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S15	A very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S16	The business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S17	The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours, and our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P37_S18	In addition, some of our alliance partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to Accenture.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	If we are unable to maintain our relationships with current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of alliance partners, we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, cybersecurity breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	There is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S8	We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S9	We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S11	We may not succeed in completing targeted transactions, including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive, or achieve desired results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S12	Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S13	Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S14	In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S15	The potential loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P39_S16	Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities, internal controls and security environment.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100%.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary methodologies, processes, software and other solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S6	We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P45_S7	These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Even where we obtain intellectual property protection, our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors, former employees, or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P46_S4	In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Additionally, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we are unable to implement in a cost-effective manner alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Further, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S7	If we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S8	Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S9	Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S10	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P48_S11	It is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P52_S5	These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P54_S4	If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P54_S5	We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Although the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, the Irish Courts will recognize a U.S. judgment if the following important requirements are satisfied: the originating court is a court of competent jurisdiction; the judgment is final and conclusive; and the judgment was not obtained by fraud and its recognition is not contrary to Irish public policy.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P61_S4	If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company s authorized but unissued share capital.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
1467373_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.

1467373_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	We use the terms Accenture, we, the Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	For example, a reference to fiscal 2018 means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2018 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period s foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for fiscal 2018 increased 13.5% in U.S. dollars and 10.5% in local currency compared to fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Demand for our services and solutions continued to be very strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	During fiscal 2018 , revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Communication, Media Technology, Resources and Products and strong in Financial Services and Health Public Service.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and strong growth in North America and Europe.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during fiscal 2018 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	We use the term pricing to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	In our consulting business, net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2018 was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media Technology, Resources, Financial Services and Products as well as strong growth in Health Public Service .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S5	In our outsourcing business, net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S6	Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2018 was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media Technology, Resources and Products, as well as strong growth in Health Public Service and modest growth in Financial Services .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S7	We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P5_S8	In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	approximately 3% higher than our revenue growth in local currency for the year.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 2.5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Utilization for fiscal 2018 was 91% , flat with fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 459,000 as of August 31, 2018 , compared to approximately 425,000 as of August 31, 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S6	Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2018 was 15% , up from 14% in fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S7	We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S8	In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S9	For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S10	We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P9_S11	Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for fiscal 2018 was 31.4% , compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to fiscal 2017 , partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.7% for fiscal 2018 , compared with 16.9% for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	For fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 20 basis points and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	During fiscal 2017 , we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P10_S6	For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for fiscal 2018 was 14.8% , compared with 13.3% for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 would have been flat with fiscal 2018 at 14.8% .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27.4% , compared with 21.3% for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) of $178 million .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Absent this charge and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 23.0% .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes described above, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have also been 23.0% .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Diluted earnings per share were $6.34 for fiscal 2018 , compared with $5.44 for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.40 in fiscal 2018 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.74 and $5.91 for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	excluding the impact of the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017 , as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our financial performance when comparing these periods.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	As described further in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), on March 13, 2018 our subsidiary Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	The merger was internal and administrative in nature.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Beginning in fiscal 2019, we are adopting new accounting standards that will affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs: Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); and ASU No. 2017-07: Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715).
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	In connection with the adoption, we will present total revenues and will no longer report revenues before reimbursements.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S5	Also, certain components of pension costs will be reclassified from operating expenses to non-operating expenses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S6	In our subsequent periodic reports, prior-period results will be revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S7	Additionally, on September 1, 2018, we will adopt ASU No. 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which will require us to record deferred tax assets of up to $2.1 billion and incremental income tax expense going forward, as these deferred tax assets are utilized.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P15_S8	For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Bookings and Backlog New bookings for fiscal 2018 were $42.81 billion , with consulting bookings of $23.63 billion and outsourcing bookings of $19.18 billion .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	New bookings involve estimates and judgments.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price we charge when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P35_S4	If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P35_S5	Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P35_S6	While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), which significantly changed U.S. tax law.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	Due to the recent enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we had previously recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S5	In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded an adjustment of $40,927 to our provisional tax expense resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S6	While we now consider our analysis of these items under the Tax Act to be complete, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P40_S7	The election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the election is made.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S4	We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S5	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S6	As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P46_S7	We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media Technology; Financial Services; Health Public Service; Products; and Resources.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Consulting net revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P50_S5	Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:
1467373_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	_______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	(1) Effective September 1, 2017, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada), Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East).
1467373_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our business in the United States represented 43% , 45% and 46% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Communications, Media Technology net revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by growth across all geographic regions in Software Platforms and Communications Media, led by Software Platforms in North America.

1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3,630 million , or 11% , over fiscal 2017 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 86.0% from 87.4% during this period .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3,515 million , or 12% , over fiscal 2017 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.2% from 86.7% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2018 increased $3,426 million , or 13% , over fiscal 2017 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.1% from 70.0% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3,311 million , or 14% , over fiscal 2017 , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.6% from 68.3% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S5	Gross margin for fiscal 2018 decreased to 31.4% from 31.7% in fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S6	The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S7	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 increased $444 million , or 12% , over fiscal 2017 , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.6% from 10.8% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P64_S8	General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2018 increased $270 million , or 13% , over fiscal 2017 , and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 6.1% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2018 increased $1,208 million , or 26% , over fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin in fiscal 2017 by 150 basis points.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for fiscal 2018 was 14.8% , flat with fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:
1467373_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	(1) Represents the pension settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2018 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 :
1467373_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Communications, Media Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Health Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower consulting contract profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	During fiscal 2018 , other expense increased $31 million over fiscal 2017 , primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27.4% , compared with 21.3% for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	In fiscal 2018 , we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S4	Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 23.0% .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S5	Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million , the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0% .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S6	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P75_S7	In addition, as described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2018 decreased $35 million , or 18% , from fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, which decreased the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $6.34 for fiscal 2018 , compared with $5.44 for fiscal 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The $0.90 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 by $0.40 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.74 and $5.91 for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, an increase of $0.83 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	This increase was due to increases of $0.82 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.05 from lower weighted average shares outstanding , partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from lower non-operating income and $0.02 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interest.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Results of Operations for Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:

1467373_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	(1) Effective September 1, 2017, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada), Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East).
1467373_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 :
1467373_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Communications, Media Technology net revenues increased 4% in local currency, led by Software Platforms in North America, as well as growth across all industry groups in Growth Markets.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	This growth was partially offset by a decline in Communications Media in Europe, as disruptions in the market continue to impact demand.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Financial Services net revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by Banking Capital Markets in Europe and Growth Markets.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Health Public Service net revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by Public Service in Growth Markets and Europe.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Products net revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by very strong growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail Travel Services, as well as Life Sciences in North America and Industrial in Europe.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency, led by Utilities in Europe, partially offset by declines in Energy across all geographic regions.

1467373_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Europe net revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as France, Spain and Switzerland.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Growth Markets net revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Singapore and China.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,146 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 86.2% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,145 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.7% from 85.4% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2017 increased $1,215 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.0% from 70.5% during this period.

1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S5	Gross margin for fiscal 2017 increased to 31.7% from 31.3% in fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S6	The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017 was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues, compared to fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S7	Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 increased $174 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.8% from 10.9% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S8	General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2017 increased $247 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.1% from 5.7% during this period.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P91_S9	The increase as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to higher technology and facilities costs, as well as higher acquisition-related costs.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

1467373_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 increased 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:
1467373_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	(1) Represents pension settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2017 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	In addition, during fiscal 2017, each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:
1467373_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Communications, Media Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Health Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower outsourcing contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenues.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Products operating income increased principally due to very strong revenue growth, as well as higher consulting contract profitability.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Resources operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenue.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	During fiscal 2017, other expense decreased $31 million from fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	Gain (Loss) on Sale of Businesses We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of $548 million and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture of $301 million during fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P102_S3	For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 21.3%, compared with 22.4% for fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0%.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	Absent the gain on sale of businesses of $849 million and related tax impact of $104 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes, other adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, and the recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P103_S4	This was partially offset by a net increase to prior-year non-U.S. tax liabilities, primarily related to a final assessment of prior-year taxes in Switzerland.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P103_S5	The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate also benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., and prior to March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	See Business Organizational Structure and History.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	The decrease was due to lower net income of $715 million, primarily driven by the pension settlement charge recorded during fiscal 2017 as well as the gain on sale of businesses recorded during fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P105_S4	Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.44 for fiscal 2017, compared with $6.45 for fiscal 2016.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P105_S5	The $1.01 decrease in our diluted earnings per share included both the impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47 and the impact of the gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P105_S6	Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $5.91 and $5.34 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.57 due to increases of $0.38 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.06 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.04 from lower non-operating expense.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	In addition, we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P107_S3	We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:
1467373_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	As of August 31, 2018 , Cash and cash equivalents were $5.1 billion , compared with $4.1 billion as of August 31, 2017 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:
1467373_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	Operating activities: The $1,054 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and lower tax disbursements, as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower spending on certain compensation payments.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities decreased $984 million due to lower spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by higher spending on property and equipment.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	Financing activities: The $149 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as the purchase of additional interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	Borrowing Facilities See Note 8 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2019 .
1467373_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P114_S2	For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	Subsequent Events See Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2018 , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
1467373_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	(1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	(2) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P119_S2	These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P119_S3	(3) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P119_S4	Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P120_S1	To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P120_S2	For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7_P120_S3	New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S5	These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Swedish krona are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S8	These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P0_S9	For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of August 31, 2018 , it was anticipated that approximately $21 million of net losses, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $483 million and $494 million as of August 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively .
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2018 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Other Market Risk The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P3_S5	We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2018 .
1467373_18_ITEM7A_P3_S6	Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and iii.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S5	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S6	Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
1467373_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

1467373_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1467373_18_ITEM10_P0_S0	There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors from those described in the proxy statement for our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders filed with the SEC on December 15, 2017.
