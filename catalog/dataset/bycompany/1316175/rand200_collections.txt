1316175_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We currently have one Phase 3 clinical program, varespladib, and two Phase 2 clinical programs, A-623 and A-001.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Two of our product candidates, varespladib and A-001, are designed to inhibit a novel enzyme target known as secretory phospholipase A 2 , or sPLA 2 .
1316175_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Elevated levels of sPLA 2 have been implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as in chronic diseases, including stable coronary artery disease, or CAD.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	In addition, A-623, a phase 2 product candidate, targets elevated levels of B-lymphocyte stimulator, or BLyS, also known as B-cell Activating Factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, lupus nephritis, or LN, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sj gren s Syndrome, Graves Disease and others.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware in 2004.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 25801 Industrial Boulevard, Suite B, Hayward, California 94545 and our telephone number is (510) 856-5600.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	We have worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our products in all indications and markets, with the exception of Japan where Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains commercial rights to our sPLA 2 product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our current development plans are focused on acute treatment and orphan indications that may provide an accelerated and cost-efficient path to regulatory approval and commercialization.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	We believe that certain of these markets can be commercialized through a limited specialty sales force.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	In addition, we believe that our product candidates can also address market opportunities in chronic indications and we may seek development and commercialization partners to address chronic, non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	The inflammatory process is a powerful and essential early line of defense for protection against injury and to repair body tissue.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	As a result, it is tightly regulated by the body to ensure appropriate activation and prompt resolution.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	However, under certain circumstances, the normal process can malfunction, leading to acute or chronic inflammation or inappropriate activation directed against the body s own tissues.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	All of these circumstances can cause significant damage to cells and tissues, leading to a range of inflammatory disorders, such as cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Building upon our knowledge of the regulation of inflammatory pathways and the growing body of evidence that links inflammation to multiple disease states, we believe that we have developed a leadership position in the field of sPLA 2 inhibition.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our sPLA 2 inhibitors have been studied in a number of inflammatory disorders in multiple therapeutic areas.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	The effect of our sPLA 2 inhibitors on sPLA 2 concentration and activity have been implicated in acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	We currently have the two most advanced sPLA 2 inhibitors in clinical development.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our lead product candidate, varespladib (an oral prodrug of A-001), is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of sPLA 2 enzymes and is being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical study for short-term (16-week) treatment of patients who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	The American Heart Association defines acute coronary syndrome as any group of clinical symptoms related to acute myocardial ischemia, including unstable angina, or UA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Varespladib, when combined with Lipitor (atorvastatin), is one of only a few therapeutics in development with the potential to offer a unique and synergistic treatment approach targeting inflammation, elevated lipid levels and atherosclerosis as part of physician-directed standard of care.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Through its novel mechanism of action, varespladib may have applications in a broad range of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Based on the successful results of our completed Phase 2b clinical study, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical study, VISTA-16, in patients with acute coronary syndrome in June 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our second product candidate, varespladib sodium, A-001, is an intravenously administered inhibitor of sPLA 2 ,which we are planning to evaluate in a Phase 2 clinical study for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Acute chest syndrome is a form of inflammation-induced lung failure and is the most common cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	Given that there are currently no approved drugs for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, we have received orphan drug designation and fast track status from the FDA for A-001.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	We also have a broad series of additional sPLA 2 inhibitors designed with distinct chemical scaffolds in preclinical development.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	These product candidates are intended to provide new sPLA 2 inhibitors for our existing target indications as well as new candidates for other therapeutic areas.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our lead candidate within the series, A-003, is chemically distinct from A-001 and varespladib and has shown increased potency against the target enzymes and higher drug exposure after dosing in preclinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	As a result, A-003 may confer beneficial pharmacodynamic effects in patients and can be formulated for oral or intravenously administered use.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	We plan to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, for A-003 in the future and we may continue to assess additional new compounds.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have explored the use of our varespladib and A-001 sPLA 2 inhibitors as both topical and inhalation therapies in animal models for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and asthma, respectively.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	In a sheep model of allergen-induced asthma, inhaled A-001 demonstrated an improvement in lung function similar to inhaled steroids.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	sPLA 2 is a family of enzymes directly involved in the acute and chronic steps of an inflammatory response.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	sPLA 2 activity is highly elevated during the early stages of inflammation, and its acute effects serve to substantially amplify the inflammatory process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	The sPLA 2 enzyme catalyzes the first step in the arachidonic acid pathway of inflammation, one of the main metabolic processes for the production of inflammatory mediators, which, when amplified, are responsible for causing damage to cells and tissue.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Specifically, sPLA 2 breaks down phospholipids that result in the formation of fatty acids such as arachidonic acid.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	Arachidonic acid is subsequently metabolized to form several pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic molecules.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	In cardiovascular diseases such as acute coronary syndrome, elevated levels of sPLA 2 mass and sPLA 2 activity have acute and chronic implications on disease progression and patient outcomes.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	In published studies and our own clinical studies, significant elevations in sPLA 2 activity and mass have been seen from 24 hours to two weeks following an acute coronary syndrome and can persist for up to an additional 12 weeks thereafter.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Shortly after a heart attack, sPLA 2 is dramatically elevated, amplifying inflammation that is associated with more frequent and secondary cardiovascular events.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	This resulting elevated level of inflammation is problematic for acute coronary syndrome patients who are already at higher risk of complications during the weeks following their initial event.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	For example, increased inflammation can destabilize vulnerable vascular lesions or atherosclerotic plaque, destroy damaged but viable cardiac cells and adversely modify lipids, any of which may lead to the recurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Historical and recent clinical results have demonstrated circulating levels of sPLA 2 are significantly correlated with a well-established inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, or CRP.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	These and other clinical studies have also demonstrated that sPLA 2 independently predicts coronary events in patients that have recently experienced an acute coronary syndrome and patients with stable CAD independent of other standard risk factors.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	In a stable cardiovascular patient, sPLA 2 not only sustains chronic vascular inflammation as discussed earlier, but it also adversely remodels lipoproteins such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C. sPLA 2 interacts with LDL-C in a series of reactions that result in smaller, more pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory LDL-C particles.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Moreover, these modified lipoproteins have a reduced affinity for LDL-C receptors, which are responsible for removal of cholesterol from the body.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	As a result, LDL-C remains in circulation longer and has a greater tendency to deposit in the artery wall.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	This increased LDL-C deposition and sustained chronic vascular inflammation may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The family of sPLA 2 enzymes includes at least three forms that play a role in inflammation and the development of cardiovascular disease or lung injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	While sPLA 2 enzymes are a member of the phospholipase family that includes a lipoprotein associated phospholipase A 2 , or Lp-PLA 2 , there are important distinctions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Although both are present in blood, Lp-PLA 2 is mostly bound to LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, while sPLA 2 enzymes are not.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	Based on our clinical studies, we believe that our sPLA 2 inhibitor, varespladib, can be distinguished from other PLA 2 enzyme inhibitors such as those targeted at inhibiting Lp-PLA 2 because varespladib treatment:
1316175_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	reduces plaque volume and aneurysms in standard rodent models of atherosclerosis and has demonstrated synergistic reductions of plaque volume in standard rodent models of atherosclerosis when used in combination with statins.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	In diseases such as acute chest syndrome, a very serious form of lung injury associated with sickle cell disease, sPLA 2 acts acutely on a number of substrates that amplify the inflammatory disease process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder which leads to the structural alteration, or sickling, of otherwise healthy red blood cells.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	Patients with sickle cell disease experience periods of intense pain known as vaso-occlusive crisis, or VOC, as structurally altered red blood cells bind together and occlude small blood vessels that supply blood and nutrients to vital tissue and bone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	sPLA 2 levels are dramatically elevated in sickle cell patients during an episode of VOC as well as within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of acute chest syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	During VOC, microscopic fat emboli, or droplets of fat from the bone marrow, are prevalent and can break free and become lodged in the lung.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	These emboli are substrates for sPLA 2 enzymes and provide fuel for an already established inflammatory response, increasing lung injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, sPLA 2 has been demonstrated to degrade human lung surfactant, a component necessary in maintaining appropriate lung function, which further complicates lung injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	We believe that early intervention with a drug designed to inhibit sPLA 2 activity may offer a unique opportunity to reduce the complications associated with certain inflammatory diseases such as acute coronary syndrome in cardiovascular patients and acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	BAFF has been associated with a wide range of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases including lupus, LN, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sj gren s Syndrome, Graves Disease and others.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The role of BAFF in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has recently been validated in multiple clinical studies with other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	We are advancing the development of our BAFF inhibitor molecule, A-623, a selective peptibody, to exploit its broad potential clinical utility in autoimmune diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	We have worldwide rights to A-623 in all potential indications.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	We have initiated PEARL-SC, the Phase 2b clinical study of A-623, for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Lupus patients suffer from a chronic autoimmune disease, which often leads to severe skin rash, fatigue, joint pain, major organ complications and cardiovascular disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	A-623 demonstrates anti-BAFF activity and has shown statistically significant reductions in B-cells in two Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with lupus.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	We believe A-623 may offer a number of potential differentiations over other BAFF antagonists, as well as other novel B-cell directed therapies including:
1316175_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	multiple binding domains achieve highest reported affinity for inhibition of BAFF.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	We have focused our product development programs on anti-inflammatory therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases, lupus and other serious diseases for which we believe that current treatments are either inadequate or non-existent.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our current product development programs are listed in the table below.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	We have historically spent a significant portion of our capital resources on research and development.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our research and development expenses were $29.5, $8.4 and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Varespladib is an orally administered pro-drug of A-001, which is a broad-spectrum, once-daily inhibitor of the IIa, V and X iso-forms of the sPLA 2 enzyme that has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and lipid-modulating treatment effects in multiple clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	evaluate varespladib in combination with atorvastatin therapy, specifically Lipitor, for the short-term (16-week) treatment of acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	We have an agreement with the FDA on a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA for the VISTA-16 study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	An SPA provides an opportunity for the clinical study sponsor to receive feedback from the FDA regarding the potential adequacy of a clinical study to meet certain regulatory and scientific requirements if conducted in accordance with the SPA agreement.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	An SPA is not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	To date, over 1,000 patients and healthy volunteers in at least 15 previous clinical studies have been exposed to varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Varespladib was generally well-tolerated in studies where patients were exposed to a maximum of 48 weeks of therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Varespladib has been studied in combination with Lipitor (atorvastatin) in a Phase 2b clinical study in acute coronary syndrome patients and two earlier Phase 2 clinical studies in stable CAD patients, the majority of whom were on various statin therapies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	We currently have all worldwide product rights to varespladib, except in Japan where Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	We originally licensed our sPLA 2 inhibitor portfolio, including varespladib and A-001, from Eli Lilly Company, or Eli Lilly, and Shionogi Co., Ltd. in July 2006.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	According to the American Heart Association, over 18 million people in the United States have experienced an acute coronary syndrome and an estimated 1.5 million Americans will have a new or recurrent heart attack.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	In addition, the American Heart Association estimates that worldwide, cardiovascular disease kills an estimated 17.5 million people each year.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	According to British Heart Foundation statistics, CAD, which often leads to acute coronary syndrome or heart attacks, accounts for 1.9 million deaths in Europe annually.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	According to the World Health Organization, or the WHO, cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the western world and a major cause of hospital admissions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	In addition, the American Heart Association provides that for people over the age of 40, 20% of them will die within one year following an initial heart attack, and over one-third of them will die within the first five years of an initial heart attack.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	These numbers are expected to increase given an aging population, as well as the rising epidemics of diabetes and obesity, two conditions known to increase the risk of acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	The American Heart Association defines acute coronary syndrome as any group of clinical signs and symptoms related to acute myocardial ischemia.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Acute myocardial ischemia can often present as chest pain due to insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle that results from CAD.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Acute coronary syndrome covers a spectrum of clinical conditions that include ST-elevated myocardial infarction, or STEMI, non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction, or NSTEMI, and UA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	Both STEMI and NSTEMI are forms of a heart attack, where damage to the heart muscle occurs due to ischemia, which is lack of blood flow to tissues due to a blockage of a vessel.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	Typically, UA results in chest pain from ischemia, but does not cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Furthermore, for any patient who experiences an acute coronary syndrome, the risk of a secondary MACE is significantly increased immediately following the initial event.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Large clinical outcome studies such as MIRACL and PROVE-IT have previously reported, and data from our own FRANCIS Phase 2b clinical study supports, the 16-week rate of secondary MACE in acute coronary syndrome patients to be between 6.1% and 14.8%.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	Current treatments for CAD other than interventional procedures include a variety of medications such as aspirin, statins and anti-platelet and anti-coagulant therapeutics.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	These medications are used to offer both acute and chronic benefits to patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	For patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, therapeutics are administered quickly to improve blood flow to the heart and limit the risk associated with continued ischemia and thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot inside a vessel, which obstructs blood flow.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	In addition, interventional procedures and other medications, such as statins that are initiated early primarily for lipid benefits, are continued in an attempt to provide chronic protection against secondary MACE through improvement in lipid profiles such as lowering LDL-C.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	In patients experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, the relationship between higher levels of inflammation, as measured by CRP, sPLA 2 and interleukin-6, or IL-6, and increased risk for MACE has been demonstrated extensively.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	We believe, if our Phase 3 pivotal study is successful, that varespladib, if approved by the FDA, would represent the first anti-inflammatory therapeutic approved for prevention of MACE.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	CRP is one of the most commonly used marker of inflammation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	It has been correlated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in multiple clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Although a causative role for CRP has not been established, inflammation is known to promote acute coronary syndrome and CRP may play a direct role in both vascular inflammation as well as plaque rupture.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Statins reduce the level of CRP and other markers of inflammation in patients with stable CAD.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	In April 2001, the Journal of the American Medical Association published results from the MIRACL study describing the effect of statins in acute coronary syndrome, where inflammation is greatly elevated.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	3,086 were randomized within 96 hours of their index event to treatment with high-dose Lipitor (atorvastatin) or placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Lipitor (atorvastatin) significantly reduced secondary MACE after 16 weeks.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	A second paper from the same study, published in Circulation in 2003, described the rapid decline of inflammatory markers in patients on statin treatment that was associated with reduced MACE.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	After 16 weeks, Lipitor (atorvastatin) reduced CRP levels by 34%.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	More recently, in 2005, the New England Journal of Medicine published data from the PROVE-IT study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	A total of 3,745 patients were randomized to either intensive statin therapy with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) or moderate statin therapy with 40 mg pravastatin.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	Patients with low CRP or LDL-C had fewer MACE than those with higher levels of either CRP or LDL-C. Patients who had both LDL-C 70 mg/dL and CRP 1 mg/L had the fewest number of secondary events overall.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	The direct relationship between lower LDL-C levels and reduced risk for major cardiovascular events has been consistently demonstrated for over a decade in 18 outcome studies involving over 119,000 patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	Results from large clinical outcome studies demonstrate achieving incrementally lower LDL-C levels reduces the risk of future cardiovascular events and provides continued patient benefit.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	As a result, the lipid treatment guidelines have been revised to establish more aggressive LDL-C treatment goals over time.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P65_S3	The most recent guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program s Adult Treatment Panel III, or NCEP ATP III, updated in 2004 advocate treatment goals for LDL-C below 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients and 70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P65_S4	Given the breadth of more recent clinical data available, we believe that future treatment guidelines from the NCEP will likely establish new LDL-C treatment goals that apply the 70 mg/dL standard or lower to a broader population of at-risk patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Patients enrolled in our FRANCIS Phase 2b clinical study and our planned Phase 3 acute coronary syndrome study represent high-risk patients as defined by the NCEP.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	III guideline categories of high-risk and very high-risk do not achieve these recommended lipid goals despite maximum lipid-lowering therapies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Moreover, substantial residual risk remains even among the group of patients who do achieve these aggressive LDL-C goals suggesting additional biological mechanisms, including inflammation, may be relevant.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	This is exemplified in a November 2008 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine that detailed the results from a 17,000 patient, multinational, primary prevention study named JUPITER.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	The study randomized patients with relatively normal levels of LDL-C, but elevated levels of inflammation based on CRP, to statin or placebo therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	The JUPITER study was stopped early because those patients randomized to statin therapy demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in CRP, which also translated to a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events versus those on placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P68_S3	The reduction in events was well in excess of that which would be predicted from historical data evaluating LDL-C reductions alone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P68_S4	While these results were generated in a primary prevention setting, we believe that the benefits of reducing inflammation may prove to be even more meaningful in settings where patients are in a hyper-inflammatory state, such as following an acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P68_S5	As a result of these studies, we believe that there is a substantial need for novel therapies that provide meaningful reductions in inflammation while also improving LDL-C levels in high-risk cardiovascular patients beyond the benefits of statin therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P68_S6	Therefore, it is our belief that targeting inflammation and elevated LDL-C with sPLA 2 inhibition during the early phase of an acute coronary syndrome will further improve patient outcomes.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	We believe that varespladib is one of only a few novel drugs in development with the potential to offer a clinical benefit to high-risk cardiovascular patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Varespladib s unique mechanism provides potent anti-inflammatory activity, as measured by reductions in sPLA 2 , CRP and IL-6; incremental lipid-lowering activity, as measured by LDL-C; and lipid-modulating activity beyond that achievable with statin therapy alone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	Furthermore, because of their complementary mechanisms, we believe that the combination of statins and varespladib can provide synergistic anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering benefits.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	We also have preliminary data to suggest that varespladib may be synergistic with other cardiovascular therapeutic regimens, such as niacin.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	In 2008, based on the results from Phase 2 stable CAD studies, as discussed below, we met with the FDA to discuss the next steps of clinical development of varespladib during our end of Phase 2 meeting.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	As a result of that meeting and the results from our Phase 2b acute coronary syndrome study, we submitted an SPA to the FDA for the Phase 3 VISTA-16 study of varespladib for the short-term (16-week) treatment of patients who have recently experienced an acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	We reached agreement with the FDA on all aspects of the VISTA-16 study protocol, including patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, study size, statistical considerations, efficacy endpoints, study duration, randomization and lipid management strategies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	An independent DSMB will continually evaluate the performance of the VISTA-16 study over time to ensure patient safety.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	In addition, after a minimum of 1,000 patients have been enrolled in the VISTA-16 study, an independent statistician not involved with the conduct of the VISTA-16 study will conduct a biomarker analysis to ensure patient levels of inflammation, as measured by sPLA 2 , CRP and IL-6, and lipid profiles, as measured by LDL-C, have met pre-specified reductions versus placebo at various time-points.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	These markers of inflammation and lipid profiles are established in the clinical community and pharmaceutical industry as independent predictors of cardiovascular risk and, if positive, will provide additional validation of our previous findings from the FRANCIS Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P72_S3	At the same time, the independent DSMB will review all clinical data from the VISTA-16 study to ensure no emergent adverse safety signals.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	In June 2010, we initiated enrollment in the VISTA-16 clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	Pursuant to our SPA agreement with the FDA, our multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 acute coronary syndrome VISTA-16 study will enroll up to 6,500 patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	We anticipate the study will be conducted in up to 15 countries and up to 500 centers.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	However, enrollment may be stopped anytime after a minimum of 385 adjudicated endpoint events as described in the protocol have occurred.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	This number of events could allow us to detect a treatment effect on the composite endpoint as low as 18.1% with a p-value of less than 0.05.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P73_S5	We may increase the sample size if the adjudicated endpoint events occur at a lower rate than we expect.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Patients will be randomized at entry to receive 16 weeks of either 500 mg once-daily of varespladib or placebo in addition to a 20, 40 or 80 milligram dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	The dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin) may be adjusted after eight weeks if the patient s LDL-C level remains above 100 mg/dL. Survival status will be obtained for patients six months after the completion of dosing.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	The clinical study will attempt to recruit a similar population of high-risk cardiovascular patients with acute coronary syndrome to those enrolled in the FRANCIS study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	As in FRANCIS, randomization must occur within 96 hours of hospitalization for the acute coronary syndrome event, or if already hospitalized, within 96 hours of event diagnosis.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	Patient blood chemistry will be evaluated at baseline, 24 hours and weeks one, two, four, eight and 16.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	Randomization is being stratified by the presence or absence of lipid-lowering therapy prior to the index event as well as the type of acute coronary syndrome event, such as UA, NSTEMI or STEMI.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	The number of subjects who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention following the index event and prior to randomization will be limited to no more than 55% of the total patient population.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	The primary endpoint of the VISTA-16 study is to determine whether 16 weeks of once-daily treatment with varespladib plus a dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin) is superior to placebo plus Lipitor (atorvastatin) in the time to the first occurrence of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or documented UA with objective evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization as defined by recent FDA draft guidance.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	On July 22, 2009, the Center for Drug Education and Research division of the FDA issued draft recommendations for standardized definitions for cardiovascular outcomes trials.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	The VISTA-16 clinical study endpoint definitions conform to these guidelines.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	A secondary endpoint for the VISTA-16 study is to determine whether varespladib plus a dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin) is superior to placebo plus Lipitor (atorvastatin) in the time to the first occurrence of the combined endpoint of all cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or documented UA with objective evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	A comparison between treatment groups will also be made for each component of the primary efficacy endpoint.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	Additionally, the time to multiple occurrences of any non-fatal component of the composite primary endpoint will also be explored.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P79_S3	The biomarkers CRP, IL-6, LDL-C and sPLA 2 will also be evaluated at each time point of the clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	In July 2008, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical study that enrolled 625 acute coronary syndrome patients across 35 centers in three countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	Given the drug s combined anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and lipid-modulating effects, we evaluated the effects of varespladib in acute coronary syndrome patients with high levels of inflammation and dislipidemia.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P80_S2	The clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of varespladib when co-administered with the highest dose (80 mg) of Lipitor (atorvastatin).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P80_S3	The clinical study randomized all patients to a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with either 500 mg once-daily of varespladib or placebo in combination with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) and physician-directed standard of care.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had a diagnosis of UA, NSTEMI or STEMI.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	In addition, they must have had one of the following risk factors: diabetes, body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2, CRP 2 mg/L (NSTEMI/STEMI) or CRP 3 mg/L (UA) and presence of three (pre-defined) characteristics of metabolic syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	Subjects must have been randomized within 96 hours of hospital admission for the index event, or, if already hospitalized, within 96 hours of index event diagnosis.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	Any percutaneous revascularization was required to occur prior to randomization.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P81_S4	In addition, because we wanted to assess the effects of varespladib with the highest available dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin), patients were not allowed to use any other lipid-lowering therapies during the clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P81_S5	Follow-up visits for evaluation occurred post-randomization at weeks two, four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24 and then monthly thereafter until clinical study completion.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P81_S6	All enrolled subjects remained on treatment until all subjects had been treated for a minimum of 24 weeks or until the occurrence of MACE.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Patients randomized into the FRANCIS study had baseline characteristics such as LDL-C indexed-event risk factors and demographics similar to other studies of this type.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	All patients who completed the clinical study received a final evaluation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	The primary efficacy endpoint evaluated the change in LDL-C after 500 patients completed eight weeks of treatment.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	LDL-C is the most widely recognized surrogate for predicting cardiovascular risk where percentage reductions in LDL-C have been highly correlated with reductions in future cardiovascular risk.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	the occurrence of secondary MACE (for purposes of this clinical study, all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, documented UA requiring urgent hospitalization, revascularization occurring 60 days post the index event or non-fatal stroke).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	Results of the primary endpoint demonstrated a statistically significant incremental LDL-C reduction of 5.7% (p = 0.0023) in varespladib treated patients versus those treated with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) alone after eight weeks of therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	A p-value is a probability with a value ranging from 0 to 1, which indicates the likelihood that a clinical study is different between treatment and control groups.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	A statistically significant difference was observed in LDL-C reduction from baseline as early as two weeks after treatment.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	The treatment effect was maintained throughout the observation period.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Secondary endpoints measured effects of varespladib on sPLA 2 , CRP and IL-6 levels, which are well-established markers of inflammation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	While the FRANCIS study was not designed to demonstrate statistically significant changes in CRP and IL-6, the results were consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated improvement across these biomarkers and achieved statistical significance at some time points.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	sPLA 2 concentration was statistically significantly reduced from the earliest time point of two weeks through the 16-week time point (p 0.0001) as compared to high-dose statin (80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin)) therapy alone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	While our first sPLA 2 measurement in this clinical study occurred at two weeks, data from previous clinical studies utilizing varespladib or A-001 demonstrated reductions in sPLA 2 as early as two days following treatment.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	In addition, treatment-related reductions in CRP and IL-6 levels were also greater in varespladib treated patients compared to those treated with placebo at all time points in the clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	The percent decrease in CRP at week two was nearly two-fold greater among varespladib and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) treated patients than those treated with placebo and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) alone (-39% versus -20%, p = 0.183), and at week 16, the difference between treatment groups was statistically significant (-82% versus -73%, p = 0.0067).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P90_S2	At weeks two, four, eight and 16, varespladib treated patients had numerically reduced levels of CRP versus patients treated with placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	The percent decrease in IL-6 in patients on varespladib at week two was more than three times the reduction in IL-6 in patients on placebo (-18% versus -5.1%, p = 0.18).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Treatment with varespladib resulted in more subjects with LDL-C levels lower than 70 mg/dL and lower than 50 mg/dL than those on placebo (80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) and physician-directed standard of care) alone at eight, 16 and 24 weeks of treatment.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	As discussed above, the NCEP ATP III guidelines have established an LDL-C of 70 mg/dL as an optional target for very high-risk patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	As indicated in the table below, the data suggests varespladib treatment helps patients achieve their LDL-C target levels more quickly and maintain them longer than with high-dose statin (80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin)) therapy alone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Finally, given the importance of reducing inflammation as well as LDL-C following an acute coronary syndrome event, we examined the proportion of patients in the clinical study that were able to achieve both LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL and CRP levels below 1 mg/L.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	Significantly more patients at week four and week 16 (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01) reached this combined target when treated with varespladib and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) than with placebo and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) alone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P94_S2	(The actual proportion of subjects in the varespladib group was 25% and 16% in the placebo group).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P94_S3	Additionally, in the PROVE-IT study a comparable proportion (16%) of patients treated with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) achieved these goals.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	We also conducted an exploratory analysis of MACE in the clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	At 16 weeks, there were 14 (4.2%) MACE in the varespladib treated group as compared to 19 (6.1%) in the placebo group.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	At the completion of the clinical study, all patients had received at least six months of therapy and there were 23 (7.4%) MACE in the varespladib treated group as compared to 24 (7.7%) MACE in the placebo group.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P95_S3	While the MACE analysis was not designed to demonstrate any statistical differences between the two treatment groups, we believe that the results are encouraging and has helped us to design our VISTA-16 study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	Overall, varespladib was generally well-tolerated in this clinical study and no imbalance was seen in dropouts due to drug effects.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	After completing patient treatment, overall exposure to varespladib was a mean of 30 weeks and median of 34 weeks.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	In total, 485 total patients completed six months of treatment, with 167 subjects completing 40 weeks and 70 completing 44 weeks.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P96_S3	There was no imbalance of overall adverse events between the treatment arms.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P96_S4	During the clinical study, at week four and week eight, occasional mild and transient elevations in liver enzymes, defined as elevations three times the upper limit of normal, were seen among more patients taking varespladib, but the frequency and magnitude of the elevations were not meaningfully different between the active and control groups at the end of the clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P96_S5	The frequency of the elevations was also similar to that reported for Lipitor (atorvastatin) and other currently approved lipid-lowering agents.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P96_S6	Furthermore, there were no effects on blood pressure or the QT interval, an electro-cardiographic safety endpoint.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	Summary data from FRANCIS was presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in 2010 and the detailed results from the study were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in September 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	Our Phase 2 PLASMA study was designed to confirm the safety and effect of varespladib on sPLA 2 concentration, other inflammatory biomarkers and lipids in patients with stable CAD.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	In October 2007, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating four doses of varespladib administered twice-daily versus placebo among 396 patients with stable CAD from 38 centers in two countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	The clinical study enrolled patients more than 12 weeks after a myocardial infarction or six weeks after an episode of UA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P99_S2	The varespladib doses tested were 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg administered twice per day.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P99_S3	Following randomization, patients were treated for eight weeks and safety and efficacy evaluations were conducted at weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P99_S4	Physician-directed standard of care therapies were permitted during the clinical study, including 259 patients who were on background statin therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	The primary endpoint of the clinical study was the change in sPLA 2 concentration from baseline to week eight in varespladib, across all doses, versus placebo patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	Secondary endpoints in the clinical study included the change in lipids, including LDL-C, lipoprotein subclasses and certain inflammatory biomarkers, from baseline to each of weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our Phase 2 PLASMA results were selected for a late-breaking presentation at the American Cardiology Conference and published in the Lancet journal in February 2009.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	Results from the clinical study demonstrated that treatment with varespladib led to statistically significant reductions in sPLA 2 , LDL-C and various plaque-building and pro-inflammatory forms of LDL-C. In patients receiving varespladib, there were incremental reductions in CRP versus placebo (-55.6% versus -24.8%, p = 0.47) from baseline to eight weeks.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	Among all patients treated with varespladib, median sPLA 2 concentration decreased by 86.7% from baseline to week eight, as compared to 4.8% in the placebo group (p 0.0001).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	Median sPLA 2 concentration decreased among the varespladib groups in a dose-dependent manner.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	At week eight, across all dosage groups, LDL-C was reduced by 9.7% versus placebo (p = 0.0035).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	In a subgroup of patients taking statins with LDL-C 70 mg/dL, LDL-C was reduced by 12.0% (p = 0.0065) versus placebo at the eight week time point.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P103_S2	Notably, the reductions in LDL-C appear to be driven primarily by a shift in the distribution of LDL-C particles with fewer pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory small LDL-C particles present in the circulation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P103_S3	In addition, statistically significant reductions from baseline to week eight were seen in total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in the overall clinical study population treated with varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	Varespladib was generally well-tolerated among all patients treated.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P104_S1	In general, adverse effects were mild or moderate with no imbalance of adverse events in the varespladib groups as compared to placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P104_S2	The most common adverse effects seen in the varespladib groups were headache (6.4%) and nausea (5.4%).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P104_S3	There were mild and transient elevations of liver function tests, defined as elevations three times the upper limit of normal, in patients taking varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	Based on data from our first PLASMA study, we initiated a second Phase 2 clinical study (PLASMA-2) to evaluate the effect of once-daily varespladib treatment on inflammatory and lipid biomarkers.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	In December 2007, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study evaluating two doses of varespladib versus placebo amongst 138 patients with stable CAD.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	The clinical study, conducted in the United States, involved 13 clinical sites.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P106_S2	Following randomization to one of two doses of varespladib or placebo, patients were treated for eight weeks with safety and efficacy evaluations at weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P106_S3	Physician-directed standard of care therapies were permitted during the clinical study, including 123 patients (89.1%) who were on background statin therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	The primary endpoint of the clinical study was a comparison between once-daily doses of varespladib and placebo in changes in sPLA 2 concentration at week eight.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	Secondary endpoints in the clinical study included measurements of lipids including LDL-C and certain other inflammatory biomarkers from baseline to each of weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Results of the primary endpoint, sPLA 2 , were statistically significant and consistent with those generated from the first PLASMA study described above.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	Patients on varespladib demonstrated a 77.8% reduction in sPLA 2 concentration as compared to an increase of 8.3% in placebo treated patients (p 0.0001).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P108_S2	Pharmacokinetic data indicated that once-daily dosing with varespladib would be sufficient to achieve over 90% inhibition of sPLA 2 mass and activity over a 24-hour period.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	The anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and lipid-modulating effects of varespladib treatment were consistent with those seen in the first PLASMA study: LDL-C was decreased by 8.3% compared to 0.7% in placebo (p = 0.014).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	Due to the small size of this clinical study and the low baseline inflammation present in these patients, no meaningful changes with CRP could be detected between the active and control groups.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	As was observed in the first clinical study, there were statistically significant reductions from baseline to week eight in total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in the overall clinical study population treated with varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	The adverse effect profile for varespladib was consistent with earlier studies and there was no imbalance of adverse events among the varespladib groups and placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	The most common effects seen in the varespladib groups were diarrhea (6.7%), nausea (5.6%), any increase in alanine aminotransferase (5.6%), which is an enzyme that indicates liver cell injury, and any increase in aspartate aminotransferase (5.6%), which is another enzyme that indicates liver cell injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P111_S2	However, mild and transient elevations of these liver enzymes, defined as elevations three times the upper limit of normal, were infrequent in patients taking varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	Investigator-Sponsored Phase 2 Percutaneous Intervention Study SPIDER-PCI (sPLA 2 ) Inhibition to Decrease Enzyme Release After PCI): Varespladib Once-Daily Versus Placebo for up to 10 Days.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	In May 2007, Dr. Vladimir Dzavik at University Health Network Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada initiated an investigator sponsored study with varespladib in patients undergoing a percutaneous intervention, or PCI.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P113_S1	The primary endpoint of this study was to determine if inhibition of sPLA 2 with varespladib will result in a decrease in peri-PCI myocardial necrosis, or heart muscle damage, as measured by elevations of myocardial enzyme markers creatine kinase-MB, or CK-MB, or troponin I.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P113_S2	The study was to enroll a maximum of 164 patients who were scheduled to undergo PCI.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	Elevated levels of troponin I following PCI are associated with an increase in in-hospital complications and, in one study, were an independent predictor of major cardiac events.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P114_S1	After PCI, circulating levels of sPLA 2 increase and patients with higher levels have an increased risk of events after a two-year follow-up.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P114_S2	This study explores the notion that sPLA 2 inhibition may reduce myocardial damage after PCI and improve patient outcomes.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	As of August 2009, enrollment and dosing in the SPIDER-PCI investigator study were completed with 144 patients evaluated for purposes of assessing the primary endpoint.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P115_S1	On December 11, 2009, we received a statistical analysis of the patient evaluations, which showed that the primary endpoint of the study, a reduction in the elevation of CK-MB or troponin I above the upper limit of normal at six to eight hours or 18 to 24 hours, was not met (varespladib patients 57% versus placebo patients 51%, p = 0.55).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	Consistent with results from other clinical studies with varespladib, there were numerical reductions in CRP from baseline versus placebo at three to five days (-82.1%, p = 0.23).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	Previous Experience at Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. previously conducted a series of clinical studies evaluating varespladib and A-001 in various inflammatory conditions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P118_S1	In total, at least 17 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies evaluated varespladib and A-001 as a treatment in sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P118_S2	Results from these studies provide a large body of safety data for varespladib and A-001 with more than 1,000 healthy volunteers and subjects receiving treatment.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	Throughout these studies, varespladib was generally well-tolerated.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	Approximately 150 preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies have been completed with varespladib and A-001, including two-year rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies, one-year primate study and three-month rat study in combination with Lipitor (atorvastatin).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	A-623 is a peptibody antagonist of the BAFF cytokine that is initially being developed as a treatment for lupus.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	BLyS, also known as B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of B-cells.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	It is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	The BAFF-R receptor is expressed primarily on peripheral B-cells.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	Two randomized, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical studies for A-623 in 104 lupus patients have already been completed.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	Results from these studies demonstrated A-623 generated anti-BAFF activity and showed statistically significant reductions in B-cells of 50-70% (p 0.001) in lupus patients across multiple subcutaneous and intravenous formulations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	After successfully reactivating our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study with A-623 for the treatment of lupus in July 2010 called PEARL-SC.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P125_S1	We may also study A-623 in other B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as Sj gren s Syndrome or orphan indications such as myasthenia gravis and pemphigus.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P126_S0	We are actively pursuing a partnership with major pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P127_S0	We intend to advance the development of our BAFF targeting molecule, A-623, a selective peptibody, to exploit its broad clinical utility in autoimmune diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P127_S1	A-623, as a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture versus antibodies that are produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P127_S2	In addition, A-623 offers a number of potential differentiations over other anti-BAFF compounds, as well as other novel B-cell directed therapies, including:
1316175_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	multiple binding domains achieve highest reported affinity for inhibition of BAFF.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P129_S0	Lupus is an autoimmune disorder that involves inflammation that causes swelling, pain and tissue damage throughout the body.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P129_S1	Lupus can affect any part of the body, but especially the skin, heart, brain, lungs, joints and the kidneys.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P129_S2	The course of the disease is unpredictable, with periods of illness, called flares alternating with remission.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P130_S0	The Lupus Foundation estimates that approximately 1.5 million people in the United States and five million worldwide suffer from lupus.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P130_S1	Although lupus may affect people of either sex, women are 10 times more likely to suffer from the disease than men, according to the Lupus Foundation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P131_S0	Patients with active lupus may have a broad range of symptoms related to the inflammation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P131_S1	Inflammation of the brain may cause seizures and other neurologic abnormalities.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P131_S2	Inflammation of the heart may cause heart failure or sudden death.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P131_S3	Lung inflammation causes shortness of breath.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P131_S4	Lupus may also cause swollen joints and severe rash.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P131_S5	In addition, LN may lead to requiring kidney dialysis or transplantation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P132_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production are known to be central to the process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P132_S1	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF plays an important role in this disease process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P132_S2	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P132_S3	In addition, treatment of these same mice with BAFF antagonists appears to ameliorate the disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P133_S0	Based on positive results among 104 patients in our Phase 1a and 1b clinical studies, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus patients called PEARL-SC.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P133_S1	PEARL-SC is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2b clinical study which may enroll up to 600 patients in approximately 90 centers worldwide.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P133_S2	Subjects will be randomized into three active subcutaneous treatment arms and one placebo treatment arm for a minimum of 24 weeks.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P133_S3	The primary endpoint of the PEARL-SC study will be clinical improvement at 24 weeks in responder rates of a composite systemic lupus erythematosus responder index, or SRI, in the pooled treatment arms versus placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P133_S4	The primary SRI endpoint is a composite score based upon changes in SELENA and SLEDAI disease activity scale, Physician s Global Assessment scores and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group scores, which are clinical standards for the measurement of disease severity in lupus patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P133_S5	Secondary endpoints will include safety, improvement in other clinical assessment scores, clinical response in patients with various baseline disease severities, resolution of fatigue, steroid utilization and time to flare.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P133_S6	An interim biomarker analysis to establish the appropriate drug effect on total B-cells is included early in the study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P134_S0	Initially we intend to randomize only 540 patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P134_S1	This total number of patients will potentially allow us to detect a treatment effect of 14% with a p-value of 0.05 between the pooled active arms and the placebo arm.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P135_S0	In November 2010, we placed a voluntary hold on the PEARL-SC study due to problems found with vials.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P135_S1	Patient enrollment in the study was temporarily suspended and dosing was discontinued in patients who were enrolled in the study while we conducted an analysis of the problem.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P135_S2	We resolved the issues found with the vials in December 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P135_S3	After analysis, simulation and consultation with industry experts, we determined that shipping on dry ice was the root cause of the issue.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P135_S4	Shipping logistics were modified and we reinitiated enrollment in PEARL-SC and dosing in January 2011.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P135_S5	We have received no reports of patient-related side effects or problems with drug administration that could be attributed to the vial problem.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P136_S0	In May 2010, we successfully completed a manufacturing campaign for a high concentration A-623 injection formulation for subcutaneous administration.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P136_S1	Manufacturing was conducted per current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and the product was released to clinical sites in July 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P136_S2	In August 2010, we manufactured a second batch of vials of the high-concentration A-623 injection formulation from 34 liters of Amgen manufactured bulk drug substance, which was subsequently released for clinical use.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P136_S3	We believe we now have sufficient clinical material, both placebo and A-623, to dose up to 540 patients for a minimum of six months in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P137_S0	manufacturing of GMP bulk product for eventual pivotal clinical studies and an optional expansion and/or extension of the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P138_S0	The following chart outlines the basic manufacturing steps required for the production of A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	In July 2010, we received clearance from the FDA to begin recruitment of lupus patients into the PEARL-SC clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	The study protocol allows for enrollment of up to 600 patients treated for a maximum of 12 months.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S2	Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized into three active treatment arms and one placebo arm.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S3	Subsequent to this clearance, the FDA requested additional information regarding characterization and qualification of the manufactured vials of A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S4	In addition, the FDA requested minor changes to aspects of the PEARL-SC study including collection of ECG testing at the end of dosing and a recommendation for a corticosteroid tapering strategy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S5	Neither of these changes are considered material to the conduct of the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S6	The FDA also recommended we submit to the IND analytical and comparability data from our recently completed manufacturing lot of A-623 vials and a comparability proposal for purposes of soliciting their input prior to implementation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P139_S7	We submitted a response to the FDA in October 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P140_S0	It is our intent to discuss with the FDA comparability proposals which will propose the method by which future batches of material manufactured by our CMO would meet the FDA s standards for equivalence.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P140_S1	We also intend to continuously submit results of comparability testing from all of our manufacturing campaigns to the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P140_S2	If these batches meet specification and the FDA agrees A-623 product manufactured by our CMO meets comparability requirements, we believe these batches could be used to further extend and expand the PEARL-SC study and/or initiate identical Phase 3 clinical studies for purposes of registration.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	Prior to our in-licensing of A-623, Amgen completed two Phase 1 clinical studies of A-623 in lupus patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of the drug using intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P141_S1	Prior to conducting Phase 1 clinical studies in lupus patients, Amgen conducted a pre-Phase 1 clinical study in lupus patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P141_S2	In Amgen s pre-Phase 1 clinical study, individual B-cell subsets, such as mature na ve B-cells, activated B-cells and memory B-cells, all therapeutic targets for A-623, were quantified in order to characterize the specific B-cell subset abnormalities associated with lupus.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	The randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1a clinical study evaluated A-623 as a single intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 56 lupus patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P142_S1	Intravenous doses included 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P143_S1	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P143_S2	Results from this clinical study indicated the safety and tolerability of A-623 administered as single dose of intravenous or subcutaneous was comparable to placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P143_S3	Single doses of A-623 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P143_S4	There were comparable adverse events between the A-623 and placebo groups with no deaths reported.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P143_S5	In addition, no neutralization antibodies were seen across all doses.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	The most common adverse events were nausea (15%), headache (10%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%) and diarrhea (8%).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	A-623 was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study as an intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 63 lupus patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S1	The intravenous dose was 6 mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S2	Patients received their doses of A-623 or placebo once-weekly for four weeks.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S3	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple dose administrations of A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S4	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of A-623 after multiple doses.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S5	Results showed that multiple doses of A-623 exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S6	Further, results demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in total B-cells as early as 15 days of treatment, and total B-cell reduction (up to approximately 60-70% of baseline) reached its nadir after about 160 days of therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P145_S7	By six months after treatment, the B-cell populations had returned to baseline levels.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	An experimental analysis was also conducted to assess B-cell subsets in patients following multiple doses.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P146_S1	Results demonstrated that A-623 selectively modulates certain B-cell subsets and induced trends toward normalizing the B-cell abnormalities that were observed in lupus patients in the pre-Phase 1 clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	Results indicated that the tolerability of A-623 administered as multiple doses of intravenous or subcutaneous administration was generally comparable to placebo.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P147_S1	There were no deaths reported between the A-623 and placebo groups.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	Few neutralization antibodies were seen, and all resolved in subsequent visits.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P148_S1	Based on these results and published data from competitor studies, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating A-623 in lupus patients during the second half of 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	A-001 is an intravenously administered, potent, broad-spectrum inhibitor of sPLA 2 , including forms IIa, V and X. A-001 will be evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease in at-risk patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P149_S1	Substantial scientific evidence implicates sPLA 2 activity in the development of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as other forms of acute lung injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	The FDA granted orphan drug and fast-track designation for A-001 for the prevention of acute chest syndrome in at-risk patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P150_S1	We currently retain all worldwide product rights, except in Japan where Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P150_S2	We also licensed A-001 from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. in July 2006.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P151_S0	sPLA 2 levels increase in advance of acute chest syndrome episodes and can be used alongside the presence of fever to strongly predict an impending episode.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P151_S1	There is a strong correlation between levels of CRP and sPLA 2 in this patient population.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P151_S2	Patients with acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease can exhibit levels of sPLA 2 that can be 100 times greater than normal.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P151_S3	We believe that early intervention with A-001 to inhibit sPLA 2 activity may offer a novel preventative therapy to improve outcome among sickle cell disease patients presenting with a high risk of acute chest syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	Sickle cell disease is a lifelong genetic, blood disorder typically diagnosed during early childhood.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P152_S1	According to the Sickle Cell Information Center, in the United States, over 70,000 people currently suffer from the disease and approximately 1,000 children are born with the disease annually.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P152_S2	According to Medtech Insight, in Europe, there are over 200,000 people suffering from the disease, and the numbers increase dramatically in Africa, where, according to the WHO, 200,000 children alone are born with sickle cell disease each year.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P152_S3	Life expectancy for these patients is significantly shortened, with most expected to live only until their mid-40s.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	The disease is characterized by structurally altered red blood cells that assume an abnormal shape, similar to a sickle, and produce an altered form of hemoglobin.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P153_S1	These altered red blood cells have a shortened life-cycle, become stiff and have difficulty passing through the body s small blood vessels.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P153_S2	At times, these abnormal cells may obstruct or block blood flow through small blood vessels, leading to significant damage in tissue and bone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	During VOC, blockage occurs within the circulation of the long bones, causing microscopic bone damage.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P154_S1	Fragments of bone or bone fat may break free and embolize to the lungs, causing lung injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P155_S0	VOC is a common trigger for the more serious complication of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P156_S0	Acute chest syndrome exhibits symptoms and characteristics similar to acute lung injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P157_S0	There are an estimated 10,000 episodes of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease per year in the United States.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P157_S1	It represents the most common cause of death in sickle cell patients and the second most common cause of hospitalization among such patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P157_S2	A majority of sickle cell patients will experience at least one episode of acute chest syndrome and repeated episodes can result in progressive lung disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P158_S0	The disorder is most common in the two- to four- year age group and gradually declines in incidence with age.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P159_S0	There are no marketed therapies targeting acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P160_S0	The most common treatment regimen includes heavy doses of corticosteroids, opiates, transfusion and antibiotics while the patient suffers through the attack.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P160_S1	In addition, hydroxyurea, a chemotherapy, was found to reduce the frequency of VOC and the need for blood transfusions in adult patients with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P160_S2	However, all of these therapeutics are associated with significant adverse effects while only offering limited patient benefit.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P161_S0	Patients will be randomized to receive a continuous infusion of A-001 or placebo for 48 hours after randomization.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P161_S1	The primary endpoint of this study will be freedom from acute chest syndrome as determined by physician assessment and independent review of chest X-rays.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P161_S2	This study represents a unique treatment approach for a small, orphan designated indication.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P161_S3	As a result the appropriateness of the design and endpoints of this study for purposes of registration will only be known at the conclusion of the study and upon submission to the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P162_S0	Phase 2 Acute Chest Syndrome in Hospitalized Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Study Investigation of the Modulation of Phospholipase in Acute Chest Syndrome, or IMPACTS.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P163_S0	In January 2007, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of A-001 therapy when administered as a 48-hour continuous infusion.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P163_S1	The clinical study was designed to enroll up to 75 patients across approximately 30 sites in the United States.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P164_S0	fever and serum sPLA 2 concentration level greater than 50 mg/mL.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P165_S0	The primary endpoint for the clinical study was designed to assess safety and tolerability.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P165_S1	Secondary endpoints included the absence of acute chest syndrome, suppression of sPLA 2 , reduced need for blood transfusions and assessment of pharmacokinetics.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S0	The first group of patients was randomized 2:1 to receive low dose A-001 or placebo as a 48-hour continuous infusion.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S1	A pre-specified interim analysis was conducted in February 2009 after the 30th patient completed treatment to examine safety and adjust dosing schedules.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S2	The interim data was balanced between two dosing arms of 30 55 g/kg/hr (n = 11) and 55 g/kg/hr (n = 6).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S3	Interim results indicated serum levels of A-001 when dosed at 55 ig/kg/hr reduced sPLA 2 activity levels by more than 80% from baseline within 48 hours.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S4	Furthermore, the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease appeared to be related to the level of sPLA 2 activity.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S5	The DSMB recommended the clinical study continue based on safety and tolerability.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S6	In addition, given the safety profile, the DSMB approved the addition of a higher dose group of 110 g/kg/hr via continuous infusion during the second half of the clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P166_S7	We believe that the data suggests A-001 can suppress sPLA 2 at levels that may prevent the complication of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P167_S0	Reductions of sPLA 2 activity from baseline and incidence of acute chest syndrome (including placebo patients and patients receiving A-001).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P167_S1	Exploratory analysis to determine correlation between degree of sPLA 2 suppression and incidence of acute chest syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P168_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P168_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on:
1316175_11_ITEM1_P169_S0	Inflammatory processes and lipid abnormalities are central to the onset of acute coronary syndrome and the development of CAD.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P170_S0	Varespladib operates through a novel mechanism of action to offer both targeted anti-inflammatory activity and incremental lipid reductions, including LDL-C, when used in combination with statins.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P170_S1	Despite the benefits of statin therapy, many acute coronary syndrome patients still remain at substantial risk of a coronary event, suggesting additional biological mechanisms may be relevant, including inflammation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P170_S2	We believe that combination therapy with varespladib and statins will provide acute coronary syndrome patients with a unique, short-term therapeutic option unavailable with existing agents today.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P170_S3	In addition, we believe that an opportunity exists in the future to evaluate varespladib in chronic indications such as CAD.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P171_S0	We are advancing the development of A-623 to exploit the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P171_S1	We have initiated the Phase 2b clinical study known as PEARL-SC in lupus patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P171_S2	We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of this compound in lupus or in other B-cell mediated diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or Sj gren s Syndrome, that may benefit from BAFF antagonism, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P172_S0	In the future, if additional funds are available, we may develop A-001, an intravenous sPLA 2 inhibitor for prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, because we identified that elevations in sPLA 2 activity are known to precede and predict disease progression.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P172_S1	Given that there are currently no approved drugs for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, we have received orphan drug designation and fast track status from the FDA for A-001.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P173_S0	Leveraging Our sPLA 2 Expertise to Develop Products for Additional Disease Indications.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P174_S0	We believe that we have developed a leadership position in the field of sPLA 2 inhibition.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P174_S1	Beyond our acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome program, we believe that sPLA 2 inhibition may have applications in other acute disease settings where early intervention may have an impact and reduce anti-inflammatory activity, such as acute lung injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P174_S2	Additionally, we believe that we can apply our sPLA 2 expertise to develop novel therapeutics for a number of chronic diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P174_S3	For example, sPLA 2 has been shown to be involved in the development of such chronic inflammatory diseases as atherosclerosis and dermatitis.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P174_S4	We plan to pursue these indications opportunistically and potentially in collaboration with third parties.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P175_S0	We are also developing new and unique sPLA 2 inhibitor compounds for additional therapeutic areas.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P175_S1	A-003 is our second generation lead candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P175_S2	We plan to continue preclinical development of A-003 for an IND filing and we will continue to assess additional new compounds.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P176_S0	Developing Commercial Strategies Designed to Maximize Our Product Candidates Market Potential.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P177_S0	Our primary product candidates are focused on either the acute care setting in the hospital or highly-specialized physician segments, such as rheumatologists.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P177_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications such as acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P177_S2	In other chronic indications such as CAD, we intend to seek commercial collaborations with companies that have a large, dedicated sales force focused on general practitioners and cardiologists and we plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P178_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P178_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P178_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P179_S0	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P179_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P179_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P179_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P179_S4	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P180_S0	The sPLA 2 product candidates we are currently developing, if approved, will face intense competition, either as monotherapies or in combination therapies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P180_S1	Although there are no sPLA 2 inhibitors currently approved by the FDA, we are aware of other pharmaceutical companies, as described below that are developing product candidates in this area for separate indications.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P181_S0	Our lead product candidate, varespladib, for the short-term (16-week) treatment of acute coronary syndrome has a dual mechanism of action that we believe confers anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering and lipid-modulating benefits.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P182_S0	The market for cardiovascular therapeutics and acute coronary syndrome, specifically, is especially large and competitive.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P183_S0	A wide range of medications are typically administered to patients suffering an acute coronary syndrome event in order to reduce ischemia and thrombosis and improve blood flow.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P183_S1	We expect that varespladib for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome patients, if approved, may compete with the following anti-inflammatory therapeutics in development.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P184_S0	Collaboration with Human Genome Sciences, Inc.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P185_S0	Additionally, we are aware of other products in development that are being tested for anti-inflammatory benefits in patients with acute coronary syndrome such as Via Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its 5-lipoxygenase, or 5-LO, inhibitor, which has been evaluated in Phase 2 clinical studies, GlaxoSmithKline plc and its product candidate, darapladib, which is an Lp-PLA 2 inhibitor currently being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P185_S1	If approved, these products or others in development may compete directly with varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P186_S0	Statins Treatment with varespladib is designed to offer anti-inflammatory benefits for acute coronary syndrome patients that are additive to treatment with statins.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P186_S1	However, statin therapy is thought to confer some element of anti-inflammatory benefit as monotherapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P186_S2	In certain circumstances, it is possible the anti-inflammatory benefits of statin monotherapy with products such as Lipitor (atorvastatin), which is marketed by Pfizer Inc., Crestor (rosuvastatin), which is marketed by AstraZeneca UK Limited and Zocor (simvastatin), which is marketed by Merck Co., Inc. may be viewed as competitive to that offered by varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P187_S0	Other Lipid-Lowering Therapies Increasingly, additional lipid-lowering agents are being administered either in combination with statins or as monotherapy to help acute coronary syndrome patients reduce levels of LDL-C. Varespladib has demonstrated LDL-C lowering benefits when tested as monotherapy and in combination with statin therapy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P187_S1	To the extent acute coronary syndrome patients need additional LDL-C lowering, varespladib may compete for use with other approved agents such as Vytorin, which is a fixed dose combination therapy combining ezetimibe and Zocor, Tricor (fenofibrate tablets) and Niaspan (niacin), both of which are marketed by Abbott Laboratories, Zetia (ezetimibe) and fish oils (omega-3).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P188_S0	Benlysta is currently under review with the FDA and, if approved, would be the first novel therapy in the last fifty years.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P189_S0	Current therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants generally act to hold back broadly the proliferation of many types of cells, including white blood cells.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P189_S1	However, use of these agents is associated with significant adverse events and broad immune suppression.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P190_S0	Several new biological agents under development have targeted BAFF (or BLyS) and other B-cell related pathways for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P190_S1	These product candidates include Benlysta (belimumab) from Human Genome Sciences, Inc., LY2127399 from Eli Lilly and Company, atacicept, or TACI-Ig, from ZymoGenetics Inc. and epratuzumab from Immunomedics, Inc., as well as others acting via non B-cell mechanisms, such as Lupuzor from Cephalon.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P190_S2	We believe that A-623 may offer potential differentiation from these agents, including demonstrated dosing flexibility with both subcutaneous and intravenous delivery; selective modulation and reduction of relevant B-cell types in lupus patients; the ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF; its smaller size as compared to a full antibody, which may confer differentiating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics; and distinct patent protection based on a novel and proprietary technology developed and commercialized by Amgen, which may also confer potential manufacturing advantages with lower cost of goods based on a bacterial fermentation manufacturing process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P191_S0	There are no currently approved agents for treatment or prophylaxis of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P191_S1	Droxia (hydroxyurea) is approved for prevention of VOC in sickle cell disease and thus could reduce the pool of patients with VOC at risk for acute chest syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P191_S2	In addition, there is evidence in the literature that blood transfusions may prevent the occurrence of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, and a randomized clinical study is underway by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to explore this possibility.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P192_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P192_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P193_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_11_ITEM1_P194_S0	operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

1316175_11_ITEM1_P218_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P218_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P218_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P218_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P219_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P219_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P220_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P220_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P220_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P221_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of varespladib, A-623, A-001, A-003 or one or more new sPLA 2 compounds, one or more of the U.S. patents listed above may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.

1316175_11_ITEM1_P226_S0	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P227_S0	In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd., pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license in all countries except for Japan to certain technology and compounds relating to sPLA 2 inhibitors.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P227_S1	The licensed technology was largely developed under a research and development agreement between Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd., which was entered into between the parties in August 1992 and terminated in December 2004.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P228_S0	Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive rights to (i) use licensed patent rights and know-how to identify and develop sPLA 2 inhibitors, (ii) develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell licensed compounds and pharmaceutical formulations thereof, including varespladib, A-001, A-003 and other sPLA 2 inhibitors and (iii) grant sublicenses.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P228_S1	The licensed patent rights include a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P228_S2	Certain patents and applications within the licensed patent rights are defined as core patents.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P228_S3	Although the agreement does not allow us to sell or offer for sale licensed products in Japan, it does allow us to conduct preclinical and clinical studies in Japan in support of applications for marketing authorization outside of Japan, and to make and have made licensed products in Japan for use or sale outside of Japan.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P228_S4	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. retain the right to use licensed products for research purposes only.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P228_S5	Eli Lilly also retains the right to conduct studies of specific compounds in animals for research purposes, but only with our prior written approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P228_S6	In addition, Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains the non-exclusive right to make and have made licensed products for supply to us, as well as its rights to continue research, development and marketing of licensed technology in Japan.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P229_S0	Upon entering into the license agreement, we assumed control of all prosecution and maintenance of core patents prosecuted and maintained by Eli Lilly prior to the agreement.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P230_S0	by Shionogi Co., Ltd. prior to the agreement remained under the control of Shionogi Co., Ltd. Licensed patent rights that were not classified as core remained under the control of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P230_S1	However, control of certain of these patents and applications has since been transferred to us following the decision by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd. to discontinue prosecution and maintenance.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S0	Upon entering into the license agreement, we made one-time payments of cash in the amount of $250,000 and issued shares of convertible preferred stock with a total aggregate value of $2.3 million to Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S1	We are required to make various milestone payments and to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage as net sales increase.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S2	Both the milestone and royalty payment schedules vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., oral versus intravenously administered).
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S3	For varespladib, we are required to pay up to $32.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S4	For A-001, we are required to pay up to $3.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $25.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S5	For other product formulations that we are not currently developing, we would be required to pay up to $2.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $35.5 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S6	Our royalty payments vary based upon type of formulation and annual net sales, but generally range from the mid-single digits to the low double digits.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P231_S7	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular licensed product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the first date on which a generic version of the licensed product reaches a 25% total market share in that country.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P232_S0	The license agreement will remain in effect for the length of our royalty obligation on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate earlier or until termination by mutual agreement.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P232_S1	Upon expiration of the agreement, our license will remain in effect and will convert to an irrevocable, perpetual royalty-free license.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P232_S2	If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement, Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd. can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P233_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to A-623, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P234_S0	Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing A-623, as well as the right to grant sublicenses.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P234_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P234_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed A-623 patents and applications.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P234_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P235_S0	During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P235_S1	Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than A-623 that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P236_S0	We paid a first installment fee of $3.0 million and a second installment fee of $3.0 million.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P236_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any A-623 formulation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P236_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post- approval milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P236_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P237_S0	and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P238_S0	The license agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P238_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P239_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under cGMP with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P239_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P239_S2	Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P240_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P240_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P240_S2	In order to commercialize any of our product candidates, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P240_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, acute care and orphan indications such as acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, we may seek to commercialize these product candidates alone.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P240_S4	In therapeutic areas that require a large sales force selling to a large and diverse prescribing population, such as chronic indications such as CAD, we currently plan to partner with third parties to commercialize our product candidates while retaining rights to co-promote our products to a select audience of high prescribing physicians in the United States, thereby supplementing or enhancing the efforts of a commercial partner.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P240_S5	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P241_S0	In North America and Western Europe, patients in the target markets for our product candidates are largely managed by medical specialists in the areas of cardiology and internal medicine.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P242_S0	Historically, companies have experienced substantial commercial success through the deployment of specialized sales forces that can address a majority of key prescribers, particularly within the cardiovascular disease marketplace.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P242_S1	Therefore, we expect to utilize a specialized sales force in North America for the sales and marketing of product candidates that we may successfully develop.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P242_S2	Based upon sales models, we estimate that we could effectively promote (supplementing a commercial partner s sales efforts) the treatment of acute coronary syndrome to 3,000 cardiologists with approximately 300 sales representatives in North America and Western Europe.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P242_S3	If we obtain additional label indications for varespladib or A-001, we may choose to increase our sales force size to promote these new uses.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P243_S0	Due to their concentrated and focused nature, specialty target audiences may be reached with more focused and cost-effective marketing campaigns.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P244_S0	Outside of North America, and in situations or markets where a more favorable return may be realized through licensing commercial rights to a third party, we may license a portion or all of our commercial rights in a territory to a third party in exchange for one or more of the following: up-front payments, research funding, development funding, milestone payments and royalties on drug sales.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P245_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring varespladib, A-623 and A-001 to market alone or in collaboration with a co-development or co-promotion partner.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P245_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P245_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P246_S0	such as those we are developing.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P246_S1	Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process, and our biological product candidate, A-623, must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P247_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P247_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P247_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P247_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P248_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_11_ITEM1_P249_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P250_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P251_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P251_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P251_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P251_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P252_S0	Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P252_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P252_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P252_S3	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P253_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P253_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P253_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P253_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P253_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P254_S0	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P254_S1	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P255_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_11_ITEM1_P256_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P256_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P257_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P258_S0	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P258_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P259_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P259_S1	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P259_S2	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P259_S3	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P260_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P260_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P260_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P261_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P261_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P262_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P262_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P262_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P263_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P263_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P263_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P263_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P264_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P264_S1	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P264_S2	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P265_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P266_S0	processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P267_S0	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P267_S1	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P267_S2	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P268_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P268_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P268_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P268_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P268_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P268_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P268_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P269_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P269_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P269_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P270_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P270_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P270_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P270_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P270_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P270_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P270_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P271_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P272_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P272_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P272_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P272_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P272_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P272_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P273_S0	will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P273_S1	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P274_S0	HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P274_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P274_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P275_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P275_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P275_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P275_S3	The current pediatric exclusivity provision was reauthorized in September 2007.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P276_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P276_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P276_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P276_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P277_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P277_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P277_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P277_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P278_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P278_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P279_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P279_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P280_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P280_S1	Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P281_S0	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P281_S1	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P282_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P283_S0	significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P283_S1	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P283_S2	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P284_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P284_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P284_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P285_S0	We have been granted fast track designation for our product candidate, A-001, for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease in at-risk patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P285_S1	Even though we have received fast track designation for A-001, the FDA may later decide that A-001 no longer meets the conditions for qualification.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P285_S2	In addition, obtaining fast track designation may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P286_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P287_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P287_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P287_S2	Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P287_S3	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P288_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P288_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P288_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P289_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P289_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P290_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P290_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P291_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P291_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P291_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P292_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P292_S1	For example, in September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the authority to require post-market studies and clinical studies, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, approved by the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P292_S2	In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug or biological product, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the product, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events for varespladib and whether the product is a new molecular entity.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P293_S0	We have submitted a REMS as an appendix to the SPA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P293_S1	If the FDA determines our REMS is necessary, we must submit a REMS plan as part of an NDA or BLA.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P293_S2	The FDA may require that a REMS include various elements, such as a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the product, or other measures.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P294_S0	Failure to comply with any requirements under the new law may result in significant penalties.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P294_S1	The new law also authorizes significant civil money penalties for the dissemination of false or misleading direct-to-consumer advertisements and allows the FDA to require companies to submit direct-to-consumer television drug advertisements for FDA review prior to public dissemination.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P294_S2	Additionally, the new law expands the clinical study registry so that sponsors of all clinical studies, except for Phase 1 clinical studies, are required to submit certain clinical study information for inclusion in the clinical study registry data bank.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P295_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P295_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P296_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P296_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P296_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P296_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P297_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P297_S1	European Union member states require both regulatory clearance by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P298_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P298_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P298_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P299_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P299_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P299_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P299_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P299_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S3	However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S6	Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S7	It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P300_S8	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P301_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P301_S1	For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P301_S2	Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P301_S3	Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P301_S4	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P301_S5	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P301_S6	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P302_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P302_S1	Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P302_S2	Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P302_S3	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P302_S4	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P302_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P302_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P303_S0	It is not clear what effect the MMA will have on the prices paid for currently approved drugs and the pricing options for new drugs approved after January 1, 2006.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P304_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P304_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P304_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P304_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P305_S0	There are also laws that govern a company s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P305_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company s ability to operate its business.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P306_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P307_S0	healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P307_S1	Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P307_S2	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P307_S3	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P307_S4	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P308_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P309_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P310_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P311_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P311_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P311_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P311_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P311_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P311_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P312_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had 25 employees, eight of whom hold an M.D., Ph.D. or Pharm.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P312_S1	D. All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P312_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P313_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P313_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC, which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P313_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P314_S0	The mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_11_ITEM1_P315_S0	Through a link on the Investors section of our website (under SEC Filings in the Financial Information section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this report.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We are a development stage company with only six years of operating history.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have focused primarily on developing our three product candidates, varespladib, A-623 and varespladib sodium (A-001).
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We have financed our operations exclusively through equity offerings and private placements of convertible debt and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in September 2004.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our net losses were approximately $8.7 million in 2006, $25.7 million in 2007, $18.1 million in 2008, $12.2 million in 2009 and $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	As of December 31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $105.6 million.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Substantially all of our losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect to incur additional losses over the next several years, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate revenues.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect our development expenses, as well as our clinical product manufacturing expenses, to increase in connection with our pivotal Phase 3 clinical study named VISTA-16 for varespladib, our Phase 2b clinical study named PEARL-SC for A-623 and other clinical studies related to the development of A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, we will incur additional costs of operating as a public company and, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We have never generated any revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct preclinical tests in animals and clinical studies in human beings, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We have not generated any revenue from our development-stage product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	All of our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	These product candidates could fail in clinical studies if we are unable to demonstrate that they are effective or if they cause unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Failure of our product candidates in clinical studies would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Additionally, all of our other product candidates are in preclinical development.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our drug discovery efforts may not produce any other viable or marketable product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We do not expect any of our potential product candidates to be commercially available until at least 2013.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Even if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, the approved product candidate may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Physicians, patients, payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend any of our products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Even if we are able to generate product sales, which we cannot guarantee, we may not achieve profitability soon thereafter, if ever.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are unable to generate product revenues, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without additional funding.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our future capital requirements could be substantial and will depend on many factors including:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	revenues received from approved products, if any, in the future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of the date of this report, we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	terminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for sale.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to each of Eli Lilly and Company, Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Amgen Inc. is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, and Shionogi Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialize certain secretory phospholipase A 2 , or sPLA 2 , inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and other diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Pursuant to our license agreement with them, we have an obligation to pay to each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. significant milestone and royalty payments based upon how we develop and commercialize certain sPLA 2 inhibitors, including varespladib and A-001, and our achievement of certain significant corporate, clinical and financial events.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	For varespladib, we are required to pay up to $32.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	For A-001, we are required to pay up to $3.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $25.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	For other product formulations that we are not currently developing, we would be required to pay up to $2.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $35.5 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In addition, in December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Pursuant to our license agreement with Amgen, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any A-623 formulation.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S9	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to Eli Lilly, Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Amgen is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of certain sPLA 2 inhibitors or A-623, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P17_S10	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, conducting product development activities for our primary product candidates, varespladib, A-623 and A-001, and performing research and development.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our three primary product candidates, varespladib, A-623 and A-001, which are still under clinical development.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot assure you that these product candidates or any of our other product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our three primary product candidates successfully.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our lead product candidate is varespladib, which has completed its Phase 2 clinical studies and for which we have received (i) an agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for the VISTA-16 Phase 3 study protocol, and (ii) scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency on our European development strategy for varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We initiated the VISTA-16 study for varespladib in June 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our next product candidate is A-623, which has completed several Phase 1 clinical studies and recently began enrollment for our Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In July 2010, we received clearance from the FDA to begin recruitment of lupus patients into the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In November 2010, we placed a voluntary hold on the PEARL-SC study due to problems found with vials.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Patient enrollment in the study was temporarily suspended and dosing was discontinued in patients who were enrolled in the study while we conducted an analysis of the problem.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We resolved the issues found with the vials in December 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	After analysis, simulation and consultation with industry experts, we determined that shipping on dry ice was the root cause of the issue.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Shipping logistics were modified and we reinitiated enrollment in PEARL-SC and dosing in January 2011.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We have received no reports of patient-related side effects or problems with drug administration that could be attributed to the vial problem.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our third product candidate, varespladib sodium (A-001), is an intravenously administered inhibitor of sPLA 2 .
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have completed a Phase 2 clinical study for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	A pre-specified interim review of our Phase 2 clinical study results by a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, indicated A-001, at a certain dose, reduced sPLA 2 activity by more than 80% from baseline within 48 hours.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Furthermore, the incidence of acute chest syndrome appeared to be related to the level of sPLA 2 activity.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are not permitted to market our varespladib and A-001 product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a new drug application, or NDA, or with respect to our A-623 product candidate, approval of a biologics license application, or BLA, from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We have not submitted an NDA or BLA or received marketing approval for any of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P29_S4	The FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For example, the independent statistician that is conducting the data review may recommend that we stop our VISTA-16 study for varespladib if certain biomarkers of inflammation and lipid profiles fail to meet pre-specified reductions from a subset of the first 1,000 or more patients.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Product development costs to us and our collaborators will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidates or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	For example, we may need to increase our sample size for our VISTA-16 study for varespladib if the overall major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE, rate is lower than expected.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delaying factors outside our control.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The results of biomarker assays in earlier clinical studies in varespladib are not necessarily predictive of future results, and therefore the results of biomarker assays in the VISTA-16 study may not be similar to those observed previously.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Success in our Phase 2 clinical studies in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, C-reactive protein, or CRP, sPLA 2 and interleukin-6, or IL-6, during treatment with varespladib does not ensure that later clinical studies, such as our VISTA-16 study, will demonstrate similar reductions in these biomarkers.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Each of these biomarkers has been associated with an increased risk for secondary MACE following an acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our inability to demonstrate similar biomarker effects in our VISTA-16 study may reduce our ability to achieve our primary endpoint to reduce MACE and to achieve regulatory approval of varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Even if we demonstrate similar biomarker effects in our VISTA-16 study, those results do not necessarily equate with reductions in MACE.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, varespladib, A-623, A-001 or any other product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidates, including varespladib, A-623 and A-001, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidates have performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we breach the license agreements for our primary product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our primary product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are party to an agreement with Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. containing exclusive, worldwide licenses, except for Japan, of the composition of matter, methods of making and methods of use for certain sPLA 2 inhibitors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We are also party to an agreement with Amgen containing exclusive, worldwide licenses of the composition of matter and methods of use for A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These agreements require us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify Eli Lilly, Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Amgen under the terms of the agreements.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors may terminate our exclusive licenses and may be able to re-obtain licensed technology and aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us that relate to the licensed technology that originated from the licensors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of varespladib, A-623 and A-001 after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreements.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the licenses could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for varespladib, A-623 or A-001.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The market for inflammatory disease therapeutics is especially large and competitive.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We are aware of other companies with products in development that are being tested for anti-inflammatory benefits in patients with acute coronary syndrome, such as Via Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its 5-lipoxygenase, or 5-LO, inhibitor, which has been evaluated in Phase 2 clinical studies; and GlaxoSmithKline plc and its product candidate, darapladib, which is a lipoprotein associated phospholipase A 2 , or Lp-PLA 2 , inhibitor currently being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Although there are no sPLA 2 inhibitor compounds currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, Droxia, or hydroxyurea, is approved for the prevention of vaso-occlusive crisis, or VOC, in sickle cell disease and thus could reduce the pool of patients with VOC at risk for acute chest syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Further, we are aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of lupus, including Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline plc, who have a BAFF antagonist monoclonal antibody product candidate, Benlysta, which recently reported favorable results from two Phase 3 clinical studies in lupus; ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Merck Serono S.A., whose dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist fusion protein, Atacicept, is in a Phase 3 clinical study for lupus; and Immunomedics, Inc. and UCB S.A., who recently reported favorable results for their CD-22 antagonist humanized antibody, epratuzumab, which completed a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus and has begun a Phase 3 study.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P51_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Phase 2 clinical studies conducted by us with our product candidates have generated differences in adverse effects and serious adverse events.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	The most common adverse effects seen with any of our product candidates versus placebo include diarrhea, headache, nausea and increases in alanine aminotransferase, which is an enzyme that indicates liver cell injury.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	The most common serious adverse events seen with any of our product candidates include death, VOC and congestive heart failure.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P53_S4	While none of these serious adverse events were considered related to the administration of our product candidates by the clinical investigators, if serious adverse events that are considered related to our product candidates are observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Further, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from these product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize any of our product candidates until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate we develop.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and FDA regulatory review.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our agreement with the FDA on an SPA for our VISTA-16 study of varespladib for the potential treatment of acute coronary syndrome does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review of the study or the product candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The FDA s SPA process creates a written agreement between the sponsoring company and the FDA regarding clinical study design and other clinical study issues that can be used to support approval of a product candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The SPA is intended to provide assurance that if the agreed upon clinical study protocols are followed and the clinical study endpoints are achieved, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	However, the SPA agreement is not a guarantee of an approval of a product or any permissible claims about the product.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	In particular, the SPA is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement is entered into become evident, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise or if the sponsor company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical study protocols.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Although we have an agreement with the FDA on an SPA for our VISTA-16 clinical study of varespladib for the potential short-term (16-week) treatment of acute coronary syndrome, we do not know how the FDA will interpret the commitments under our agreed upon SPA, how it will interpret the data and results or whether it will approve our varespladib product candidate for the short-term (16-week) treatment of acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Regardless of our SPA agreement, we cannot guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review of our VISTA-16 study.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	For example, the label ultimately approved for varespladib, if any, may include restrictions on use.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Further, the FDA has indicated that long-term safety data on varespladib may need to be obtained as a post-market requirement.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P61_S4	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P61_S5	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P61_S6	If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	New legal and regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain approvals for our product candidates and could limit or make more burdensome our ability to commercialize any approved products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	New federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	For example, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, granted the FDA new authority to impose post-approval clinical study requirements, require safety-related changes to product labeling and require the adoption of risk management plans, referred to in the legislation as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The REMS may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals, and restrictions on distribution and use.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Pursuant to the FDAAA, if the FDA makes the requisite findings, it might require that a new product be used only by physicians with specified specialized training, only in specified designated health care settings, or only in conjunction with special patient testing and monitoring.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P65_S4	The legislation also included the following: requirements for providing the public information on ongoing clinical studies through a clinical study registry and for disclosing clinical study results to the public through such registry; renewed requirements for conducting clinical studies to generate information on the use of products in pediatric patients; and substantial new penalties, for example, for false or misleading consumer advertisements.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Other proposals have been made to impose additional requirements on drug approvals, further expand post-approval requirements, and restrict sales and promotional activities.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P65_S6	The new legislation, and the additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidates, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	If any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval does not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Paul F. Truex, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Colin Hislop, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer and the other principal members of our executive team listed under Executive Officers in Part III of this report.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P71_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Also in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P77_S3	As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P77_S4	These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third-party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, the Health Care Reform Law, and additional prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P79_S4	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the European Union and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P83_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P85_S2	If and when we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P88_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P90_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P92_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P92_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P92_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P92_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P94_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P94_S2	If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates or market them.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P95_S1	In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P95_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	As part of our discussions to reactivate our US IND for A-623, we received a request from the FDA for additional information regarding the characterization and qualification of the already manufactured vials of A-623 and plans for any future manufactured vials of A-623 that we intend to use in clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In response to this request, we provided the FDA additional analytical data regarding all lots of previously manufactured A-623 to be utilized in the current PEARL-SC clinical study.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	submit a comparability protocol to the FDA to establish appropriate comparability and specifications requirements of newly manufactured vials of A-623 to be included in any future clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	We anticipate submitting this protocol to the FDA in Q2 2011.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Should the FDA not agree with our comparability protocol proposal or if we are unable to agree on the specifications for future A-623 manufacturing, further clinical development of A-623 beyond the PEARL-SC clinical study would be substantially delayed and we would incur substantial additional expense.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P98_S1	There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P98_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P98_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P98_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P99_S1	If we successfully commercialize any of our drugs, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P99_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P99_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, the satisfaction of which on a timely basis may not be met.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P101_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P101_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P101_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P101_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P103_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P103_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P103_S3	For example, organizations like the American Heart Association have made recommendations about therapies in the cardiovascular therapeutics market.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P103_S4	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	If our or our licensors patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidates or any future products, others could compete with us more directly, which would harm our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	As of the date of this report and as described in the section entitled Business Intellectual Property on page 25, we hold a total of four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two pending U.S. provisional patent applications and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Another PCT application has entered the national phase in the European Patent Office, the Eurasian Patent Organization and 17 other countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P105_S2	We have also entered into exclusive license agreements for certain composition of matter, method of use and method of making patents and patent applications for certain of our development compounds.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P105_S3	These license agreements encompass (i) 13 U.S. patents, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, five European, or EP, patents, one pending EP patent application, 20 non-EP foreign patents and three pending non-EP foreign patent applications relating to varespladib and A-001; (ii) more than 30 U.S. patents, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, six EP patents, one pending EP patent application, 13 issued non-EP foreign patents and one pending non-EP foreign patent applications relating to other sPLA 2 inhibiting compounds including A-003; and (iii) two U.S. patents, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, two pending EP patent applications, eleven non-EP foreign patents and 13 non-EP foreign patent applications relating to A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P106_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P109_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P111_S0	the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P113_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P113_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P114_S0	not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P114_S1	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P115_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We have obtained exclusive, worldwide licenses, except for Japan, of the composition of matter, methods of making and methods of use for certain sPLA 2 compounds from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P116_S1	In addition, we are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize A-623, a novel BAFF inhibitor, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P116_S2	We may enter into additional licenses to third-party intellectual property in the future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering our in-licensed sPLA 2 compounds and A-623, respectively.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P117_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P117_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P117_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P117_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P117_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P118_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P118_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P118_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P119_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and to obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P120_S0	The United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in the regulatory approval process.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Assuming we gain a five-year patent term extension for each of our current product candidates in clinical development, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to these product candidates, we would have exclusive rights to varespladib s U.S. new chemical entity patent (the primary patent covering the compound as a new composition of matter) until 2019 and to A-623 s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2027.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P121_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P121_S1	Assuming we gain such a five-year extension for each of our current product candidates in clinical development, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to these product candidates, we would have exclusive rights to varespladib s European new chemical entity patents until 2020 and to A-623 s European new chemical entity patents until 2027.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Entity, or NCE, exclusivity from the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S1	NCE exclusivity would prevent the FDA from approving any generic competitor following NDA approval independent of the patent status of varespladib.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S2	Further, since A-623 has not been previously approved, A-623 could be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity from the FDA.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S3	During the data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S4	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small molecule compound or biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that compound or biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S5	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S6	However, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P122_S7	If we fail to receive such Hatch-Waxman extensions or marketing exclusivity rights or if we receive extensions that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P123_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P124_S0	We typically develop our product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P124_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of these product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P124_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P125_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell any of our product candidates or proposed product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P125_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P126_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P126_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P126_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P127_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P129_S1	If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidates and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P131_S0	property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P131_S1	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P131_S2	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors existing or future patents.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P133_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P134_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P134_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P136_S0	The market price for our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P136_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P137_S0	discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P138_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P138_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P138_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P138_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P138_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P139_S0	trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P140_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P140_S1	We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P140_S2	Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention from our business.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Because a small number of our existing stockholders own a majority of our voting stock, your ability to influence corporate matters will be limited.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P142_S1	As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P142_S2	These persons will also have the ability to control our management and business affairs.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P142_S3	This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P144_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there were 32,880,353 shares of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P144_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock units of 1,578,491 that, if exercised or released, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P144_S2	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P144_S3	Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P144_S4	Moreover, certain holders of shares of common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P145_S0	We have registered all common stock that we may issue under our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan ) and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P145_S1	As of February 28, 2011, an aggregate of 1,778,261 shares of our common stock has been reserved for future issuance under the 2010 Plan, plus any shares reserved and unissued under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, and an aggregate of 350,000 shares has been reserved for future issuance under our ESPP.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P145_S2	These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lock-up agreements referred to above.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P145_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P146_S0	We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P147_S0	We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P147_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P148_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P148_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P150_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P150_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P150_S2	For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P150_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P151_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P151_S1	Commencing in 2011, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P151_S2	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P151_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P152_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P153_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P153_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P153_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P156_S0	the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P157_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P157_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P157_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P159_S1	An ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P159_S2	We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has occurred after each of our previous private placements of preferred stock and convertible debt, or our previous issuances of common stock, which if sufficient, taking into account prior or future shifts in our ownership over a three-year period, could cause us to undergo an ownership change.
1316175_11_ITEM1A_P159_S3	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	We are currently subleasing approximately 7,800 square feet of office space in Hayward, California, which we occupy under a sublease that commenced on October 1, 2008 and expired on January 31, 2011.
1316175_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	In January 2011, we renewed our sublease through July 31, 2011.
1316175_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We believe there is no litigation pending that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol ANTH since our IPO.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that offering, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Market:
1316175_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of 32,880,353 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by approximately 850 holders of record and beneficial holders, based on information provided by the Company s transfer agent.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Nasdaq Biotech Index from March 1, 2010 (the date of our IPO) through December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on March 1, 2010 in each of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Biotech Index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	The past performance of our common stock is no indication of future performance.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P4_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P4_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III of this report.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	All information under this Item has been previously reported on our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) on September 22, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	We did not repurchase any securities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We currently have one Phase 3 clinical program, varespladib, and two Phase 2 clinical programs, A-623 and A-001.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Two of our product candidates, varespladib and A-001, are designed to inhibit a novel enzyme target known as secretory phospholipase A 2 , or sPLA 2 .
1316175_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Elevated levels of sPLA 2 have been implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as in chronic diseases, including stable coronary artery disease.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	In addition, our Phase 2 product candidate, A-623, targets elevated levels of B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, lupus nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sj gren s Syndrome, Graves Disease and others.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We were incorporated and commenced operations in September 2004.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Since our inception, we have generated significant losses.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $105.6 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	As of the date of this filing, we have never generated any revenue and have generated only interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	We expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	To date, we have funded our operations through equity offerings and private placements of convertible debt, raising an aggregate of approximately $145.7 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition to the normal risks associated with development-stage companies, we may never successfully complete development of any of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We do not expect to generate revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates or in- license additional products that generate revenue.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	We intend to seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales, up-front fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships and royalties resulting from the licensing of the commercial rights to our intellectual property.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the nature, timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized, as well as any revenue we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidate development programs.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: licensing, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for our Phase 3 clinical study named VISTA- 16 for varespladib and for our Phase 2b clinical study named PEARL-SC for A-623, as well as for the development of our other product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	We are developing our product candidates in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project, but rather are allocated across our clinical stage programs.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2010:
1316175_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Includes Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project Credit under Section 48D of approximately $244,000.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	See Note 2 of our financial statements for more information.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Includes milestone payments of $3.5 million pursuant to amendments to the license agreements with each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co. Ltd., which were paid in the form of shares of common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Includes Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project Credit under Section 48D of approximately $488,000.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	See Note 2 of our financial statements for more information.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Includes license fees of $4.0 million pursuant to a license agreement with each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co. Ltd., which were paid in cash and shares of preferred stock in 2006.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Includes a one-time license initiation fee of $6.0 million pursuant to a license agreement with Amgen.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We began enrollment of patients in the VISTA-16 study of varespladib for the treatment of patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome in June 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	We also initiated the PEARL-SC study of A-623 in July 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	We intend to fund our clinical studies with existing cash and proceeds from potential future debt and equity offerings.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	As we obtain results from clinical studies, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Completion of clinical studies may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including:
1316175_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones such as number of patients enrolled.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P24_S5	If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	None of our product candidates has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions, including clinical, chemical manufacturing, regulatory, finance and business development.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , using the modified prospective method.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Compensation costs related to all equity instruments granted after January 1, 2006 are recognized at the grant-date fair value of the awards.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Additionally, we are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We account for stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions significantly impact stock-based compensation expense.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	As of December 31, 2010, 1,578,491 shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of stock options and release of restricted stock units.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to periodic impairment review.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	For publicly traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including factors such as current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security s issuer, the length of time an investment s fair value has been below our carrying value, and our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	If an investment s decline in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market prices, liquidation values or other metrics.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
1316175_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and readily accessible by us at the reporting date.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs are cost method investments, auction rate securities (ARS) and the Primary Fund.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	We measure our available-for-sale securities at fair value on a recurring basis.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Available-for-sale securities include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, money market funds and certificates of deposit.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Where possible, we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such items are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	When quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable, varying valuation techniques are used.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Such assets are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the hierarchy.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	We classify items in Level 2 if investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	We classify items in Level 3 if investments are valued using a pricing model, based on unobservable inputs in the market or that require us to develop our own assumptions.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	We are also exposed to market risk relating to our available-for-sale investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	These securities/issuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P48_S4	We monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other-than-temporary impairment charges.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We actively review current investment ratings, company specific events, and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	As of December 31, 2010 our short-term in marketable securities have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term investments as these investments generally consist of marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Recognized gains and losses on available for sale investments during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not material.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) consists of other comprehensive income and net loss.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Other comprehensive income includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income (loss).
1316175_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Specifically, the Company includes unrealized gains (losses) on available for sale securities in other comprehensive income (loss).
1316175_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Comprehensive income (loss) for each period presented is set forth in the Statement of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) and Comprehensive Loss.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs for employees in clinical, chemical manufacturing and regulatory functions, clinical studies performed by CROs, pharmaceutical development costs including product formulation and manufacturing, preclinical costs, license fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Change in research and development expenses from the years ended December 31, 2009 to 2010 (in millions):
1316175_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The increase in research and development expenses from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $3.5 million non-cash charge related to milestone payments recorded in connection with the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib, which was paid through the issuance of 531,914 shares of common stock; and increased CRO and manufacturing cost related to the launch of our Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib and Phase 2 clinical study of A-623, as well as increased headcount to support these clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for employees in executive, business development and operational functions, professional service fees including corporate legal fees, accountant fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Change in general and administrative expenses from the years ended December 31, 2009 to 2010 (in millions):
1316175_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to increased headcount and professional services incurred in connection with our financial audit and other costs associated with operating as a public company.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Other expense and interest income, net.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	Other expense consists of primarily non-cash charge related to the amortization of discounts, mark-to-market adjustment relating to warrants and embedded derivative associated with our convertible promissory notes issued in July and September of 2009, which were converted into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO in March 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Change in other expense and interest income, net, from the years ended December 31, 2009 to 2010 (in millions):
1316175_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The increase in other expense and interest income, net, from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a non-cash charge of $4.5 million recorded for the amortization of discounts on our convertible promissory notes and the mark-to-market adjustment relating to warrants and embedded derivative connected to these convertible promissory notes.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The balance was offset by interest income from 2009 to 2010 attributable to higher cash and investment balances in 2010 resulting from proceeds received from our IPO in March 2010, the exercise in April 2010 of the overallotment option by our underwriters in connection with our IPO, and the private placement offering in September.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The decrease in research and development expenses from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to decreased activity in our Phase 2 clinical study designed to examine the impact of varespladib when administered to patients within 96 hours of an acute coronary syndrome event in the third quarter of 2009 as the study progressed toward completion.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Change in research and development expenses from the years ended December 31, 2008 to 2009 (in millions):
1316175_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to expenses relating to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Change in general and administrative expenses from the years ended December 31, 2008 to 2009 (in millions):
1316175_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Other expense and interest income, net.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase in other expense and interest income, net, from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to interest accrued for convertible promissory notes and amortization of note discount and debt issuance cost.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Change in other expense and interest income, net, from the years ended December 31, 2008 to 2009 (in millions):
1316175_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	In connection with the issuance of convertible promissory notes in 2008, we recorded expense related to the beneficial conversion feature of the notes in the amount of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	The expense was amortized from the issuance date of the notes to the date of their conversion into shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock in August 2008.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	No such expense was recognized in 2009 and 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt and our IPO.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had received net proceeds of approximately $119.5 million from the sale of equity securities and approximately $26.2 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $63.4 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:
1316175_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, and our capital expenditure needs.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred a net loss of approximately $40.4 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $27.8 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	The net loss is higher than cash used in operating activities by $12.6 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	The primary drivers for the difference are adjustments for non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation of approximately $702,000, amortization of note discount and debt issuance cost of approximately $769,000, issuance of $3.5 million worth of common stock in lieu of cash milestone payments due to Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd., the conversion of approximately $300,000 of accrued interest into shares of common stock upon conversion of certain convertible promissory notes, mark-to-market adjustments relating to warrant and derivative liability of $3.8 million, and increase in net operating assets and liabilities of approximately $3.6 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net cash used by investing activities was $23.4 million and was primarily driven by the purchase of short-term investments during the period.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $87.5 million and consisted of proceeds of $61.2 million received from the issuance of common stock at our IPO, the exercise of the overallotment option by our underwriters in connection with our IPO, the release of funds held in an escrow account concurrent with the closing of our IPO, proceeds of $29.6 million received from the issuance of common stock and warrants in connection with the September private placement offering, and proceeds of approximately $200,000 received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock through our ESPP, offset by approximately $3.5 million of issuance cost paid during the period.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred a net loss of approximately $12.2 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $17.2 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The net loss is higher than cash used in operating activities by $5.0 million.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	The primary drivers for the difference are adjustments for non-cash charges such as depreciation of $18,000, stock-based compensation of approximately $342,000 and amortization of note discount and debt issuance cost of approximately $216,000, a decrease in current liabilities of approximately $598,000 primarily due to payments made to CROs for the achievement of clinical milestones and a $5.0 million license fee payment made to Amgen.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $13.0 million and consisted of net proceeds of $13.3 million received from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, partially offset by approximately $274,000 in expense paid in connection with our IPO.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010:
1316175_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Operating lease obligations reflect our obligation to make payments in connection with a sublease that commenced in October 2008 and expired in January 2011, which sublease was subsequently extended through July 2011, for approximately 7,800 square feet of office space, and office equipment leases that commenced in October 2007 and will expire in June 2013.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	The above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidates in development, as these payments are not determinable.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	Under our license agreement with Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialize certain sPLA 2 inhibitors, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial objectives.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	Our obligation to pay royalties with respect to each licensed product in each country will expire upon the later of (a) 10 years following the date of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, and (b) the first date on which generic version(s) of the applicable licensed product achieve a total market share, in the aggregate, of 25% or more of the total unit sales of wholesalers to pharmacies of licensed product and all generic versions combined in the applicable country.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Also excluded from the table above are potential milestone payments on the development of A-623.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	Under our license agreement with Amgen to develop and commercialize A-623, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial objectives.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicensee in such country, or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to advance our product candidates into preclinical studies and clinical studies and as we:
1316175_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	implement new operational, financial and management information systems.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	the acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	We do not expect to generate revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	We expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in cash used in operations over the next several years.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P88_S3	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including the progress and results of our clinical studies, the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates, our revenue, if any, from successful development and commercialization of our product candidates, the costs of commercialization activities, the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical studies for other product candidates, the emergence of competing therapies and other market developments, the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights, the extent to which we acquire or invest in other product candidates and technologies, and our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone, royalty or other payments from any collaborators.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	We expect our existing resources as of the date of this report, to be sufficient to fund our planned operations, including our continued product candidate development, for at least the next 12 months.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to conduct additional or extended clinical studies and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities, if convertible, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to terminate, significantly modify or delay our development programs, reduce our planned commercialization efforts, or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1316175_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, since a majority of our investments are in short-term certificates of deposit, FDIC-insured corporate bonds and money market funds, we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any material derivative financial instruments.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our marketable securities, including those included in cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $47.8 million as of December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary.
1316175_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other-than-temporary impairment charges.
1316175_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this item are set forth beginning in Item 15 of this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
1316175_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our chief executive and financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosures controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1316175_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1316175_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1316175_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1316175_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2010 identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	This annual report does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies.

1316175_11_ITEM10_P45_S0	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the SEC.
1316175_11_ITEM10_P45_S1	Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required to furnish us with copies of all such forms which they file.
1316175_11_ITEM10_P46_S0	To our knowledge, based solely on our review of such reports or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all of the filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors, greater than 10% beneficial owners and other persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act were complied with during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P0_S0	Each of our non-employee directors receives a $40,000 annual retainer fee instead of per-meeting fees.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P0_S1	In consideration for their services, the Chairman of our Board of Directors receives an additional $40,000, the chairman of our Audit Committee receives an additional $15,000 and the chairman of our Compensation Committee receives an additional $10,000, each on an annual basis.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	In addition, since the completion of our initial public offering, each new non-employee director receives a non-qualified stock option to purchase 25,000 shares of our common stock upon joining the Board, which vests over a four-year period from the date of grant.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P1_S1	In addition, each non-employee director receives a non-qualified stock option to purchase 12,000 shares of our common stock each year, which vests over a one-year period from the date of grant.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P1_S2	Any new Chairman of our Board of Directors would receive a non-qualified stock option to purchase 45,000 shares of our common stock upon election to the Board, which would vest over a four-year period from the date of grant.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P1_S3	Our Chairman also receives a non-qualified stock option to purchase 15,000 shares of our common stock each year, which vests over a one-year period from the date of grant.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	All members of our Board of Directors are eligible to receive full reimbursement for travel expenses arising from their attendance of our board meetings.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	The following table sets forth information with respect to the compensation earned by our non-employee directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P4_S0	This section discusses our executive compensation policies and arrangements as they relate to our named executive officers who are listed in the compensation tables set forth below.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P4_S1	The following discussion should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P5_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P6_S0	The success of development companies is significantly influenced by the quality and motivation of their work forces.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P6_S1	As a result, we face significant competition for executives and other talented employees from numerous pharmaceutical research and development companies in the San Francisco Bay Area.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P6_S2	With this in mind, we strive to provide what we believe is a competitive total compensation package to our executive officers through a combination of base salary, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity compensation, in addition to broad-based employee benefits programs, in order to closely align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders, to attract talented individuals to manage and operate all aspects of our business, to reward these individuals fairly and to retain those individuals who meet our high expectations and support the achievement of our business objectives.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P7_S0	Our executive compensation program is administered by our board of directors upon recommendation of our compensation committee.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P7_S1	Our compensation committee is responsible for overseeing our executive compensation policies, plans and programs, reviewing our achievements as a company and the achievements of our individual officers, and recommending to our board of directors the type and level of compensation for our named executive officers and our directors.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P8_S0	named executive officers with those of our stockholders.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P8_S1	To achieve this goal, our compensation committee relies on compensation that is designed to attract and retain executives whose abilities are critical to our long term success, that motivates individuals to perform at their highest level and that rewards achievement.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P9_S0	The annual responsibilities of our compensation committee include the following:
1316175_11_ITEM11_P10_S0	reviewing and approving the level of equity awards, annual salary and bonuses for our named executive officers and other employees.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P11_S0	In reviewing and approving these matters, our compensation committee considers such matters as it deems appropriate, including our financial and operating performance, the alignment of interests of our executive officers and our stockholders and our ability to attract and retain qualified individuals.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P11_S1	For executive compensation decisions, including decisions relating to the grant of equity awards to our named executive officers, our compensation committee typically considers the recommendations of Mr. Truex, our Chief Executive Officer.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P11_S2	Mr. Truex also generally participates in our compensation committee s deliberations about executive compensation matters.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P11_S3	However, Mr. Truex does not participate in the deliberation or determination of his own compensation.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P12_S0	Our compensation committee has not established any formal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between current and long-term equity compensation, or between cash and non-cash compensation.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P12_S1	In determining the amount and mix of compensation elements and whether each element provides the correct incentives and rewards for performance consistent with our short-term and long-term goals and objectives, our compensation committee relies on its judgment about each individual s performance in a rapidly changing business environment rather than adopting a formulaic approach to compensatory decisions that are too narrowly responsive to short-term changes in business performance.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P12_S2	In making determinations about performance, our compensation committee does not solely rely on formal goals or metrics, but rather takes into account input from appropriate members of management with respect to an individual s performance, as well as its own observations.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P13_S0	Our compensation committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of any consulting firm or other outside advisor to assist it.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P13_S1	Prior to our IPO, in September 2009, our compensation committee engaged J. Thelander Consulting, an independent consulting firm selected by our compensation committee, to review and provide comparative data on the base salary, bonus and equity compensation of (i) chief executive officers of private biotechnology companies with funding levels between $50 to $70 million and (ii) chief executive officers and other executive officers of publicly traded biotechnology companies with a market capitalization between $220 to $375 million.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P13_S2	J. Thelander Consulting also provided a review of the board compensation of such publicly traded biotechnology companies.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P13_S3	Our compensation committee reviewed the report by J. Thelander Consulting, and in April 2010, made certain changes to our executive compensation as detailed below based, in part, on such report.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P14_S0	In December 2010, our compensation committee engaged Remedy Compensation Consulting (which has since merged with Compensia), an independent consulting firm specializing in the life sciences and technology industries, to review and provide comparative data on the base salary, bonus, equity compensation and total direct compensation of our executive officers as compared against 22 similar peer group public biotechnology companies as well as Northern Californian companies with 50-149 employees participating in the Radford Life Sciences survey.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P14_S1	Our compensation committee reviewed the report by Remedy Compensation Consulting and made certain changes to our executive compensation as detailed below, based in part, on such report.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P15_S0	The companies in the peer group were as follows:
1316175_11_ITEM11_P16_S0	J. Thelander Consulting and Remedy Compensation Consulting were retained by and reported directly to our compensation committee and do not provide any other services to the Company.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P17_S0	The base salaries of our named executive officers are primarily established based on the scope of their responsibilities and performance, taking into account comparable company data from our compensation consultants and based upon our compensation committee s understanding of compensation paid to similarly situated executives, and adjusted as necessary to recruit or retain specific individuals.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P17_S1	We typically review the base salaries of our named executive officers annually.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P17_S2	We may increase the base salary of an executive officer at other times if a change in the scope of the executive s responsibilities, such as promotion, justifies such consideration.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P17_S3	We believe that a competitive base salary relative to the companies with which we compete for executives is a necessary element of any compensation program that is designed to attract and retain talented and experienced executives.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P17_S4	We also believe that attractive base salaries can motivate and reward executives for their overall performance.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P18_S0	Base salaries are established in part based on experience, skills and expected contributions of our executives and our executives performance during the prior year.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P18_S1	In making determinations about the performance of our named executive officers, our compensation committee takes into account the achievement of corporate goals, which are set annually by our compensation committee and generally include milestones related to our preclinical and clinical studies and fundraising, as well as informal individual goals, which are position-specific and are communicated to the named executive officer over the course of the year.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P19_S0	After our IPO and taking into consideration the comparative compensation data from J. Thelander Consulting as mentioned above, in April 2010, as part of its annual review of compensation, the board of directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, approved annual base salary adjustments for Company employees, including certain of the Company s named executive officers, which became effective on May 1, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P19_S1	The adjusted base salaries for such named executive officers (and their titles at the time) are as follows:
1316175_11_ITEM11_P20_S0	In connection with Dr. Odink s promotion to Senior Vice President, Pharmaceutical Research and Development in June 2010, her annual base salary was increased from $225,000 to $250,000.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P21_S0	As part of its annual review of compensation and taking into consideration the comparative compensation data from Remedy Compensation Consulting as mentioned above, effective February 1, 2011, our board of directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, approved annual base salary adjustments for certain of our employees, including certain of our named executive officers.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P21_S1	Such adjustments were targeted towards the 50th percentile of base compensation in our peer group, based on the Remedy Compensation Consulting data, taking into consideration adjustments for promotions (including Mr. Lowe to Chief Business Officer).
1316175_11_ITEM11_P21_S2	The adjusted salaries for such named executive officers are as follows:
1316175_11_ITEM11_P22_S0	Prior to our IPO, we did not have a formal cash incentive program, although we have paid cash bonuses based on the achievement of approved operational milestones in the past.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P23_S0	In March 2010, the board of directors adopted the Company s Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, or the Bonus Plan, which applies to certain key executives, or the Executives, that are recommended by the compensation committee and selected by the board.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P23_S1	The Bonus Plan provides for bonus payments based upon the attainment of performance targets established by the board and related to financial and operational metrics with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or the Performance Goals, which would include the achievement of clinical study or operational milestones, results of clinical studies and achievement of specified financial metrics or objectives.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P23_S2	Any bonuses paid under the Bonus Plan shall be based upon objectively determinable bonus formulas that tie such bonuses to one or more performance targets relating to the Performance Goals.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P23_S3	The bonus formulas shall be adopted in each performance period by the Board and communicated to each Executive.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P23_S4	No bonuses shall be paid under the Bonus Plan unless and until the Board makes a determination with respect to the attainment of the performance objectives.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P23_S5	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjust bonuses payable under the Bonus Plan based on achievement of individual performance goals or pay bonuses (including, without limitation, discretionary bonuses) to Executives under the Bonus Plan based upon such other terms and conditions as the Board may in its discretion determine.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P24_S0	Each Executive is given a targeted bonus opportunity set for each performance period.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P24_S1	The maximum bonus payable to an Executive under the Bonus Plan is 125% of the Executive s bonus opportunity.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P25_S0	The Performance Goals will be measured at the end of each fiscal year after the Company s financial reports have been published or such other appropriate time as the board shall determine.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P25_S1	If the Performance Goals are met, payments will be made within 30 days thereafter, and if met for the previous fiscal year, not later than March 31.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P26_S0	An Executive must be employed by the Company as of the payment date in order to receive a bonus payment, provided that the board may make exceptions to this requirement, in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, in the case of an Executive s termination of employment, retirement, death or disability.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P27_S0	In April 2010, our board of directors, upon recommendation of the compensation committee, approved performance bonus awards under the Bonus Plan based upon certain operational performance, including successful negotiation and completion of the SPA with the FDA, reactivation of the IND for A-623 including submission and acceptance of the Phase II protocol, completion of equity financings with proceeds to the Company in excess of $50 million and completion and submission of our FRANCIS study including a six-month follow-up evaluation.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P27_S1	Such cash bonus awards were subject to a six-month lapsing right of repayment in the event of termination or employment.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P27_S2	Our named executive officers received the following performance cash bonus awards: Mr. Truex ($250,000), Mr. Lowe ($100,000), Dr. Hislop ($65,000) and Dr. Odink ($25,000).
1316175_11_ITEM11_P28_S0	In December 2010, our board of directors, upon recommendation of the compensation committee, approved annual cash bonuses under the Bonus Plan for performance in 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P28_S1	The annual target bonus opportunities for 2010 (expressed as a percentage of base salary and targeted towards the 50th percentile of our peer group) for our named executive officers were as follows: Mr. Truex (50%), Mr. Lowe (35%), Dr. Hislop (30%), Dr. Odink (30%) and Ms. Kilfoil (30%).
1316175_11_ITEM11_P28_S2	These bonus payments were based upon the achievement of the following corporate goals, which were equally weighted:
1316175_11_ITEM11_P29_S0	opportunistically supporting our corporate development objectives with appropriate financing and budgeting efforts.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P30_S0	In determining cash bonuses under the Bonus Plan, our board determined that 70% of the 2010 corporate goals had been achieved.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P30_S1	Each individual s target bonus was then adjusted for personal performance.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P30_S2	The following cash bonus amounts for 2010 performance were approved for our named executive officers: Mr. Truex ($148,000), Mr. Lowe ($84,000), Dr. Hislop ($67,000), Dr. Odink ($55,000) and Ms. Kilfoil ($37,000).
1316175_11_ITEM11_P31_S0	We generally grant stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers, in connection with their initial employment with us.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P31_S1	We also typically grant stock options on an annual basis as part of annual performance reviews of our employees.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P31_S2	Our compensation committee had previously established grant guidelines for our employees, other than our Chief Executive Officer (whose grants were made at the discretion of the board of directors), based on an employee s position, which guidelines specify a range of equity grant amounts expressed as a percentage of our common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, which range from 0.02% to 2.75%, depending on position.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P32_S0	We grant equity incentive compensation to our executive officers because we believe doing so will motivate our executives by aligning their interests more closely with the interests of our stockholders.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P32_S1	In the past, we granted restricted stock to certain initial employees, including Mr. Truex, as we believed that it was appropriate for our initial key employees to have an immediate equity stake, and because we believed owning restricted stock would more closely align the interests of the recipient with those of our stockholders.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P32_S2	Now that we are a more mature company, we believe it is generally more appropriate to grant stock options or restricted stock units to employees, as is the general practice at other companies with which we compete for talent, although we may continue to grant restricted stock or grant other types of equity awards when we deem it appropriate and in our stockholders best interests.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P33_S0	Prior to our initial public offering, equity incentive grants to our named executive officers and other employees were made at the discretion of our board of directors with the recommendation of our compensation committee out of our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan ).
1316175_11_ITEM11_P33_S1	In determining equity incentive grants, the compensation committee considered the grant guidelines it had established for each position, along with the equity incentives already provided to an employee.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P33_S2	Our compensation committee also considered individual performance, based on an informal evaluation of the individual s contribution to our corporate goals (which generally include milestones related to our preclinical and clinical studies and fundraising) and input received from management.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P34_S0	Following our initial public offering, all stock options continue to be granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, which is defined as the closing market price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P34_S1	We do not currently have any program, plan or practice of setting the exercise price based on a date or price other than the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P35_S0	In 2010, our board of directors granted 333,000 restricted stock units to our employees and options to purchase a total of 112,000 shares of common stock to our directors, including 213,500 restricted stock units to our named executive officers.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P35_S1	In exercising its discretion to determine the amount of each grant for recommendation to our board of directors, the compensation committee generally took into account each individual s contributions towards the achievement of our annual corporate goals.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P36_S0	first quarter 2010 operational performance on a relative scale dependent on such named executive officer s job function and responsibility.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P36_S1	The amount of each grant was based upon industry data as well as such named executive officer s current level of equity awards.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P36_S2	All of these grants were made to further motivate the recipients by aligning their interests more closely with our stockholders over the next several years by providing them with an equity interest in the company.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P37_S0	In December 2010, based upon the Remedy Compensation Consulting data, our board of directors, upon recommendation of the compensation committee, approved annual grants of stock options, effective as of January 1, 2011, to certain of our employees, including our named executive officers, which were intended to target the 50th percentile of equity awards of our peer group, after giving effect to the annual grants.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P37_S1	Our named executive officers received grants of stock options to purchase the following shares: Mr. Truex (260,000 shares), Mr. Lowe (160,000 shares), Dr. Hislop (170,000 shares), Dr. Odink (95,000 shares) and Ms. Kilfoil (100,000 shares).
1316175_11_ITEM11_P38_S0	Stock option awards provide our named executive officers and other employees with the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price, subject to their continued employment.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P38_S1	Stock options are earned on the basis of continued service and generally vest over four years, beginning with vesting as to 25% of the award on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, and pro-rata vesting monthly thereafter.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P38_S2	Stock options granted under the 2010 Plan may not be exercised prior to the award vesting in full.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P38_S3	Stock Options previously granted under the 2005 Plan may be exercised prior to the award vesting in full, subject to our right of repurchase.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P38_S4	In addition, in the past, we have also granted options to purchase smaller amounts of stock, typically fewer than 10,000 shares, which are immediately vested to recognize employee contributions, including those of our named executive officers.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P38_S5	Furthermore, we generally grant incentive stock options to employees up to the statutory limit, then non-statutory options thereafter and non-statutory options to non-employees.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P38_S6	See the section entitled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control for a discussion of the change in control provisions related to stock options.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P39_S0	Restricted stock units provide our executive officers and other employees to receive shares of stock upon the vesting of the restricted stock units, subject to their continued employment.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P39_S1	Restricted stock units generally vest in equal annual installments over four years.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P39_S2	However, we also have granted restricted stock units that vest in full after one year as a short-term incentive after our successful initial public offering.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P39_S3	See the section below entitled Potential Payments Upon Change in Control and Termination for a discussion of the change in control provisions related to restricted stock.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P40_S0	After our IPO, we adopted an equity award grant policy that formalized how we grant equity-based awards to officers and employees.

1316175_11_ITEM11_P42_S1	Our goal in providing severance and change in control benefits is to offer sufficient cash continuity protection such that our executives will focus their full time and attention on the requirements of the business rather than the potential implications for their respective positions.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P42_S2	We prefer to have certainty regarding the potential severance amounts payable to the named executive officers under certain circumstances, rather than negotiating severance at the time that a named executive officer s employment terminates.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P42_S3	We have also determined that accelerated vesting provisions in connection with a termination following a change of control are appropriate because they will encourage our restricted stock and option holders, including our named executive officers, to stay focused in such circumstances, rather than the potential implications for them.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P43_S0	All of our named executive officers are party to severance agreements that provide benefits upon termination of employment in connection with a change of control.

1316175_11_ITEM11_P47_S0	To maintain flexibility in compensating officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals, our compensation committee has not adopted a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P47_S1	Although tax deductions for some amounts that we pay to our named executive officers as compensation may be limited by section 162(m), that limitation does not result in the current payment of increased federal income taxes by us due to our significant net operating loss carry-forwards.
1316175_11_ITEM11_P47_S2	Our compensation committee may approve compensation or changes to plans, programs or awards that may cause the compensation or awards to exceed the limitation under section 162(m) if it determines that such action is appropriate and in our best interests.

1316175_11_ITEM13_P1_S0	On September 25, 2009, we entered into a stock purchase agreement, as amended to add an additional purchaser on November 3, 2009, with certain existing holders of our preferred stock for the sale of shares of our common stock equal to $20.5 million divided by the price per share at which shares of our common stock were sold to the public in our IPO minus any per-share underwriting discounts, commissions or fees.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P1_S1	We refer to this transaction as the 2009 equity financing.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P2_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the investors deposited $20.5 million into an escrow account for the purchase of the shares.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P2_S1	On December 11, 2009, we entered into a note purchase agreement and amended escrow agreement with the investors to release $3.4 million of the $20.5 million held in the escrow account and issued such investors convertible promissory notes for the released amount, which notes we refer to as the escrow notes and which are more fully described below.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P2_S2	The balance of the funds, or $17.1 million, held in the escrow account would be released simultaneously with the closing of an IPO in which the aggregate net proceeds to us (after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) were at least $50.0 million.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P2_S3	On February 24, 2010, we amended the stock purchase agreement and escrow agreement with such holders to provide that the funds held in the escrow account would be released simultaneously with the closing of an IPO in which the aggregate net proceeds to us (after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) were at least $20.0 million.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P2_S4	The funds held in the escrow account were released in connection with the closing of our IPO on March 4, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P3_S0	The following table summarizes commitments made to participate in the 2009 equity financing by any of our current directors, executive officers, Beneficial Owners or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing:
1316175_11_ITEM13_P4_S0	Numbers in this column calculated by dividing the Aggregate Consideration to be Paid upon Closing of the 2009 Equity Financing by $6.58 (which equals the price per share to the public in our initial public offering less the underwriting discounts, commissions and fees).
1316175_11_ITEM13_P5_S0	Includes approximately $6,872,948 to be paid by VantagePoint Ventures IV (Q), L.P., approximately $688,053 to be paid by VantagePoint Venture Partners IV, L.P. and approximately $25,034 to be paid by VantagePoint Venture Partners IV Principals Fund, L.P.

1316175_11_ITEM13_P9_S0	On December 11, 2009, we sold convertible promissory notes, or the escrow notes, that were secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets to purchase shares of our equity securities to certain of our existing investors for an aggregate purchase price of $3.4 million.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P9_S1	The escrow notes accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum and had a maturity date of the earlier of (i) July 17, 2010 or (ii) an event of default pursuant to the terms of the escrow notes.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P9_S2	The escrow notes were automatically convertible into common stock upon the consummation of an IPO in which the aggregate net proceeds to us (after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) were at least $50.0 million, at the price per share in which shares were sold to the public, minus any per-share underwriting discounts, commissions or fees.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P9_S3	However, if an IPO was not consummated by January 31, 2010, the escrow notes became exchangeable for exchange notes in the same principal amount plus any accrued interest thereon, which would be automatically convertible into the securities that were sold in our next equity financing at a 25% discount to the price in which such securities were sold to other investors, or they were alternatively convertible into shares of our Series B-2 convertible preferred stock in connection with a change of control of the Company.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P9_S4	In addition, each exchange note that would be issued would be accompanied by a warrant, which would be exercisable for the security into which the accompanying exchange note, if any, was converted, at the price at which that security was sold to other investors.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P9_S5	Depending on when the exchange notes are converted, each warrant may be exercisable for a number of shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) (i) 25% of the principal amount of the accompanying exchange notes, in the event the conversion occurred prior to April 1, 2010, or (ii) 50% of the principal amount of the accompanying exchange notes, in the event the conversion occurred on or after April 1, 2010, by (y) the purchase price of the securities into which the exchange note was ultimately converted.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P10_S0	two times the outstanding principal amount on such note in conjunction with the closing of such sale.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P10_S1	On February 24, 2010, the note holders waived their right to exchange the escrow notes for exchange notes and warrants unless our IPO was not consummated by March 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P10_S2	In addition, on February 24, 2010, we amended the note purchase agreement relating to the escrow notes to provide that the escrow notes were automatically convertible into common stock upon the consummation of an initial public offering in which the aggregate net proceeds to us (after underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) were at least $20.0 million.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P10_S3	The escrow notes automatically converted into common stock upon the closing of our IPO on March 4, 2010, and thus no principal or interest payments were ever made on the notes and no amounts remain due under such notes.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P10_S4	Moreover, because the escrow notes were not exchanged, no warrants were ever issued in connection with such notes.
1316175_11_ITEM13_P11_S0	The following table summarizes the participation in the 2009 escrow notes by any of our current directors, executive officers, Beneficial Owners or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons:

1316175_11_ITEM15_P6_S2	The Company was not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P16_S2	Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets; secure financing; develop a customer base; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and develop strategic alliances.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P16_S3	Although management believes that the Company will be able to successfully fund its operations, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so or that the Company will ever operate profitably.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P19_S1	Further, the Company s product candidates will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P19_S2	These activities may span many years and require substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P19_S4	The Company plans to meet its capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P19_S5	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P33_S2	Through December 31, 2010, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	Valuation techniques used to measure fair value, as required by FASB ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	The three levels of input are:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	The following is a description of the Company s valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Where quoted prices are available in an active market, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, and are classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data, the assets or liabilities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P40_S2	When quoted prices and observable inputs are unavailable, fair values are based on internally developed cash flow models and are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The internally developed cash flow models primarily use, as inputs, estimates for interest rates and discount rates including yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors, amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the assets.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	These inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets including assumptions about risk developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Other financial instruments, including accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost, which the Company believes approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	All of the Company s clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P45_S3	The Company accrues costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusts the estimates, if required, based upon the Company s ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P45_S4	The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the CROs, and adjusts the estimates, if required, on a monthly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended by each CRO.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	All material CRO contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and the Company is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain noncancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	Amounts paid in advance related to incomplete services will be refunded if a contract is terminated.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	Some contracts include additional termination payments that become due and payable if the Company terminates the contract.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P47_S2	Such additional termination payments are only recorded if a contract is terminated.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Under International Accounting Standard 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance , there are two alternatives for accounting for grants of this nature.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	They can be recorded as either i) other income, in a separate line item under operating income, or ii) a reduction in the related expense account (research and development expense or other).
1316175_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company elected to record the grants as an offset to the related research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) consists of certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income (loss).
1316175_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	Specifically, the Company includes unrealized gains (losses) on available for sale securities and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash equivalents and short-term investments in other comprehensive income (loss).
1316175_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	Comprehensive income (loss) for each period presented is set forth in the Statement of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) and Comprehensive Loss.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1316175_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company operates in only one segment.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , under which basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P54_S2	The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P54_S3	In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P54_S4	The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	Diluted EPS is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s calculation of net loss per common share:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	The following table shows weighted-average historical dilutive common share equivalents outstanding, which are not included in the above calculation, as the effect of their inclusion is anti-dilutive during each period.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	Compensation costs related to all equity instruments granted after January 1, 2006 are recognized at the grant-date fair value of the awards.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P61_S2	Additionally, the Company is required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial statements over the employees requisite service period.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Expected Term The Company s expected term represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	Expected Volatility Expected volatility is estimated using comparable public company volatility for similar terms.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has never paid dividends and has no plans to pay dividends.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing method is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	The estimated forfeiture rate is determined based on the Company s historical forfeiture rates to date.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company monitors actual expenses and periodically updates the estimate.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50, Equity , and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and recognized as expense over the related service period.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P92_S3	The Company issued convertible promissory notes, or the escrow notes, for the released amount to the investors.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P92_S4	The escrow funds, escrow notes and accrued interest were converted into shares of the Company s common stock at $6.58 per share in March 2010 upon the closing of the Company s IPO.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P92_S5	The conversion price reflected the Company s IPO price of $7.00 per share, minus per-share underwriting discount and commission fees.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P97_S4	As of December 31, 2009, 240,516, warrants remain outstanding.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	Each of the warrants contained a net issuance feature, which allowed the warrant holder to pay the exercise price of the warrant by forfeiting a portion of the exercised warrant shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P98_S1	The warrants were exercised upon the closing of the Company s IPO on March 4, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	In connection with the issuance of the 2009 notes for $10.0 million, as discussed in Note 9, the Company issued warrants to each note holder to purchase shares of its equity securities.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	Each 2009 warrant is exercisable for the security into which each 2009 note is converted, at the price at which that security is sold to other investors.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P99_S2	Depending on when the 2009 notes are converted, each 2009 warrant may be exercisable for a number of shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) (i) 25% of the principal amount of the accompanying 2009 notes, in the event the conversion occurs prior to April 1, 2010, or (ii) 50% of the principal amount of the accompanying 2009 notes, in the event the conversion occurs on or after April 1, 2010, by (y) the purchase price of the securities into which the note is ultimately converted.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P99_S3	The Company accounted for the 2009 warrants in accordance with FASB ASC 480 , Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , which requires that a financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, that, at inception, is indexed to an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity shares, regardless of the timing of the redemption feature, and may require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets, be classified as liability through the completion of the Company s IPO.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P99_S4	The Company measured the fair value of the 2009 warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on issuance date and adjusted the fair value at the end of each reporting period based on the following assumptions:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company then applied probability factors to the different possible conversion scenarios and calculated the initial fair value of the 2009 warrants to be $320,000, which amount was recorded as a discount to the 2009 notes.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	The discount was amortized as interest expense over the terms of the 2009 notes.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P100_S2	The Company re-measured the fair value of the 2009 warrants on December 31, 2009 and recorded the change in fair value in non-operating income.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P100_S3	Upon conversion of the 2009 notes into shares of common stock at the completion of the Company s IPO, the fair value of the 2009 warrants was re-measured again by the Company and the change in fair value of $1.5 million was recorded in non-operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P100_S4	Concurrent with the conversion of the 2009 notes, the Company calculated the number of warrant shares to be 357,136 based on 25% of the principal amount of the accompanying 2009 notes and the IPO price of the Company s common stock of $7.00 per share.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P100_S5	The warrant liability and unamortized discount were reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as a result of the conversion of the 2009 notes.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	which that security was sold to other investors.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	Depending on when the exchange notes are converted, each warrant may be exercisable for a number of shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) (i) 25% of the principal amount of the accompanying exchange notes, in the event the conversion occurs prior to April 1, 2010, or (ii) 50% of the principal amount of the accompanying exchange notes, in the event the conversion occurs on or after April 1, 2010, by (y) the purchase price of the securities into which the exchange note is ultimately converted.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Company accounts for the potential issuance of the warrants in accordance with FASB ASC 480.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company measured the fair value of its derivative using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility of 78%, risk-free interest rate of 2.34% and expected term of five years.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	The Company then applied probability factors to the different possible exchange and conversion scenarios and calculated the fair value of the warrants to be $86,845, which amount was recorded as a discount to the escrow notes.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P103_S2	The discount was amortized as interest expense over the terms of the escrow notes.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P103_S3	The escrow notes were converted into shares of the Company s common stock upon the closing of its IPO.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P103_S4	As a result of the conversion taking place prior to the exchange of the escrow notes into exchange notes, the Company s obligation to issue the warrants was eliminated.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P103_S5	Consequently, the Company reclassified the unamortized discount into additional paid-in capital and reduced the fair value of the warrant liability to zero.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	On September 24, 2010, the Company closed a private placement transaction with certain accredited investors pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 10,500,000 units at a purchase price of $3.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional 0.40 shares of common stock.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	Each warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time until September 24, 2015 at a per share exercise price of $3.30, subject to certain adjustments as specified in the warrant.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company valued the warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility of 64%, risk-free interest rate of 1.37% and expected term of five years.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P105_S1	The fair value of the warrants was calculated to be $5.3 million and has been recorded in additional paid-in capital.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P105_S2	As of December 31, 2010, 4,200,000 warrants remain outstanding.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	Each of the warrants contains a net issuance feature, which allows the warrant holder to pay the exercise price of the warrant by forfeiting a portion of the exercised warrant shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	The 2009 notes and the escrow notes discussed in Note 9 contained a contingent automatic redemption feature and a contingent put option that meet the definition of an embedded derivative as defined in FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , because these notes contain features with implicit or explicit terms that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of other exchanges required by a contract in a manner similar to a derivative instrument.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P107_S1	As a result, the Company evaluated these embedded derivative features under the guidance of FASB ASC 815 and determined that the embedded derivative features should be separated from the 2009 notes and escrow notes and recognized as derivative instruments.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	Pursuant to the guidance of FASB ASC 815, if a hybrid instrument contains more than one embedded derivative feature that would individually warrant separate accounting as a derivative instrument, those embedded derivative features shall be bundled together as a single, compound embedded derivative that shall then be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the host contract unless a fair value election is made.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P108_S1	Since the Company may not make a fair value election, the contingent automatic redemption and the contingent put option should be bundled together as a single, compound embedded derivative and separated from the 2009 notes and escrow notes.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P108_S2	The Company recognized the bundled embedded derivative as a derivative liability with initial and subsequent measurements at fair value and changes in fair value recorded in earnings.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P108_S3	Upon conversion of the 2009 notes and escrow notes into shares of common stock at the completion of the Company s IPO, the Company re-measured the fair value of the embedded derivative and recorded a charge of $2.5 million in non-operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company s 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan ) was adopted by the board of directors in January 2005.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	Amounts expensed during the remaining vesting period will be determined based on the fair value at the time of vesting.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan, or the 401(k) Plan.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P141_S1	The Company has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards in the accompanying financial statements and has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	The significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 is as follows:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	Because of the Company s recent history of operating losses, management believes that the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits are currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P145_S2	The net valuation allowance increased by $4,690,989 and $15,502,184 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, and $41,641,291 for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	Net operating losses and tax return credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2010, are as follows:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, and similar state provisions.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	The Company has not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC has occurred.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P147_S2	The effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards attributable to periods before the change.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1,375,594, all of which would not currently affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company s deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	The Company did not anticipate any significant change to the unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P148_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	The Company would classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, if applicable.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	There was no interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P149_S2	The tax years 2004 through 2010 remain open to examination by one or more major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized net tax benefits will significantly change prior to the end of 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company engaged an outside service provider where one of the founders is employed for clinical management services.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P151_S1	In consideration for the services rendered, the Company paid the following fees:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $519,386 payable to this organization for services performed during the year.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after December 31, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P153_S1	The Company did not have any material subsequent events that require adjustment or disclosure in these financial statements.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	There were no recent accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted by the Company that are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

1316175_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	All capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	The effective date of this Amendment No. 1 shall be December 15, 2010.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	Except as expressly amended hereby, the Plan remains in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Board of Directors of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Anthera ) established this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to aid Anthera s directors, officers and employees in making ethical and legal decisions when conducting Anthera s business and performing their day-to-day duties.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P172_S0	Anthera s Board of Directors or a committee of the Board is responsible for administering the Code.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P172_S1	The Board of Directors has delegated day-to-day responsibility for administering and interpreting the Code to a Compliance Officer.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P172_S2	Our Chief Financial Officer has been appointed Anthera s Compliance Officer under this Code.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	Anthera expects its directors, officers and employees to exercise reasonable judgment when conducting Anthera s business.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P173_S1	Anthera encourages its directors, officers and employees to refer to this Code frequently to ensure that they are acting within both the letter and the spirit of this Code.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P173_S2	Anthera also understands that this Code will not contain the answer to every situation you may encounter or every concern you may have about conducting Anthera s business ethically and legally.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P173_S3	In these situations, or if you otherwise have questions or concerns about this Code, Anthera encourages each officer and employee to speak with his or her supervisor (if applicable) or, if you are uncomfortable doing that, with the Compliance Officer under this Code, or another member of our Finance Department.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P174_S0	This Code has two sections which follow this Introduction.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P175_S0	The first section, Standards of Conduct , contains the actual guidelines that our directors, officers and employees are expected to adhere to in the conduct of Anthera s business.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P175_S1	The second section, Compliance Procedures , contains specific information about how this Code functions including who administers the Code, who can provide guidance under the Code and how violations may be reported, investigated and punished.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P175_S2	This section also contains a discussion about waivers of and amendments to this Code.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P176_S0	Anthera s directors, officers and employees generally have other legal and contractual obligations to Anthera.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P176_S1	This Code is not intended to reduce or limit the other obligations that you may have to Anthera.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P176_S2	Instead, the standards in this Code should be viewed as the minimum standards that Anthera expects from its directors, officers and employees in the conduct of Anthera s business.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P177_S0	Anthera recognizes and respects the right of its directors, officers and employees to engage in outside activities which they may deem proper and desirable, provided that these activities do not impair or interfere with the performance of their duties to the Company or their ability to act in Anthera s best interests.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P177_S1	In most, if not all, cases this will mean that our directors, officers and employees must avoid situations that present a potential or actual conflict between their personal interests and Anthera s interests.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	A conflict of interest occurs when a director s, officer s or employee s personal interest interferes with Anthera s interests.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P178_S1	Conflicts of interest may arise in many situations.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P178_S2	For example, conflicts of interest may occur when a director, officer or employee or his or her immediate family member receives some personal benefit (whether improper or not) as a result of the director s, officer s or employee s position with Anthera.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P178_S3	Each individual s situation is different and in evaluating his or her own situation, a director, officer or employee will have to consider many factors.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P179_S0	Any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest should be reported promptly to the Compliance Officer.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P179_S1	The Compliance Officer may notify the Board of Directors or a committee thereof as he or she deems appropriate.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	Anthera seeks to conduct its business in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P180_S1	No director, officer or employee shall engage in any unlawful activity in conducting Anthera s business or in performing his or her day-to-day company duties, nor shall any director, officer or employee instruct others to do so.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	Employees, officers and directors owe a duty to Anthera to advance its legitimate business interests when the opportunity to do so arises.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P181_S1	Each employee, officer and director is prohibited from:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	using Anthera s property or information or his or her position for improper personal gain.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	Confidential information generated and gathered in Anthera s business plays a vital role in Anthera s business, prospects and ability to compete.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P183_S1	Confidential information includes (i) all non-public information that might be of use to competitors or harmful to the Company or its customers if disclosed, (ii) information that is disclosed by or on behalf of Anthera to directors, officers or employees in connection with services provided to Anthera by such directors, officers and employees, or (iii) non-public information that is developed or generated by such directors, officer and employees in the course of providing such services.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P183_S2	Directors, officers and employees may not disclose or distribute Anthera s confidential information, except when disclosure is authorized by Anthera or required by applicable law, rule or regulation or pursuant to an applicable legal proceeding.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P183_S3	Directors, officers and employees shall use confidential information solely for legitimate company purposes, except to the extent authorized by Anthera s Board of Directors.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P183_S4	Directors, officers and employees must return all of Anthera s confidential and/or proprietary information in their possession to Anthera when they cease to be employed by or to otherwise serve Anthera.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	Competing vigorously, yet lawfully, with competitors and establishing advantageous, but fair, business relationships with customers and suppliers is a part of the foundation for long-term success.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P184_S1	However, unlawful and unethical conduct, which may lead to short-term gains, may damage a company s reputation and long-term business prospects.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P184_S2	Accordingly, it is Anthera s policy that directors, officers and employees must endeavor to deal ethically and lawfully with Anthera s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees in all business dealings on Anthera s behalf.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P184_S3	No director, officer or employee should take unfair advantage of another person in business dealings on Anthera s behalf through the abuse of privileged or confidential information or through improper manipulation, concealment or misrepresentation of material facts.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	The integrity, reliability and accuracy in all material respects of Anthera s books, records and financial statements is fundamental to Anthera s continued and future business success.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	No director, officer or employee may cause Anthera to enter into a transaction with the intent to document or record it in a deceptive or unlawful manner.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P186_S1	In addition, no director, officer or employee may create any false or artificial documentation or book entry for any transaction entered into by Anthera.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P186_S2	Similarly, officers and employees who have responsibility for accounting and financial reporting matters have a responsibility to accurately record all funds, assets and transactions on Anthera s books and records.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	Anthera is committed to providing its shareholders with information about its financial condition and results of operations as required by the securities laws of the United States.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P187_S1	It is Anthera s policy that the reports and documents it files with or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and its earnings releases and similar public communications made by Anthera, include fair, timely and understandable disclosure.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	responsible for these filings and disclosures, including Anthera s principal executive, financial and accounting officers, must use reasonable judgment and perform their responsibilities honestly, ethically and objectively in order to ensure that this disclosure policy is fulfilled.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	Anthera s Disclosure Committee are primarily responsible for monitoring Anthera s public disclosure.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P189_S0	All directors, officers and employees will be supplied with a copy of the Code upon beginning service at Anthera.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P189_S1	Updates of the Code will be provided from time to time.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P189_S2	A copy of the Code is also available to all directors, officers and employees by requesting one from the human resources department or by accessing the company s website at www.anthera.com.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	Anthera s management, under the supervision of its Board of Directors or a committee thereof or, in the case of accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, the Audit Committee, shall take reasonable steps from time to time to (i) monitor and (ii) when appropriate, impose and enforce appropriate disciplinary measures for violations of the Code.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	Disciplinary measures for violations of the Code may include, but are not limited to, counseling, oral or written reprimands, warnings, probation or suspension with or without pay, demotions, reductions in salary, termination of employment or service and restitution.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	Anthera s management shall periodically report to the Board of Directors or a committee thereof on these compliance efforts including, without limitation, periodic reporting of alleged violations of the Code and the actions taken with respect to any such violation.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	Every employee is encouraged to act proactively by asking questions, seeking guidance and reporting suspected violations of the Code and other policies and procedures of Anthera, as well as any violation or suspected violation of applicable law, rule or regulation arising in the conduct of the Anthera s business or occurring on Anthera s property.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P193_S1	If any employee believes that actions have taken place, may be taking place, or may be about to take place that violate or would violate the Code, he or she is obligated to bring the matter to the attention of Anthera.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	The best starting point for an officer or employee seeking advice on ethics-related issues or reporting potential violations of the Code will usually be his or her supervisor.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P194_S1	However, if the conduct in question involves his or her supervisor, if the employee has reported the conduct in question to his or her supervisor and does not believe that he or she has dealt with it properly, or if the officer or employee does not feel that he or she can discuss the matter with his or her supervisor, the employee may raise the matter with the Compliance Officer or the Finance Department.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	Any officer or employee may communicate with the Compliance Officer or the Finance Department by any of the following methods:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	By phoning the employee feedback line (the Feedback Line ) which we have established for receipt of questions and reports of potential violations of the Code.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P196_S1	The Feedback Line may be reached at (866) 265-1760 and calls may be made anonymously as set forth below under Reporting; Anonymity; Retaliation .
1316175_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	Any concerns or questions regarding potential violations of the Code, any other company policy or procedure or applicable law, rules or regulations involving accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters should be directed to the Audit Committee or a designee of the Audit Committee.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P197_S1	Officers and employees may communicate with the Audit Committee or its designee:
1316175_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	Officers and employees may use the above methods to communicate anonymously with the Audit Committee.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	Employees must not use these reporting channels in bad faith or in a false or frivolous manner.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P199_S1	Further, employees should not use the Reporting Line to report grievances that do not involve the Code or other ethics-related issues.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	When reporting suspected violations of the Code, Anthera prefers that officers and employees identify themselves in order to facilitate Anthera s ability to take appropriate steps to address the report, including conducting any appropriate investigation.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	However, Anthera also recognizes that some people may feel more comfortable reporting a suspected violation anonymously.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	If an officer or employee wishes to remain anonymous, he or she may do so, and Anthera will use reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of the reporting person subject to applicable law, rule or regulation or to any applicable legal proceedings.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	In the event the report is made anonymously, however, Anthera may not have sufficient information to look into or otherwise investigate or evaluate the allegations.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P201_S2	Accordingly, persons who make reports anonymously should provide as much detail as is reasonably necessary to permit Anthera to evaluate the matter(s) set forth in the anonymous report and, if appropriate, commence and conduct an appropriate investigation.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	Anthera expressly forbids any retaliation against any officer or employee who, acting in good faith, reports suspected misconduct.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	Any person who participates in any such retaliation is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	No waiver of any provisions of the Code for the benefit of a director or an executive officer (which includes without limitation, for purposes of this Code, Anthera s principal executive, financial and accounting officers) shall be effective unless (i) approved by the Board of Directors or, if permitted, a committee thereof, and (ii) if applicable, such waiver is promptly disclosed to Anthera s shareholders in accordance with applicable United States securities laws and/or the rules and regulations of the exchange or system on which the Company s shares are traded or quoted, as the case may be.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	Any waivers of the Code for other employees may be made by the Compliance Officer, the Board of Directors or, if permitted, a committee thereof.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P205_S0	All amendments to the Code must be approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and, if applicable, must be promptly disclosed to Anthera s shareholders in accordance with applicable United States securities laws and/or the rules and regulations of the exchange or system on which the Company s shares are traded or quoted, as the case may be.
1316175_11_ITEM15_P206_S0	No. 333-170433 and No. 333-170099 on Form S-1, of our report dated March 7, 2011 (which report expresses an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company s development stage status), relating to the financial statements of Anthera Pharmaceutical Inc., appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2010.

1316175_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	We currently have one Phase 2 clinical program, blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	Two of our product candidates, varespladib and varespladib sodium, are designed to inhibit a novel enzyme target known as secretory phospholipase A 2 , or sPLA 2 .
1316175_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Elevated levels of sPLA 2 have been implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as in chronic diseases, including stable coronary artery disease, or CAD.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition, blisibimod targets elevated levels of B-lymphocyte stimulator, or BLyS, also known as B-cell Activating Factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, lupus nephritis, or LN, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sj gren's Syndrome, Graves' Disease and others.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	On March 9, 2012, an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended stopping the Company's VISTA-16 clinical study for varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	After review of the totality of evidence, including the emerging unblinded data from VISTA-16, the DSMB was unanimous in its view that there was cogent evidence to recommend early termination of the trial.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	According to the DSMB, the chief reason is the inability of VISTA-16 to detect a statistically significant benefit of the drug on the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints even if the trial continues to its scheduled termination.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	We believe that the DSMB's decision was based on the belief that the risk profile of the drug would not outweigh any benefit.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P3_S4	As a result, we have closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy immediately.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P3_S5	We have also closed enrollment in our IMPACTS-2 clinical study for varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	While data continues to be made available to us, and while we continue to assess these data, based on the DSMB recommendation we expect that we will not engage in any further development activities of our sPLA 2 portfolio.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware in 2004.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 25801 Industrial Boulevard, Suite B, Hayward, California 94545 and our telephone number is (510) 856-5600.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our products in all indications and markets, with the exception of Japan where Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains commercial rights to our sPLA 2 product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our current development plans are focused on acute treatment and orphan indications that may provide an accelerated and cost-efficient path to regulatory approval and commercialization.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	We believe that certain of these markets can be commercialized through a limited specialty sales force.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, we believe that our product candidates can also address market opportunities in chronic indications and we may seek development and commercialization partners to address chronic, non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The inflammatory process is a powerful and essential early line of defense for protection against injury and to repair body tissue.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	As a result, it is tightly regulated by the body to ensure appropriate activation and prompt resolution.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	However, under certain circumstances, the normal process can malfunction, leading to acute or chronic inflammation or inappropriate activation directed against the body's own tissues.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	All of these circumstances can cause significant damage to cells and tissues, leading to a range of inflammatory disorders, such as cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Building upon our knowledge of the regulation of inflammatory pathways and the growing body of evidence that links inflammation to multiple disease states, we believe that we have developed a leadership position in the field of sPLA 2 inhibition.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our sPLA 2 inhibitors have been studied in a number of inflammatory disorders in multiple therapeutic areas.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	The effect of our sPLA 2 inhibitors on sPLA 2 concentration and activity have been implicated in acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	We currently have the two most advanced sPLA 2 inhibitors in clinical development.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our first product candidate, varespladib (an oral prodrug of varespladib sodium), is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of sPLA 2 enzymes, including type IIa, V and X. The American Heart Association defines acute coronary syndrome as any group of clinical symptoms related to acute myocardial ischemia, including unstable angina, or UA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Varespladib, when combined with Lipitor (atorvastatin), is one of only a few therapeutics in development with the potential to offer a unique and synergistic treatment approach targeting systemic inflammation, elevated lipid levels and the inflammatory path of atherosclerosis as part of physician-directed standard of care.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Through its novel mechanism of action, varespladib may have applications in a broad range of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Based on the successful results of our completed Phase 2b, FRANCIS, clinical study, we initiated enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical study, VISTA-16, in patients with acute coronary syndrome in June 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	In March 2012, we closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy based on the recommendation from an independent data safety monitoring board.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our second product candidate, varespladib sodium, is an intravenously administered inhibitor of sPLA 2 ,which we may evaluate in a Phase 2 clinical study for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Acute chest syndrome is a form of inflammation-induced lung failure and is the most common cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Given that there are currently no approved drugs for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, we have received orphan drug designation and fast track status from the FDA for varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	In March 2012, we closed enrollment in our IMPACTS-2 study for varespladib sodium and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy based on the recommendation from an independent data safety monitoring board.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We also have a broad series of additional sPLA 2 inhibitors designed with distinct chemical scaffolds in preclinical development.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	These product candidates are intended to provide new sPLA 2 inhibitors for our existing target indications as well as new candidates for other therapeutic areas.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our lead candidate within the series, A-003, is chemically distinct from varespladib sodium and varespladib and has shown increased potency against the target enzymes and higher drug exposure after dosing in preclinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	As a result, A-003 may confer beneficial pharmacodynamic effects in patients and can be formulated for oral or intravenously administered use.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	We have explored the use of our varespladib and varespladib sodium sPLA 2 inhibitors as both topical and inhalation therapies in animal models for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and asthma, respectively.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Results from a standard mouse model of edema demonstrated that topically administered varespladib was equivalent to the marketed immunosuppressant Elidel in resolving inflammation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	allergen-induced asthma, inhaled varespladib sodium demonstrated an improvement in lung function similar to inhaled steroids.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	While data continues to be made available to us, and while we continue to assess these data, based on the DSMB recommendation to stop the VISTA-16 study for varespladib, we expect that we will not engage in any further development activities of our sPLA 2 portfolio.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	sPLA 2 is a family of enzymes directly involved in the acute and chronic steps of an inflammatory response.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	sPLA 2 activity is highly elevated during the early stages of inflammation, and its acute effects serve to substantially amplify the inflammatory process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The sPLA 2 enzyme catalyzes the first step in the arachidonic acid pathway of inflammation, one of the main metabolic processes for the production of inflammatory mediators, which, when amplified, are responsible for causing damage to cells and tissue.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Specifically, sPLA 2 breaks down phospholipids that result in the formation of fatty acids such as arachidonic acid.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	Arachidonic acid is subsequently metabolized to form several pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic molecules.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	In cardiovascular diseases such as acute coronary syndrome, elevated levels of sPLA 2 mass and sPLA 2 activity have acute and chronic implications on disease progression and patient outcomes.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	In published studies and our own clinical studies, significant elevations in sPLA 2 activity and mass have been seen from 24 hours to two weeks following an event constituting acute coronary syndrome and can persist for up to an additional 12 weeks thereafter.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Shortly after a heart attack, sPLA 2 is dramatically elevated, amplifying inflammation that is associated with more frequent and secondary cardiovascular events.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	This resulting elevated level of inflammation is problematic for acute coronary syndrome patients who are already at higher risk of complications during the weeks following their initial event.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	For example, increased inflammation can destabilize vulnerable vascular lesions or atherosclerotic plaque, destroy damaged but viable cardiac cells and adversely modify lipids, any of which may lead to the recurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Historical and recent clinical results have demonstrated circulating levels of sPLA 2 are significantly correlated with a well-established inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, or CRP.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	These and other clinical studies have also demonstrated that sPLA 2 independently predicts coronary events in patients that have recently experienced an acute coronary syndrome and patients with stable CAD independent of other standard risk factors.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	In a stable cardiovascular patient, sPLA 2 not only sustains chronic vascular inflammation as discussed earlier, but it also adversely remodels lipoproteins such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C. sPLA 2 interacts with LDL-C in a series of reactions that result in smaller, more pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory LDL-C particles.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Moreover, these modified lipoproteins have a reduced affinity for LDL-C receptors, which are responsible for removal of cholesterol from the body.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	As a result, LDL-C remains in circulation longer and has a greater tendency to deposit in the artery wall.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	This increased LDL-C deposition and sustained chronic vascular inflammation may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	The family of sPLA 2 enzymes includes at least three forms that play a role in inflammation and the development of cardiovascular disease or lung injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	While sPLA 2 enzymes are a member of the broader phospholipase family that includes a lipoprotein associated phospholipase A 2 , or Lp-PLA 2 , there are important distinctions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	Although both are present in blood, Lp-PLA 2 is mostly bound to LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, while sPLA 2 enzymes are not.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	Based on our clinical studies, we believe that our sPLA 2 inhibitor, varespladib, can be distinguished from other PLA 2 enzyme inhibitors such as those targeted at inhibiting Lp-PLA 2 because varespladib treatment:
1316175_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	lowers circulating small, dense and pro-atherogenic, or plaque-building LDL-C particles, while Lp-PLA 2 inhibition has not demonstrated similar effects; and reduces plaque volume and aneurysms in standard rodent models of atherosclerosis and has demonstrated synergistic reductions of plaque volume in standard rodent models of atherosclerosis when used in combination with statins.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	In diseases such as acute chest syndrome, a very serious form of lung injury associated with sickle cell disease, sPLA 2 acts acutely on a number of substrates that amplify the inflammatory disease process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder which leads to the structural alteration, or "sickling," of otherwise healthy red blood cells.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Patients with sickle cell disease experience periods of intense pain known as vaso-occlusive crisis, or VOC, as structurally altered red blood cells bind together and occlude small blood vessels that supply blood and nutrients to vital tissue and bone.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	sPLA 2 levels are dramatically elevated in sickle cell patients during an episode of VOC as well as within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of acute chest syndrome.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	During VOC, microscopic fat emboli, or droplets of fat from the bone marrow, are prevalent and can break free and become lodged in the lung.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	These emboli are substrates for sPLA 2 enzymes and provide fuel for an already established inflammatory response, increasing lung injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, sPLA 2 has been demonstrated to degrade human lung surfactant, a component necessary in maintaining appropriate lung function, which further complicates lung injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	We believe that early intervention with a drug designed to inhibit sPLA 2 activity may offer a unique opportunity to reduce the complications associated with certain inflammatory diseases such as acute coronary syndrome in cardiovascular patients and acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	BAFF has been associated with a wide range of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases including lupus, LN, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sj gren's Syndrome, Graves' Disease and others.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	The role of BAFF in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has recently been validated in multiple clinical studies with other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	We are advancing the development of our BAFF inhibitor molecule, blisibimod, a selective peptibody, to exploit its broad potential clinical utility in autoimmune diseases.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	We have worldwide rights to blisibimod in all potential indications.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	We have initiated PEARL-SC, the Phase 2b clinical study of blisibimod, for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Lupus patients suffer from a chronic autoimmune disease, which often leads to severe skin rash, fatigue, joint pain, major organ complications and cardiovascular disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Blisibimod demonstrates anti-BAFF activity and has shown statistically significant reductions in B-cells in two Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	We believe blisibimod may offer a number of potential differentiations over the currently marketed BAFF antagonist, Benlysta, as well as other novel B-cell directed therapies including:
1316175_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	convenient, at-home, patient-administered subcutaneous dosing with a range of dosing frequencies including monthly and weekly; the ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF; a Phase 2 clinical design which utilizes more stringent restrictions to background medication, a shorter time-point to the primary endpoint, and requiring larger disease reduction in the SELENA/SLEDAI clinical efficacy measurement tool; and a novel molecular structure, which may confer differentiating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, potentially providing efficacy and dosing benefits, as well as manufacturing benefits and lower cost of goods based on a bacterial fermentation manufacturing process; and multiple binding domains achieve highest reported affinity for inhibition of BAFF.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	We have focused our product development programs on anti-inflammatory therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases, lupus and other serious diseases for which we believe that current treatments are either inadequate or non-existent.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our current product development programs are listed in the table below and can be found online at clinicaltrials.gov .
1316175_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	We have historically spent a significant portion of our resources on research and development.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our research and development expenses were $85.3, $29.5, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Varespladib is an orally administered pro-drug of varespladib sodium, which is a broad-spectrum, once-daily inhibitor of the IIa, V and X iso-forms of the sPLA 2 enzyme that has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and lipid-modulating treatment effects in multiple clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	We commenced the Phase 3 VISTA-16 study to evaluate varespladib in combination with atorvastatin therapy, for the short-term (16-week) treatment of acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	We have an agreement with the FDA on a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA for the VISTA-16 study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	During 2011, we revised operational aspects of our SPA and received agreement from the FDA on June 29, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	A SPA provides an opportunity for the clinical study sponsor to receive feedback from the FDA regarding the potential adequacy of a clinical study to meet certain regulatory and scientific requirements if conducted in accordance with the SPA agreement.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	A SPA is not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	To date, over 3,000 patients and healthy volunteers in at least 15 previous clinical studies have been exposed to varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Varespladib was generally well-tolerated in studies where patients were exposed to a maximum of 48 weeks of therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Varespladib has been studied in combination with Lipitor (atorvastatin) in our Phase 2b clinical study, FRANCIS, in acute coronary syndrome patients and two earlier Phase 2 clinical studies, PLASMA and PLASMA-2, in stable CAD patients, the majority of whom were on various statin therapies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	We currently have all worldwide product rights to varespladib, except in Japan where Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	We originally licensed our sPLA 2 inhibitor portfolio, including varespladib and varespladib sodium, from Eli Lilly Company, or Eli Lilly, and Shionogi Co., Ltd. in July 2006.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	In March 2012, an independent data safety monitoring board recommended stopping the Company's VISTA-16 clinical study for varespladib due to a lack of efficacy that could not be reasonably overcome in the remainder of the trial.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	As a result, the Company has closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	Based on the DSMB recommendation we expect that we will not engage in any further development activities of our sPLA 2 portfolio.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	According to the American Heart Association, over 18 million people in the United States have experienced a cardiac event that constitutes acute coronary syndrome and an estimated 1.5 million Americans will have a new or recurrent heart attack.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	In addition, the American Heart Association estimates that worldwide, cardiovascular disease kills an estimated 17.5 million people each year.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	According to British Heart Foundation statistics, CAD, which often leads to acute coronary syndrome or heart attacks, accounts for 1.9 million deaths in Europe annually.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	According to the World Health Organization, or the WHO, cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the western world and a major cause of hospital admissions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	In addition, the American Heart Association provides that for people over the age of 40, 20% of them will die within one year following an initial heart attack, and over 33% of them will die within the first five years of an initial heart attack.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	to increase given an aging population, as well as the rising epidemics of diabetes and obesity, two conditions known to increase the risk of acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	The American Heart Association defines acute coronary syndrome as any group of clinical signs and symptoms related to acute myocardial ischemia.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	Acute myocardial ischemia can often present as chest pain due to insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle that results from CAD.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Acute coronary syndrome covers a spectrum of clinical conditions that include ST-elevated myocardial infarction, or STEMI, non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction, or NSTEMI, and UA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Both STEMI and NSTEMI are forms of a heart attack, where damage to the heart muscle occurs due to ischemia, which is lack of blood flow to tissues due to a blockage of a vessel.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	Typically, UA results in chest pain from ischemia, but does not cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Furthermore, for any patient who experiences an acute coronary syndrome, the risk of a secondary MACE is significantly increased immediately following the initial event.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	Large clinical outcome studies such as MIRACL and PROVE-IT have previously reported, and data from our own FRANCIS Phase 2b clinical study supports, the 16-week placebo rate of secondary MACE in acute coronary syndrome patients to be between 6.1% and 14.8%.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	Recent published clinical studies involving anti-platelet and anti-coagulant therapies in ACS patients including PLATO, APPRAISE-2 TRA-CER and ATLAS-ACS have reported 16-week placebo rate of secondary MACE in acute coronary syndrome patients to be between approximately 4.5% and 8.0%.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	These studies do not include the incidence of unstable angina as part of the composite end point.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P55_S4	Unstable angina, included as a component of the MACE endpoint in the VISTA-16 clinical study, represented approximately 30% of the total MACE at 16 weeks in the FRANCIS clinical study with varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Current treatments for CAD other than interventional procedures include a variety of medications such as aspirin, statins, anti-platelet and anti-coagulant therapeutics.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	These medications are used to offer both acute and chronic benefits to patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	For patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, therapeutics are administered quickly to improve blood flow to the heart and limit the risk associated with continued ischemia and thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot inside a vessel, which obstructs blood flow.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	In addition, interventional procedures and other medications, such as statins that are initiated early primarily for lipid benefits, are continued in an attempt to provide chronic protection against secondary MACE through improvement in lipid profiles such as lowering LDL-C.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	In patients experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, the relationship between higher levels of inflammation, as measured by CRP, sPLA 2 and interleukin-6, or IL-6, and increased risk for MACE has been demonstrated extensively.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	In numerous clinical studies with a variety of therapeutic interventions, reductions in CRP have been correlated with reductions in subsequent MACE.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	CRP is one of the most commonly used marker of inflammation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	It has been correlated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in multiple clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Although a causative role for CRP has not been established, inflammation is known to promote acute coronary syndrome and CRP may play a direct role in both vascular inflammation as well as plaque rupture.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Statins reduce the level of CRP and other markers of inflammation in patients with stable CAD.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	In April 2001, the Journal of the American Medical Association published results from the MIRACL study describing the effect of statins in acute coronary syndrome, where inflammation is greatly elevated.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	3,086 were randomized within 96 hours of their index event to treatment with high-dose Lipitor (atorvastatin) or placebo.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	Lipitor (atorvastatin) significantly reduced secondary MACE after 16 weeks.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	A second paper from the same study, published in Circulation in 2003, described the rapid decline of inflammatory markers in patients on statin treatment that was associated with reduced MACE.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	After 16 weeks, Lipitor (atorvastatin) reduced CRP levels by 34%.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	In 2005, the New England Journal of Medicine published data from the PROVE-IT study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	A total of 3,745 patients were randomized to either intensive statin therapy with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) or moderate statin therapy with 40 mg pravastatin.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Patients with low CRP or LDL-C had fewer MACE than those with higher levels of either CRP or LDL-C. Patients who had both LDL-C 70 mg/dL and CRP 1 mg/L had the fewest number of secondary events overall.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	The direct relationship between lower LDL-C levels and reduced risk for major cardiovascular events has been consistently demonstrated for over a decade in 18 outcome studies involving over 119,000 patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	Results from large clinical outcome studies demonstrate achieving incrementally lower LDL-C levels reduces the risk of future cardiovascular events and provides continued patient benefit.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	As a result, the lipid treatment guidelines have been revised to establish more aggressive LDL-C treatment goals over time.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P67_S3	The most recent guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III, or NCEP ATP III, updated in 2004 advocate treatment goals for LDL-C below 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients and 70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P67_S4	Given the breadth of more recent clinical data available, we believe that future treatment guidelines from the NCEP will likely establish new LDL-C treatment goals that apply the 70 mg/dL standard or lower to a broader population of at-risk patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Patients enrolled in our FRANCIS Phase 2b clinical study and our Phase 3 acute coronary syndrome study represent high-risk patients as defined by the NCEP.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	III guideline categories of high-risk and very high-risk do not achieve these recommended lipid goals despite maximum lipid-lowering therapies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	Moreover, substantial residual risk remains even among the group of patients who do achieve these aggressive LDL-C goals suggesting additional biological mechanisms, including inflammation, may be relevant.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	This is exemplified in a November 2008 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine that detailed the results from a 17,000 patient, multinational, primary prevention study named JUPITER.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	The study randomized patients with relatively normal levels of LDL-C, but elevated levels of inflammation based on CRP, to statin or placebo therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P70_S2	The JUPITER study was stopped early because those patients randomized to statin therapy demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in CRP, which also translated to a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events versus those on placebo.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P70_S3	The reduction in events was well in excess of that which would be predicted from historical data evaluating LDL-C reductions alone.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P70_S4	While these results were generated in a primary prevention setting, we believe that the benefits of reducing inflammation may prove to be even more meaningful in settings where patients are in a hyper-inflammatory state, such as following an acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P70_S5	As a result of these studies, we believe that there is a substantial need for novel therapies that provide meaningful reductions in inflammation while also improving LDL-C levels in high-risk cardiovascular patients beyond the benefits of statin therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P70_S6	Therefore, it is our belief that targeting inflammation and elevated LDL-C with sPLA 2 inhibition during the early phase of an acute coronary syndrome will further improve patient outcomes.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	In 2008, based on the results from Phase 2 stable CAD studies, as discussed below, we met with the FDA to discuss the next steps of clinical development of varespladib during our end of Phase 2 meeting.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	As a result of that meeting and the results from our Phase 2b acute coronary syndrome study, we submitted a SPA to the FDA for the Phase 3 VISTA-16 study of varespladib for the short-term (16-week) treatment of patients who have recently experienced an acute coronary syndrome.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	We reached agreement with the FDA on all aspects of the VISTA-16 study protocol, including patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, study size, statistical considerations, efficacy endpoints, study duration, randomization and lipid management strategies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	In June 2010, we initiated enrollment in the VISTA-16 clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	Pursuant to our SPA agreement with the FDA, our multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 acute coronary syndrome VISTA-16 study will enroll up to 6,500 patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P72_S2	The study was conducted in up to 17 countries and up to 500 centers.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	The primary endpoint of the VISTA-16 study was to determine whether 16 weeks of once-daily treatment with varespladib plus a dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin) is superior to placebo plus Lipitor (atorvastatin) in the time to the first occurrence of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or documented UA with objective evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization as defined by recent FDA draft guidance.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	On July 22, 2009, the Center for Drug Education and Research division of the FDA issued draft recommendations for standardized definitions for cardiovascular outcomes trials.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	The VISTA-16 clinical study endpoint definitions conform to these guidelines.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	A secondary endpoint for the VISTA-16 study was to determine whether varespladib plus a dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin) is superior to placebo plus Lipitor (atorvastatin) as measured in the time to the first occurrence of the combined endpoint of all cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or documented UA with objective evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	A comparison between treatment groups will also be made for each component of the primary efficacy endpoint.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P75_S2	Additionally, the time to multiple occurrences of any non-fatal component of the composite primary endpoint will also be explored.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P75_S3	The biomarkers CRP, IL-6, LDL-C and sPLA 2 will also be evaluated at each time point of the clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	After a minimum of 1,000 patients were enrolled in the VISTA-16 study, an independent statistician not involved with the conduct of the VISTA-16 study conducted a biomarker analysis to ensure patient levels of inflammation, as measured by sPLA 2 , CRP and IL-6, and lipid levels, as measured by LDL-C, had met pre-specified reductions versus placebo at various time-points.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	These markers of inflammation and lipid levels are established in the clinical community and pharmaceutical industry as independent predictors of cardiovascular risk.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	The intention of this biomarker analysis was to ensure results observed in the VISTA-16 were consistent with findings from the FRANCIS Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P76_S3	At the end of this analysis, the independent statistician recommended continuation of the VISTA-16 study based on a pre-specified algorithm.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Since the beginning of the VISTA-16 clinical study, the DSMB has met six (6) times to review all available patient safety and outcome data.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	On March 9, 2012, the DSMB recommended stopping the VISTA-16 study due to a lack efficacy that could not be reasonably overcome in the remainder of the trial.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	After review of the totality of evidence, including the emerging unblinded data from VISTA-16, the DSMB was unanimous in its view that there was cogent evidence to recommend early termination of the trial.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	prespecified primary and secondary endpoints even if the trial continues to its scheduled termination.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	The Company believes that the DSMB's decision was based on the belief that the risk profile of the drug would not outweigh any benefit.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	As a result, the Company has closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	While data continues to be made available to us, and while we continue to assess these data, based on the DSMB recommendation we expect that we will not engage in any further development activities of our sPLA 2 portfolio.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	In July 2008, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical study that enrolled 625 acute coronary syndrome patients across 35 centers in three countries.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	Given the drug's combined anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and lipid-modulating effects, we evaluated the effects of varespladib in acute coronary syndrome patients with high levels of inflammation and dyslipidemia.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	The clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of varespladib when co-administered with the highest dose (80 mg) of Lipitor (atorvastatin).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P81_S3	The clinical study randomized all patients to a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with either 500 mg once-daily of varespladib or placebo in combination with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) and physician-directed standard of care.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had a diagnosis of UA, NSTEMI or STEMI.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	In addition, they must have had one of the following risk factors: diabetes, body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2, CRP 2 mg/L (NSTEMI/STEMI) or CRP 3 mg/L (UA) and presence of three (pre-defined) characteristics of metabolic syndrome.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	Subjects must have been randomized within 96 hours of hospital admission for the index event, or, if already hospitalized, within 96 hours of index event diagnosis.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P82_S3	Any percutaneous revascularization was required to occur prior to randomization.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P82_S4	In addition, because we wanted to assess the effects of varespladib with the highest available dose of Lipitor (atorvastatin), patients were not allowed to use any other lipid-lowering therapies during the clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P82_S5	Follow-up visits for evaluation occurred post-randomization at weeks two, four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24 and then monthly thereafter until clinical study completion.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P82_S6	All enrolled subjects remained on treatment until all subjects had been treated for a minimum of 24 weeks or until the occurrence of MACE.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Patients randomized into the FRANCIS study had baseline characteristics such as LDL-C indexed-event risk factors and demographics similar to other studies of this type.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	All patients who completed the clinical study received a final evaluation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	The primary efficacy endpoint evaluated the change in LDL-C after 500 patients completed eight weeks of treatment.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	LDL-C is the most widely recognized surrogate for predicting cardiovascular risk where percentage reductions in LDL-C have been highly correlated with reductions in future cardiovascular risk.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	changes in established markers of inflammation such as sPLA 2 , CRP and IL-6; and the occurrence of secondary MACE (for purposes of this clinical study, all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, documented UA requiring urgent hospitalization, revascularization occurring 60 days post the index event or non-fatal stroke).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	Results of the primary endpoint demonstrated a statistically significant incremental LDL-C reduction of 5.7% (p = 0.0023) in varespladib treated patients versus those treated with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) alone after eight weeks of therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	A p-value is a probability with a value ranging from 0 to 1, which indicates the likelihood that a clinical study is different between treatment and control groups.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P87_S2	P-values below 0.05 are typically referred to as statistically significant.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	observed in LDL-C reduction from baseline as early as two weeks after treatment.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	The treatment effect was maintained throughout the observation period.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	Secondary endpoints measured effects of varespladib on sPLA 2 , CRP and IL-6 levels, which are well-established markers of inflammation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	While the FRANCIS study was not designed to demonstrate statistically significant changes in CRP and IL-6, the results were consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated improvement across these biomarkers and achieved statistical significance at some time points.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	sPLA 2 concentrations were statistically significantly reduced from the earliest time point of two weeks through the 16-week time point (p 0.0001) as compared to high-dose statin atorvastatin (80mg) therapy alone.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	While our first sPLA 2 measurement in this clinical study occurred at two weeks, data from previous clinical studies utilizing varespladib or varespladib sodium demonstrated reductions in sPLA 2 as early as two days following treatment.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P90_S2	At the end of the study sPLA 2 levels were reduced by 6.4% in the atorvastatin only arm and by 78.5% in the varespladib plus atorvastatin arm (p 0.0001).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P90_S3	At the 16-week time-point in the FRANCIS clinical study sPLA2 levels were reduced by 12.1% in the atorvastatin only arm and by 62.0% in the varespladib plus atorvastatin arm (p 0.0001).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	In addition, treatment-related reductions in CRP and IL-6 levels were also greater in varespladib treated patients compared to those treated with placebo at all time points in the clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P91_S1	The percent decrease in CRP at week two was nearly two-fold greater among varespladib and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) treated patients than those treated with placebo and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) alone (-39% versus -20%, p = 0.183), and at week 16, the difference between treatment groups was statistically significant (-82% versus -73%, p = 0.0067).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P91_S2	At weeks two, four, eight and 16, varespladib treated patients had numerically reduced levels of CRP versus patients treated with placebo.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	The percent decrease in IL-6 in patients on varespladib at week two was more than three times the reduction in IL-6 in patients on placebo (-18% versus -5.1%, p = 0.18).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	Treatment with varespladib resulted in more subjects with LDL-C levels lower than 70 mg/dL and lower than 50 mg/dL than those on placebo (80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) and physician-directed standard of care) alone at eight, 16 and 24 weeks of treatment.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	As discussed above, the NCEP ATP III guidelines have established an LDL-C of 70 mg/dL as an optional target for very high-risk patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	As indicated in the table below, the data suggests varespladib treatment helps patients achieve their LDL-C target levels more quickly and maintain them longer than with high-dose statin (80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin)) therapy alone.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	Finally, given the importance of reducing inflammation as well as LDL-C following an acute coronary syndrome event, we examined the proportion of patients in the clinical study that were able to achieve both LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL and CRP levels below 1 mg/L.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	Significantly more patients at week four and week 16 (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01) reached this combined target when treated with varespladib and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) than with placebo and 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) alone.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	(The actual proportion of subjects in the varespladib group was 25% and 16% in the placebo group).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P95_S3	Additionally, in the PROVE-IT study a comparable proportion (16%) of patients treated with 80 mg Lipitor (atorvastatin) achieved these goals.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	We also conducted an exploratory analysis of MACE in the clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	At 16 weeks, there were 14 (4.2%) MACE in the varespladib treated group as compared to 19 (6.1%) in the placebo group.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P96_S2	At the completion of the clinical study, all patients had received at least six months of therapy and there were 23 (7.4%) MACE in the varespladib treated group as compared to 24 (7.7%) MACE in the placebo group.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P96_S3	While the MACE analysis was not designed to demonstrate any statistical differences between the two treatment groups, we believed these results to be encouraging and provide guidance on the appropriate design of the VISTA-16 study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	Overall, varespladib was generally well-tolerated in this clinical study and no imbalance was seen in dropouts due to drug effects.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	After completing patient treatment, overall exposure to varespladib was a mean of 30 weeks and median of 34 weeks.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P97_S2	In total, 485 total patients completed six months of treatment, with 167 subjects completing 40 weeks and 70 completing 44 weeks.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P97_S3	There was no imbalance of overall adverse events between the treatment arms.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P97_S4	During the clinical study, at week four and week eight, occasional mild and transient elevations in liver enzymes, defined as elevations three times the upper limit of normal, were seen among more patients taking varespladib, but the frequency and magnitude of the elevations were not meaningfully different between the active and control groups at the end of the clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P97_S5	The frequency of the elevations was also similar to that reported for Lipitor (atorvastatin) and other currently approved lipid-lowering agents.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P97_S6	Furthermore, there were no effects on blood pressure or the QT interval, an electro-cardiographic safety endpoint.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	Summary data from FRANCIS was presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in 2010 and the detailed results from the study were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in September 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our Phase 2 PLASMA study was designed to confirm the safety and effect of varespladib on sPLA 2 concentration, other inflammatory biomarkers and lipids in patients with stable CAD.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	In October 2007, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating four doses of varespladib administered twice-daily versus placebo among 396 patients with stable CAD from 38 centers in two countries.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	The clinical study enrolled patients more than 12 weeks after a myocardial infarction or six weeks after an episode of UA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P100_S2	The varespladib doses tested were 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg administered twice per day.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P100_S3	Following randomization, patients were treated for eight weeks and safety and efficacy evaluations were conducted at weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P100_S4	Physician-directed standard of care therapies were permitted during the clinical study, including 259 patients who were on background statin therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	The primary endpoint of the clinical study was the change in sPLA 2 concentration from baseline to week eight in varespladib, across all doses, versus placebo patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	Secondary endpoints in the clinical study included the change in lipids, including LDL-C, lipoprotein subclasses and certain inflammatory biomarkers, from baseline to each of weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	Our Phase 2 PLASMA results were selected for a late-breaking presentation at the American Cardiology Conference and published in the Lancet journal in February 2009.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P102_S1	Results from the clinical study demonstrated that treatment with varespladib led to statistically significant reductions in sPLA 2 , LDL-C and various plaque-building and pro-inflammatory forms of LDL-C. In patients receiving varespladib, there were incremental reductions in CRP versus placebo (-55.6% versus -24.8%, p = 0.47) from baseline to eight weeks.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	Among all patients treated with varespladib, median sPLA 2 concentration decreased by 86.7% from baseline to week eight, as compared to 4.8% in the placebo group (p 0.0001).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P103_S1	Median sPLA 2 concentration decreased among the varespladib groups in a dose-dependent manner.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	At week eight, across all dosage groups, LDL-C was reduced by 9.7% versus placebo (p = 0.0035).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P104_S1	In a subgroup of patients taking statins with LDL-C 70 mg/dL, LDL-C was reduced by 12.0% (p = 0.0065) versus placebo at the eight week time point.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P104_S2	Notably, the reductions in LDL-C appear to be driven primarily by a shift in the distribution of LDL-C particles with fewer pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory small LDL-C particles present in the circulation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P104_S3	In addition, statistically significant reductions from baseline to week eight were seen in total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in the overall clinical study population treated with varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P105_S0	Varespladib was generally well-tolerated among all patients treated.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P105_S1	In general, adverse effects were mild or moderate with no imbalance of adverse events in the varespladib groups as compared to placebo.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P105_S2	The most common adverse effects seen in the varespladib groups were headache (6.4%) and nausea (5.4%).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P105_S3	There were mild and transient elevations of liver function tests, defined as elevations three times the upper limit of normal, in patients taking varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	Based on data from our first PLASMA study, we initiated a second Phase 2 clinical study (PLASMA-2) to evaluate the effect of once-daily varespladib treatment on inflammatory and lipid biomarkers.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	In December 2007, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study evaluating two doses of varespladib versus placebo amongst 138 patients with stable CAD.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P107_S1	The clinical study, conducted in the United States, involved 13 clinical sites.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P107_S2	Following randomization to one of two doses of varespladib or placebo, patients were treated for eight weeks with safety and efficacy evaluations at weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P107_S3	Physician-directed standard of care therapies were permitted during the clinical study, including 123 patients (89.1%) who were on background statin therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	The primary endpoint of the clinical study was a comparison between once-daily doses of varespladib and placebo in changes in sPLA 2 concentration at week eight.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P108_S1	Secondary endpoints in the clinical study included measurements of lipids including LDL-C and certain other inflammatory biomarkers from baseline to each of weeks two, four and eight.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	Results of the primary endpoint, sPLA 2 , were statistically significant and consistent with those generated from the first PLASMA study described above.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P109_S1	Patients on varespladib demonstrated a 77.8% reduction in sPLA 2 concentration as compared to an increase of 8.3% in placebo treated patients (p 0.0001).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P109_S2	Pharmacokinetic data indicated that once-daily dosing with varespladib would be sufficient to achieve over 90% inhibition of sPLA 2 mass and activity over a 24-hour period.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	The anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and lipid-modulating effects of varespladib treatment were consistent with those seen in the first PLASMA study: LDL-C was decreased by 8.3% compared to 0.7% in placebo (p = 0.014).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P110_S1	Due to the small size of this clinical study and the low baseline inflammation present in these patients, no meaningful changes with CRP could be detected between the active and control groups.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	As was observed in the first clinical study, there were statistically significant reductions from baseline to week eight in total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in the overall clinical study population treated with varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	The adverse effect profile for varespladib was consistent with earlier studies and there was no imbalance of adverse events among the varespladib groups and placebo.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	The most common effects seen in the varespladib groups were diarrhea (6.7%), nausea (5.6%), any increase in alanine aminotransferase (5.6%), which is an enzyme that indicates liver cell injury, and any increase in aspartate aminotransferase (5.6%), which is another enzyme that indicates liver cell injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	However, mild and transient elevations of these liver enzymes, defined as elevations three times the upper limit of normal, were infrequent in patients taking varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	Investigator-Sponsored Phase 2 Percutaneous Intervention Study SPIDER-PCI (sPLA 2 ) Inhibition to Decrease Enzyme Release After PCI): Varespladib Once-Daily Versus Placebo for up to 10 Days.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P114_S0	In May 2007, Dr. Vladimir Dzavik at University Health Network Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada initiated an investigator sponsored study with varespladib in patients undergoing a percutaneous intervention, or PCI.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P114_S1	The primary endpoint of this study was to determine if inhibition of sPLA 2 with varespladib will result in a decrease in peri-PCI myocardial necrosis, or heart muscle damage, as measured by elevations of myocardial enzyme markers creatine kinase-MB, or CK-MB, or troponin I.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P114_S2	The study was to enroll a maximum of 164 patients who were scheduled to undergo PCI.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	Elevated levels of troponin I following PCI are associated with an increase in in-hospital complications and, in one study, were an independent predictor of major cardiac events.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P115_S1	After PCI, circulating levels of sPLA 2 increase and patients with higher levels have an increased risk of events after a two-year follow-up.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P115_S2	This study explores the notion that sPLA 2 inhibition may reduce myocardial damage after PCI and improve patient outcomes.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P116_S0	As of August 2009, enrollment and dosing in the SPIDER-PCI investigator study were completed with 144 patients evaluated for purposes of assessing the primary endpoint.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P116_S1	On December 11, 2009, we received a statistical analysis of the patient evaluations, which showed that the primary endpoint of the study, a reduction in the elevation of CK-MB or troponin I above the upper limit of normal at six to eight hours or 18 to 24 hours, was not met (varespladib patients 57% versus placebo patients 51%, p = 0.55).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P116_S2	However, the results showed statistically significant reductions of sPLA 2 as early as 18 hours post-PCI procedure, which persisted throughout the five days of dosing (-93.0%, p 0.001).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P116_S3	Consistent with results from other clinical studies with varespladib, there were numerical reductions in CRP from baseline versus placebo at three to five days (-82.1%, p = 0.23).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P117_S0	Previous Experience at Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P118_S0	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. previously conducted a series of clinical studies evaluating varespladib and varespladib sodium in various inflammatory conditions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P118_S1	In total, at least 17 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies evaluated varespladib and varespladib sodium as a treatment in sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P118_S2	Results from these studies provide a large body of safety data for varespladib and varespladib sodium with more than 1,000 healthy volunteers and subjects receiving treatment.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P119_S0	Throughout these studies, varespladib was generally well-tolerated.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P120_S0	Approximately 150 preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies have been completed with varespladib and varespladib sodium, including two-year rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies, one-year primate study and three-month rat study in combination with Lipitor (atorvastatin).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P121_S0	Blisibimod is a peptibody antagonist of the BAFF cytokine that is initially being developed as a treatment for lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P122_S0	BLyS, also known as B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of B-cells.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P122_S1	It is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P123_S0	The BAFF-R receptor is expressed primarily on peripheral B-cells.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P124_S0	Two randomized, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical studies for blisibimod in 104 lupus patients have already been completed.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P124_S1	Results from these studies demonstrated blisibimod generated anti-BAFF activity and showed statistically significant reductions in B-cells of 50-70% (p 0.001) in lupus patients across multiple subcutaneous and intravenous formulations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P125_S0	In 2009, after successfully reactivating our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study with blisibimod for the treatment of lupus in July 2010 called PEARL-SC.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P125_S1	Enrollment in this study is now complete (N=547) and we anticipate completing the study in 2012.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P125_S2	We may also study blisibimod in other B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as vasculitis, Sj gren's Syndrome or orphan indications such as myasthenia gravis and pemphigus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P126_S0	We continue to actively pursue a partnership with major pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P127_S0	We intend to advance the development of our BAFF targeting molecule, blisibimod, a selective peptibody, to exploit its broad clinical utility in autoimmune diseases.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P127_S1	Blisibimod, as a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture versus antibodies that are produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P127_S2	In addition, blisibimod offers a number of potential differentiations over other anti-BAFF compounds, as well as other novel B-cell directed therapies, including:
1316175_12_ITEM1_P128_S0	convenient, at-home, patient-administered subcutaneous dosing with a range of dosing frequencies including monthly and weekly; ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF, which may confer differentiating pharmacodynamic characteristics; non-glycosylated peptibody that is produced in a bacterial fermentation manufacturing process, which may reduce the potential to be immunogenic and may provide manufacturing benefits and lower cost of goods; and multiple binding domains achieve highest reported affinity for inhibition of BAFF.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P129_S0	Lupus is an autoimmune disorder that involves inflammation that causes swelling, pain and tissue damage throughout the body.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P129_S1	Lupus can affect any part of the body, but especially the skin, heart, brain, lungs, joints and the kidneys.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P129_S2	The course of the disease is unpredictable, with periods of illness, called flares alternating with remission.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P130_S0	The Lupus Foundation estimates that approximately 1.5 million people in the United States and five million worldwide suffer from lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P130_S1	Although lupus may affect people of either sex, women are 10 times more likely to suffer from the disease than men, according to the Lupus Foundation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P131_S0	Patients with active lupus may have a broad range of symptoms related to the inflammation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P131_S1	Inflammation of the brain may cause seizures and other neurologic abnormalities.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P131_S2	Inflammation of the heart may cause heart failure or sudden death.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P131_S3	Lung inflammation causes shortness of breath.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P131_S4	Lupus may also cause swollen joints and severe rash.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P131_S5	In addition, LN may lead to requiring kidney dialysis or transplantation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P132_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production are known to be central to the process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P132_S1	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF plays an important role in this disease process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P132_S2	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P132_S3	In addition, treatment of these same mice with BAFF antagonists appears to ameliorate the disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P133_S0	Based on positive results among 104 patients in our Phase 1a and 1b clinical studies, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus patients called PEARL-SC.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P133_S1	Enrollment in PEARL-SC is now complete.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P134_S0	PEARL-SC is a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b study which enrolled 547 patients in 11 countries at 72 clinical sites.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P134_S1	Subjects were randomized into three active subcutaneous treatment arms and one placebo treatment arm for a minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P135_S0	The primary endpoint of the PEARL-SC study is clinical improvement at 24 weeks in a SLE responder index a composite responder index evaluating various patient and physician reported clinical disease activity including a SELENA/SLEDAI improvement of five (5) points or greater, no increase in a physician's global assessment of more than 0.3 points, with no new BILAG A or two new BILAG B organ domain flares.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P135_S1	Secondary endpoints will include safety, improvement in other clinical assessment scores, clinical response in patients with various baseline disease severities, resolution of fatigue, steroid utilization and time to flare.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P136_S0	In November 2011, we completed an interim biomarker analysis of changes in B-Cells in patients enrolled in the PEARL-SC clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P136_S1	After analysis by an independent statistician, data from the ongoing PEARL-SC study indicated that weekly and monthly subcutaneous doses of blisibimod resulted in statistically significant reductions of B-cells.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P136_S2	Elevations in these B-cells have been associated with an increased risk of disease activity in lupus patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P136_S3	These findings are consistent with data from previous clinical studies of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P137_S0	Upon completion of PEARL-SC, patients may be invited to enroll in an open-label extension study in which patients will receive active study drug (blisibimod) for the primary objective of monitoring long-term safety.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P137_S1	The open-label extension study is already underway and enrolling patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P138_S0	In December 2011, we completed the technology transfer from Amgen and manufacturing scale up to 3,000 liters at our contract manufacturing organization, or CRO (Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices or "Fujifilm").
1316175_12_ITEM1_P138_S1	Two (2) batches of blisibimod produced under US FDA good manufacturing procedures, or GMP, at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P138_S2	Data from our first 3,000 liter manufacturing campaign was submitted to the US FDA, and after having received no comments from the US FDA, product from this batch was released for use in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P138_S3	With the completion of the last batch of blisibimod in 2011, we believe we now have sufficient clinical material, both placebo and blisibimod, to complete dosing on the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P139_S0	The following chart outlines the basic manufacturing steps required for the production of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P140_S0	In November 2010, we suspended enrollment in the PEARL-SC clinical study after reports of broken vials at clinical sites.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P140_S1	After informing the US FDA and a thorough inspection of all product vials, the study was re-opened for enrollment in January of 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P140_S2	It was determined the vial breakage was due to low temperature shipping conditions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P140_S3	Appropriate changes were incorporated and there have been no further reports of broken vials.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P141_S0	In July 2010, we received clearance from the FDA to begin recruitment of lupus patients into the PEARL-SC clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P141_S1	Subsequent to this clearance, the FDA requested additional information regarding characterization and qualification of the manufactured vials of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P141_S2	In addition, the FDA requested minor changes to aspects of the PEARL-SC study including collection of ECG testing at the end of dosing and a recommendation for a corticosteroid tapering strategy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P141_S3	Neither of these changes are considered material to the conduct of the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P141_S4	The FDA also recommended we submit to the IND various analytical and comparability data from our recently completed manufacturing lot of blisibimod and a comparability proposal for purposes of soliciting their input prior to implementation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P141_S5	We submitted a response to the FDA in October 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P142_S0	SLE response index and to include an option for an interim efficacy analysis.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P143_S0	Enrollment in the PEARL-SC study is completed.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P144_S0	Prior to our in-licensing of blisibimod, Amgen completed two Phase 1 clinical studies of blisibimod in lupus patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of the drug using intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P144_S1	Prior to conducting Phase 1 clinical studies in lupus patients, Amgen conducted a pre-Phase 1 clinical study in lupus patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P144_S2	In Amgen's pre-Phase 1 clinical study, individual B-cell subsets, such as mature na ve B-cells, activated B-cells and memory B-cells, all therapeutic targets for blisibimod, were quantified in order to characterize the specific B-cell subset abnormalities associated with lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P145_S0	The randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1a clinical study evaluated blisibimod as a single intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 56 lupus patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P145_S1	Intravenous doses included 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P146_S0	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P146_S1	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P146_S2	Results from this clinical study indicated the safety and tolerability of blisibimod administered as single dose of intravenous or subcutaneous was comparable to placebo.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P146_S3	Single doses of blisibimod exhibited linear pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P146_S4	There were comparable adverse events between the blisibimod and placebo groups with no deaths reported.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P146_S5	In addition, no neutralization antibodies were seen across all doses.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P147_S0	The most common adverse events were nausea (15%), headache (10%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%) and diarrhea (8%).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P148_S0	Blisibimod was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study as an intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 63 lupus patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P149_S0	subcutaneous doses included 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P149_S1	Patients received their doses of blisibimod or placebo once-weekly for four weeks.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P149_S2	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P149_S3	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod after multiple doses.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P149_S4	Results showed that multiple doses of blisibimod exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P149_S5	Further, results demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in total B-cells as early as 15 days of treatment, and total B-cell reduction (up to approximately 60-70% of baseline) reached its nadir after about 160 days of therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P149_S6	By six months after treatment, the B-cell populations had returned to baseline levels.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P150_S0	An experimental analysis was also conducted to assess B-cell subsets in patients following multiple doses.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P150_S1	Results demonstrated that blisibimod selectively modulates certain B-cell subsets and induced trends toward normalizing the B-cell abnormalities that were observed in lupus patients in the pre-Phase 1 clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P151_S0	Results indicated that the tolerability of blisibimod administered as multiple doses of intravenous or subcutaneous administration was generally comparable to placebo.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P151_S1	There were no deaths reported between the blisibimod and placebo groups.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P152_S0	Few neutralization antibodies were seen, and all resolved in subsequent visits.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P152_S1	Based on these results and published data from competitor studies, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating blisibimod in lupus patients during the second half of 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P153_S0	Varespladib sodium is an intravenously administered, potent, broad-spectrum inhibitor of sPLA 2 , including forms IIa, V and X. Varespladib is being evaluated for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease in at-risk patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P153_S1	Substantial scientific evidence implicates sPLA 2 activity in the development of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as other forms of acute lung injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P154_S0	The FDA granted orphan drug and fast-track designation for varespladib sodium for the prevention of acute chest syndrome in at-risk patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P154_S1	We currently retain all worldwide product rights, except in Japan where Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P154_S2	We also licensed varespladib sodium from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. in July 2006.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P155_S0	sPLA 2 levels increase in advance of acute chest syndrome episodes and can be used alongside the presence of fever to strongly predict an impending episode.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P155_S1	There is a strong correlation between levels of CRP and sPLA 2 in this patient population.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P155_S2	Patients with acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease can exhibit levels of sPLA 2 that can be 100 times greater than normal.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P156_S0	Sickle cell disease is a lifelong genetic, blood disorder typically diagnosed during early childhood.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P156_S1	According to the Sickle Cell Information Center, in the United States, over 70,000 people currently suffer from the disease and approximately 1,000 children are born with the disease annually.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P156_S2	According to Medtech Insight, in Europe, there are over 200,000 people suffering from the disease, and the numbers increase dramatically in Africa, where, according to the WHO, 200,000 children alone are born with sickle cell disease each year.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P156_S3	Life expectancy for these patients is significantly shortened, with most expected to live only until their mid-40s.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P157_S0	The disease is characterized by structurally altered red blood cells that assume an abnormal shape, similar to a sickle, and produce an altered form of hemoglobin.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P157_S1	These altered red blood cells have a shortened life-cycle, become stiff and have difficulty passing through the body's small blood vessels.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P157_S2	At times, these abnormal cells may obstruct or block blood flow through small blood vessels, leading to significant damage in tissue and bone.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P157_S3	This damage is more commonly labeled as VOC.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P157_S4	During VOC, blockage occurs within the circulation of the long bones, causing microscopic bone damage.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P157_S5	Fragments of bone or bone fat may break free and embolize to the lungs, causing lung injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P158_S0	VOC is a common trigger for the more serious complication of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P159_S0	Acute chest syndrome exhibits symptoms and characteristics similar to acute lung injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P160_S0	There are an estimated 10,000 episodes of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease per year in the United States.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P160_S1	It represents the most common cause of death in sickle cell patients and the second most common cause of hospitalization among such patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P160_S2	A majority of sickle cell patients will experience at least one episode of acute chest syndrome and repeated episodes can result in progressive lung disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P161_S0	The disorder is most common in the two- to four- year age group and gradually declines in incidence with age.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P162_S0	There are no marketed therapies targeting acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P163_S0	The most common treatment regimen includes heavy doses of corticosteroids, opiates, transfusion and antibiotics while the patient suffers through the attack.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P163_S1	In addition, hydroxyurea, a chemotherapy, was found to reduce the frequency of VOC and the need for blood transfusions in adult patients with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P163_S2	However, all of these therapeutics are associated with significant adverse effects while only offering limited patient benefit.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P164_S0	In January 2012, we initiated a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical study that will enroll up to 150 patients with sickle cell disease who are at an elevated risk of developing acute chest syndrome as a result of fever, VOC and CRP 5.0 mg/L at the time of hospitalization.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P164_S1	Patients will be randomized to receive a continuous infusion of varespladib sodium or placebo for 48 hours after randomization.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P165_S0	The primary endpoint of this study will be freedom from acute chest syndrome as determined by physician assessment and independent review of chest X-rays.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P165_S1	This study represents a unique treatment approach for a small, orphan indication.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P165_S2	As a result the appropriateness of the design and endpoints of this study for purposes of registration will only be known at the conclusion of the study and upon submission to the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P166_S0	On March 9, 2012, an independent data safety monitoring board recommended stopping the Company's VISTA-16 clinical study for varespladib due to a lack efficacy that could not be reasonably overcome in the remainder of the trial.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P166_S1	As a result, the Company has closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy immediately.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P166_S2	The Company believes that the DSMB's decision was based on the belief that the risk profile of the drug would not outweigh any benefit.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P166_S3	The Company has also closed enrollment in its IMPACTS-2 clinical study for varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P167_S0	While data continues to be made available to us, and while we continue to assess these data, based on the DSMB recommendation to stop the VISTA-16 study for varespladib, we expect that we will not engage in any further development activities of our sPLA 2 portfolio.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P168_S0	Phase 2 Acute Chest Syndrome in Hospitalized Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Study Investigation of the Modulation of Phospholipase in Acute Chest Syndrome, or IMPACTS.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P169_S0	In January 2007, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of varespladib sodium when administered as a 48-hour continuous infusion.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P170_S0	30 sites in the United States.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P170_S1	This clinical study enrolls hospitalized sickle cell disease patients at risk for acute chest syndrome on the basis of VOC, fever and serum sPLA 2 concentration level greater than 50 mg/mL.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P170_S2	The primary endpoint for the clinical study was designed to assess safety and tolerability.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P170_S3	Secondary endpoints included the absence of acute chest syndrome, suppression of sPLA 2 , reduced need for blood transfusions and assessment of pharmacokinetics.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S0	The first group of patients was randomized 2:1 to receive low dose varespladib sodium or placebo as a 48-hour continuous infusion.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S1	A pre-specified interim analysis was conducted in February 2009 after the 30th patient completed treatment to examine safety and adjust dosing schedules.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S2	The interim data was balanced between two dosing arms of 30 55 g/kg/hr (n = 11) and 55 g/kg/hr (n = 6).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S3	Interim results indicated serum levels of varespladib sodium when dosed at 55 ig/kg/hr reduced sPLA 2 activity levels by more than 80% from baseline within 48 hours.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S4	Furthermore, the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease appeared to be related to the level of sPLA 2 activity.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S5	The DSMB recommended the clinical study continue based on safety and tolerability.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S6	In addition, given the safety profile, the DSMB approved the addition of a higher dose group of 110 g/kg/hr via continuous infusion during the second half of the clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P171_S7	We believe that the data suggests varespladib sodium can suppress sPLA 2 at levels that may prevent the complication of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P172_S0	Reductions of sPLA 2 activity from baseline and incidence of acute chest syndrome (including placebo patients and patients receiving varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P172_S1	Exploratory analysis to determine correlation between degree of sPLA 2 suppression and incidence of acute chest syndrome.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P173_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including autoimmune diseases.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P173_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P174_S0	We are advancing the development of blisibimod to exploit the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P174_S1	We have completed enrollment in the Phase 2b clinical study known as PEARL-SC in lupus patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P174_S2	We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of this compound in lupus or in other B-cell mediated diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or Sj gren's Syndrome, that may benefit from BAFF antagonism, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P175_S0	Developing Commercial Strategies Designed to Maximize Our Product Candidates' Market Potential.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P176_S0	Our primary product candidate is focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as rheumatologists.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P176_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications such as acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P176_S2	In other chronic indications such as CAD, we intend to seek commercial collaborations with companies that have a large, dedicated sales force focused on general practitioners and cardiologists and we plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P177_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P177_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P177_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P178_S0	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P178_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P178_S2	Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P178_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P178_S4	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P179_S0	Statins Treatment with varespladib is designed to offer anti-inflammatory benefits for acute coronary syndrome patients that are additive to treatment with statins.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P179_S1	However, statin therapy is thought to confer some element of anti-inflammatory benefit as monotherapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P179_S2	In certain circumstances, it is possible the anti-inflammatory benefits of statin monotherapy with products such as Lipitor (atorvastatin), which is marketed by Pfizer Inc., Crestor (rosuvastatin), which is marketed by AstraZeneca UK Limited and Zocor (simvastatin), which is marketed by Merck Co., Inc. may be viewed as competitive to that offered by varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P180_S0	Other Lipid-Lowering Therapies Increasingly, additional lipid-lowering agents are being administered either in combination with statins or as monotherapy to help acute coronary syndrome patients reduce levels of LDL-C. Varespladib has demonstrated LDL-C lowering benefits when tested as monotherapy and in combination with statin therapy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P180_S1	To the extent acute coronary syndrome patients need additional LDL-C lowering, varespladib may compete for use with other approved agents such as Vytorin, which is a fixed dose combination therapy combining ezetimibe and Zocor, Tricor (fenofibrate tablets) and Niaspan (niacin), both of which are marketed by Abbott Laboratories, Zetia (ezetimibe) and fish oils (omega-3).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P181_S0	Human Genome Sciences, Inc.'s and partner GlaxoSmithKline plc's Benlysta (belimumab) was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P181_S1	It is the first novel therapy approved in the last fifty years.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P182_S0	Current therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants generally act to hold back broadly the proliferation of many types of cells, including white blood cells.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P182_S1	However, use of these agents is associated with significant adverse events and broad immune suppression.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P183_S0	Several new biological agents under development have targeted BAFF (or BLyS) and other B-cell related pathways for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P183_S1	These product candidates include Benlysta (belimumab) from Human Genome Sciences, Inc., LY2127399 from Eli Lilly and Company, atacicept, or TACI-Ig, from ZymoGenetics Inc. and epratuzumab from Immunomedics, Inc., as well as others acting via non B-cell mechanisms, such as Lupuzor from Cephalon.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P184_S0	intravenous delivery; selective modulation and reduction of relevant B-cell types in lupus patients; the ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF; its smaller size as compared to a full antibody, which may confer differentiating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics; and distinct patent protection based on a novel and proprietary technology developed and commercialized by Amgen, which may also confer potential manufacturing advantages with lower cost of goods based on a bacterial fermentation manufacturing process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P185_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P185_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P186_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_12_ITEM1_P187_S0	obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; defend our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

1316175_12_ITEM1_P210_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P210_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P210_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P210_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P211_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P211_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P212_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P212_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P212_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P213_S0	We are aware of two families of third party United States patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P213_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P213_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent's claims.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P213_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P213_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P213_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P214_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of varespladib, blisibimod, varespladib sodium, A-003 or one or more new sPLA 2 compounds, one or more of the U.S. patents listed above may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P215_S0	A-101 is novel compound developed to treat cardiovascular disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P216_S0	As of the date of this report, our internally developed A-101 patent portfolio includes:
1316175_12_ITEM1_P217_S0	One pending U.S. non-provisional patent application.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P218_S0	We own, and therefore hold all worldwide rights in and to, the patent application, which contains claims directed to A-101 compositions of matter and methods of treating various cardiovascular indications.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P219_S0	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P220_S0	In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd., pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license in all countries except for Japan to certain technology and compounds relating to sPLA 2 inhibitors.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P220_S1	The licensed technology was largely developed under a research and development agreement between Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd., which was entered into between the parties in August 1992 and terminated in December 2004.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P221_S0	Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive rights to (i) use licensed patent rights and know-how to identify and develop sPLA 2 inhibitors, (ii) develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell licensed compounds and pharmaceutical formulations thereof, including varespladib, varespladib sodium, A-003 and other sPLA 2 inhibitors and (iii) grant sublicenses.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P221_S1	The licensed patent rights include a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P221_S2	Although the agreement does not allow us to sell or offer for sale licensed products in Japan, it does allow us to conduct preclinical and clinical studies in Japan in support of applications for marketing authorization outside of Japan, and to make and have made licensed products in Japan for use or sale outside of Japan.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P221_S3	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. retain the right to use licensed products for research purposes only.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P221_S4	Eli Lilly also retains the right to conduct studies of specific compounds in animals for research purposes, but only with our prior written approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P221_S5	In addition, Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains the non-exclusive right to make and have made licensed products for supply to us, as well as its rights to continue research, development and marketing of licensed technology in Japan.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P222_S0	Upon entering into the license agreement, we assumed control of all prosecution and maintenance of core patents prosecuted and maintained by Eli Lilly prior to the agreement.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P222_S1	All core patents prosecuted and maintained by Shionogi Co., Ltd. prior to the agreement remained under the control of Shionogi Co., Ltd. Licensed patent rights that were not classified as core remained under the control of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P222_S2	However, control of certain of these patents and applications has since been transferred to us following the decision by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd. to discontinue prosecution and maintenance.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S0	Upon entering into the license agreement, we made one-time payments of cash in the amount of $250,000 and issued shares of convertible preferred stock with a total aggregate value of $2.3 million to Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S1	We are required to make various milestone payments and to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage as net sales increase.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S2	Both the milestone and royalty payment schedules vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., oral versus intravenously administered).
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S3	For varespladib, we are required to pay up to $32.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S4	For varespladib sodium, we are required to pay up to $3.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $25.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S5	For other product formulations that we are not currently developing, we would be required to pay up to $2.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $35.5 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S6	Our royalty payments vary based upon type of formulation and annual net sales, but generally range from the mid-single digits to the low double digits.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P223_S7	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular licensed product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the first date on which a generic version of the licensed product reaches a 25% total market share in that country.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P224_S0	The license agreement will remain in effect for the length of our royalty obligation on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate earlier or until termination by mutual agreement.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P224_S1	Upon expiration of the agreement, our license will remain in effect and will convert to an irrevocable, perpetual royalty-free license.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P224_S2	If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement, Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd. can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P225_S0	relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P226_S0	Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing blisibimod, as well as the right to grant sublicenses.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P226_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P226_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P226_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P227_S0	During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P227_S1	Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than blisibimod that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P228_S0	We paid a first installment fee of $3.0 million and a second installment fee of $3.0 million.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P228_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P228_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P228_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P228_S4	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P229_S0	The license agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P229_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P230_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under cGMP with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P230_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P230_S2	Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P231_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P231_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P231_S2	In order to commercialize any of our product candidates, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P231_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize these product candidates alone.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P232_S0	commercialize our product candidates while retaining rights to co-promote our products to a select audience of high prescribing physicians in the United States, thereby supplementing or enhancing the efforts of a commercial partner.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P232_S1	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P233_S0	In North America and Western Europe, patients in the target markets for our product candidates are largely managed by medical specialists in the areas of cardiology and internal medicine.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P234_S0	Historically, companies have experienced substantial commercial success through the deployment of specialized sales forces that can address a majority of key prescribers, particularly within the cardiovascular disease marketplace.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P234_S1	Therefore, we expect to utilize a specialized sales force in North America for the sales and marketing of product candidates that we may successfully develop.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P234_S2	Based upon sales models, we estimate that we could effectively promote (supplementing a commercial partner's sales efforts) the treatment of acute coronary syndrome to 3,000 cardiologists with approximately 300 sales representatives in North America and Western Europe.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P234_S3	Outside of North America, and in situations or markets where a more favorable return may be realized through licensing commercial rights to a third party, we may license a portion or all of our commercial rights in a territory to a third party in exchange for one or more of the following: up-front payments, research funding, development funding, milestone payments and royalties on drug sales.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P235_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidates to market alone or in collaboration with a co-development or co-promotion partner.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P235_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P235_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P236_S0	Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P236_S1	Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process, and our biological product candidate, blisibimod, must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P237_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P237_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P237_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P237_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P238_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_12_ITEM1_P239_S0	completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for its intended use; submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P240_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P241_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P241_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P241_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P241_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P242_S0	Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P242_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P242_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P242_S3	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P243_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P243_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P243_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P243_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P243_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P244_S0	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P244_S1	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P245_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_12_ITEM1_P246_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P247_S0	for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P248_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P248_S1	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P248_S2	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P249_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P249_S1	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P249_S2	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P249_S3	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P250_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P250_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P250_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P251_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P251_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P252_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P252_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P252_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P253_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P253_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P253_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P253_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P254_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P255_S0	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product's continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P256_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P256_S1	The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P256_S2	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P256_S3	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P256_S4	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P257_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P257_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P257_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P257_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P257_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P257_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P257_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P258_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P258_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P258_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product's safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P259_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P259_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P259_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P259_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P259_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P259_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P259_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P260_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S0	within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S6	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P261_S7	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P262_S0	HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P262_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator's safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P262_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P263_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P263_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P263_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P263_S3	The current pediatric exclusivity provision was reauthorized in September 2007.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P264_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P264_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P264_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P264_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P265_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P265_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P265_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P265_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P266_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P266_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P267_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P267_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P268_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P268_S1	Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P269_S0	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P269_S1	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P270_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P270_S1	A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P270_S2	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P270_S3	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P271_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P271_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P271_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P272_S0	We have been granted fast track designation for our product candidate, varespladib sodium, for the prevention of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease in at-risk patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P272_S1	Even though we have received fast track designation for varespladib sodium, the FDA may later decide that varespladib sodium no longer meets the conditions for qualification.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P272_S2	In addition, obtaining fast track designation may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P273_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P274_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P274_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P275_S0	products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P275_S1	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P276_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P276_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P276_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P277_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P277_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P278_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P278_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P279_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P279_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P279_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P280_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P280_S1	For example, in September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the authority to require post-market studies and clinical studies, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, approved by the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P280_S2	In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug or biological product, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the product, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events for varespladib and whether the product is a new molecular entity.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P281_S0	We have submitted a REMS as an appendix to the SPA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P281_S1	If the FDA determines our REMS is necessary, we must submit a REMS plan as part of an NDA or BLA.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P281_S2	The FDA may require that a REMS include various elements, such as a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the product, or other measures.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P282_S0	Failure to comply with any requirements under the new law may result in significant penalties.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P282_S1	The new law also authorizes significant civil money penalties for the dissemination of false or misleading direct-to-consumer advertisements and allows the FDA to require companies to submit direct-to-consumer television drug advertisements for FDA review prior to public dissemination.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P283_S0	are required to submit certain clinical study information for inclusion in the clinical study registry data bank.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P284_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P284_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P285_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P285_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P285_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P285_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P286_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P286_S1	European Union member states require both regulatory clearance by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P287_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P287_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P287_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P288_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P288_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P288_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P288_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state's assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P288_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P289_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P289_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P289_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P289_S3	However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P289_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P289_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P289_S6	Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P290_S0	consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P290_S1	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P291_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P291_S1	For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P291_S2	Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of "average manufacturer price" for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P291_S3	Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P291_S4	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P291_S5	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P291_S6	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P292_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P292_S1	Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P292_S2	Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P292_S3	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P292_S4	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P292_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P292_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P293_S0	It is not clear what effect the MMA will have on the prices paid for currently approved drugs and the pricing options for new drugs approved after January 1, 2006.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P294_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P294_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P294_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P294_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P295_S0	There are also laws that govern a company's eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P295_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company's ability to operate its business.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P296_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P296_S1	We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P297_S0	proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P297_S1	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P297_S2	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P297_S3	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P298_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P299_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P300_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P301_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P301_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P301_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P301_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P301_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P301_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P302_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had 38 employees, eight of whom hold an M.D., Ph.D. or Pharm.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P302_S1	D. All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P302_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P303_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P303_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC, which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P303_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P304_S0	The mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_12_ITEM1_P305_S0	Through a link on the "Investors" section of our website (under "SEC Filings" in the "Financial Information" section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this report.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We are a development stage company with only seven years of operating history.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have focused primarily on developing our three product candidates, varespladib, blisibimod and varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We have financed our operations exclusively through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, and debt financings and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in September 2004.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $201.0 million.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Substantially all of our losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect to incur additional losses over the next several years, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate revenues.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect our development expenses, as well as our clinical product manufacturing expenses, to increase in connection with our Phase 2b clinical study named PEARL-SC for blisibimod and other clinical studies related to the development of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, we will incur additional costs of operating as a public company and, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We have never generated any revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct preclinical tests in animals and clinical studies in human beings, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We have not generated any revenue from our development-stage product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	if regulatory approvals are obtained, begin the commercial manufacturing of our product candidates with our third-party manufacturers; launch commercial sales and effectively market our product candidates, either independently or in strategic collaborations with third parties; and achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	All of our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Currently, we have three product candidates in clinical development: varespladib, blisibimod and varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These product candidates could fail in clinical studies if we are unable to demonstrate that they are effective or if they cause unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Failure of our product candidates in clinical studies would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Additionally, all of our other product candidates are in preclinical development.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our drug discovery efforts may not produce any other viable or marketable product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Even if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, the approved product candidate may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Physicians, patients, payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend any of our products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Even if we are able to generate product sales, which we cannot guarantee, we may not achieve profitability soon thereafter, if ever.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If we are unable to generate product revenues, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without additional funding.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our future capital requirements could be substantial and will depend on many factors including:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	revenues received from approved products, if any, in the future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As of the date of this report, we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	terminate, reduce or delay preclinical studies, clinical studies or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates; or terminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for sale.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to each of Eli Lilly and Company, Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Amgen Inc. is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, and Shionogi Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialize certain secretory phospholipase A2, or sPLA2, inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and other diseases.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Pursuant to our license agreement with them, we have an obligation to pay to each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. significant milestone and royalty payments based upon how we develop and commercialize certain sPLA2 inhibitors, including varespladib and varespladib sodium, and our achievement of certain significant corporate, clinical and financial events.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	For varespladib, we are required to pay up to $32.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	For varespladib sodium, we are required to pay up to $3.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $25.0 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	For other product formulations that we are not currently developing, we would be required to pay up to $2.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones and up to $35.5 million upon achievement of certain approval and post-approval sales milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, in December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Pursuant to our license agreement with Amgen, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to Eli Lilly, Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Amgen is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of certain sPLA2 inhibitors or blisibimod, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, conducting product development activities for our primary product candidates, varespladib, blisibimod and varespladib sodium, and performing research and development.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our product candidates which are still under clinical development.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot assure you that these product candidates or any of our other product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our lead product candidate is blisibimod, which has completed several Phase 1 clinical studies and has completed enrollment in a Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In July 2010, we received clearance from the FDA to begin recruitment of lupus patients into the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In November 2010, we placed a voluntary hold on the PEARL-SC study due to problems found with vials.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Patient enrollment in the study was temporarily suspended and dosing was discontinued in patients who were enrolled in the study while we conducted an analysis of the problem.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We resolved the issues found with the vials in December 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	After analysis, simulation and consultation with industry experts, we determined that shipping on dry ice was the root cause of the issue.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Shipping logistics were modified and we reinitiated enrollment in PEARL-SC and dosing in January 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We have received no reports of patient-related side effects or problems with drug administration that could be attributed to the vial problem.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	SLE response index and to include an option for an interim efficacy analysis.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable therapeutics; be proven safe and effective in clinical studies; meet applicable regulatory standards; be capable of being produced in sufficient quantities at acceptable costs; be successfully commercialized; or obtain favorable reimbursement.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have not submitted an NDA or BLA or received marketing approval for any of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical study or complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical study; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and study sites; manufacturing, including manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate or other materials for use in clinical studies; obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site; recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical studies for a variety of reasons, including size of patient population, nature of clinical study protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and competition from other clinical study programs for similar indications; severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by patients in a clinical study; and retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For example, while an independent statistician has completed an analysis of various biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and determined that treatment with once-daily varespladib met the pre-specified criteria for the VISTA-16 study to proceed, an independent DSMB reviewing the clinical data from the VISTA-16 study may recommend the clinical study discontinue based on safety and tolerability.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	failure to conduct the clinical study in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols; inspection of the clinical study operations or study sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold; unforeseen safety issues or any determination that a clinical study presents unacceptable health risks; and lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Product development costs to us and our collaborators will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidates or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	For example, we may need to increase our sample size for our VISTA-16 study for varespladib if the overall major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE, rate is lower than expected.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delaying factors outside our control.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, varespladib, blisibimod, varespladib sodium or any other product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidates, including varespladib, blisibimod and varespladib sodium, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidates have performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we breach the license agreements for our primary product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our primary product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are party to an agreement with Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. containing exclusive, worldwide licenses, except for Japan, of the composition of matter, methods of making and methods of use for certain sPLA2 inhibitors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We are also party to an agreement with Amgen containing exclusive, worldwide licenses of the composition of matter and methods of use for blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	These agreements require us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify Eli Lilly, Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Amgen under the terms of the agreements.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors may terminate our exclusive licenses and may be able to re-obtain licensed technology and aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us that relate to the licensed technology that originated from the licensors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of varespladib, blisibimod and varespladib sodium after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreements.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the licenses could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for varespladib, blisibimod or varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The market for inflammatory disease therapeutics is especially large and competitive.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	All of the sPLA2 inhibitor compounds we are currently developing, if approved, will face intense competition, either as monotherapies or in combination therapies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	For lupus, Human Genome Sciences, Inc.'s and GlaxoSmithKline plc's BAFF antagonist monoclonal antibody, Benlysta, was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of lupus.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Further, we are aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of lupus, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Merck Serono S.A., whose dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist fusion protein, Atacicept, is in a Phase 3 clinical study for lupus; and Immunomedics, Inc. and UCB S.A., who recently reported favorable results for their CD-22 antagonist humanized antibody, epratuzumab, which completed a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus and has begun a Phase 3 study, and Eli Lilly's anti-BLYS monoclonal antibody, LY2127399, which has begun two Phase 3 studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Phase 2 clinical studies conducted by us with our product candidates have generated differences in adverse effects and serious adverse events.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The most common adverse effects seen with any of our product candidates versus placebo include diarrhea, headache, nausea and increases in alanine aminotransferase, which is an enzyme that indicates liver cell injury.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The most common serious adverse events seen with any of our product candidates include death, VOC and congestive heart failure.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P49_S4	While none of these serious adverse events were considered related to the administration of our product candidates by the clinical investigators, if serious adverse events that are considered related to our product candidates are observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Further, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product; regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications; we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical studies or change the labeling of the product; we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and our reputation may suffer.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from these product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize any of our product candidates until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate we develop.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and FDA regulatory review.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	For example, the label ultimately approved for varespladib, if any, may include restrictions on use.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Further, the FDA has indicated that long-term safety data on varespladib may need to be obtained as a post-market requirement.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P56_S4	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P56_S5	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P56_S6	If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	issue warning letters or untitled letters; seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; suspend any ongoing clinical studies; refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us; suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	New legal and regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain approvals for our product candidates and could limit or make more burdensome our ability to commercialize any approved products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	For example, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, granted the FDA new authority to impose post-approval clinical study requirements, require safety-related changes to product labeling and require the adoption of risk management plans, referred to in the legislation as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	The REMS may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals, and restrictions on distribution and use.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Pursuant to the FDAAA, if the FDA makes the requisite findings, it might require that a new product be used only by physicians with specified specialized training, only in specified designated health care settings, or only in conjunction with special patient testing and monitoring.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P60_S4	The legislation also included the following: requirements for providing the public information on ongoing clinical studies through a clinical study registry and for disclosing clinical study results to the public through such registry; renewed requirements for conducting clinical studies to generate information on the use of products in pediatric patients; and substantial new penalties, for example, for false or misleading consumer advertisements.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Other proposals have been made to impose additional requirements on drug approvals, further expand post-approval requirements, and restrict sales and promotional activities.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P60_S6	The new legislation, and the additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidates, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval does not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products; the relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians and payors of blisibimod in the treatment of lupus; the prevalence and severity of any adverse effects; limitations or warnings contained in a product's FDA-approved labeling; availability of alternative treatments; pricing and cost-effectiveness; the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators' sales and marketing strategies; our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Paul F. Truex, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Colin Hislop, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer and the other principal members of our executive team.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P66_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Also in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P72_S3	As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third-party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, the Health Care Reform Law and additional prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P75_S4	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P75_S5	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the European Union and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P79_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	impairment of our business reputation; withdrawal of clinical study participants; costs of related litigation; distraction of management's attention from our primary business; substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P83_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P85_S3	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P86_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P88_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P88_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P88_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P88_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P90_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates or market them.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P92_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In December 2011, we completed the technology transfer from Amgen and manufacturing scale up to 3,000 liters at our contract manufacturing organization, or CRO (Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices or "Fujifilm").
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Two (2) batches of blisibimod produced under US FDA good manufacturing procedures, or GMP, at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P93_S2	We submitted plans to the FDA on March 4, 2011 and September 9, 2011 establishing criteria to demonstrate comparability of blisibimod manufactured by Fujifilm to that manufactured by Amgen.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Data confirming comparability to Phase 1 material (Amgen) was filed with the FDA on August 8, 2011 and September 8, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P93_S4	To date, we have had no comments on any of these submissions.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Should the FDA not agree with our comparability assessment or if we are unable to agree on the specifications for future blisibimod manufacturing, further clinical development of blisibimod beyond the PEARL-SC clinical study would be substantially delayed and we would incur substantial additional expense.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P94_S1	There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P94_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P94_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P94_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P94_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P95_S1	If we successfully commercialize any of our drugs, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P95_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P95_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, the satisfaction of which on a timely basis may not be met.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P97_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P97_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P97_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P97_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P99_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P99_S3	For example, organizations like the American Heart Association have made recommendations about therapies in the cardiovascular therapeutics market.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P99_S4	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If our or our licensors' patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidates or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	As of the date of this report, we either own or hold license rights to numerous US, EP, and non-EP foreign patents relating to varespladib sodium/varespladib, other sPLA2 inhibiting compounds, and blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our varespladib sodium/varespladib portfolio includes patents and patent applications originally filed by Anthera and exclusively licensed or assigned cases from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Our blisibimod portfolio includes exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen Inc.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P102_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P105_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications; we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions; others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies; any of our or our licensors' pending patent applications will result in issued patents; any of our or our licensors' patents will be valid or enforceable; any patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; we will develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable; or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We are aware of two families of third party United States patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P108_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent's claims.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P108_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P108_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P108_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P110_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P110_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P110_S3	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P110_S4	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P110_S5	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P110_S6	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P111_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We have obtained exclusive, worldwide licenses, except for Japan, of the composition of matter, methods of making and methods of use for certain sPLA2 compounds from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P112_S1	In addition, we are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize blisibimod a novel BAFF inhibitor, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P112_S2	We may enter into additional licenses to third-party intellectual property in the future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering our in-licensed sPLA2 compounds and blisibimod, respectively.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P113_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P113_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P113_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P113_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P113_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P114_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P115_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and to obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P116_S0	The United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act," provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in the regulatory approval process.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Assuming we gain a five-year patent term extension for each of our current product candidates in clinical development, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to these product candidates, we would have exclusive rights to varespladib's U.S. "new chemical entity" patent (the primary patent covering the compound as a new composition of matter) until 2019 and to blisibimod's U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2027.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P117_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Assuming we gain such a five-year extension for each of our current product candidates in clinical development, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to these product candidates, we would have exclusive rights to varespladib's European new chemical entity patents until 2020 and to blisibimod's European new chemical entity patents until 2027.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P117_S2	In addition, since varespladib has not been previously approved in the United States, varespladib could be eligible for up to five years of New Chemical Entity, or NCE, exclusivity from the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P117_S3	NCE exclusivity would prevent the FDA from approving any generic competitor following NDA approval independent of the patent status of varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P117_S4	Further, since blisibimod has not been previously approved, blisibimod could be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity from the FDA.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P118_S0	relying on the innovator biologic's safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small molecule compound or biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that compound or biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P118_S2	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P118_S3	However, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P118_S4	If we fail to receive such Hatch-Waxman extensions or marketing exclusivity rights or if we receive extensions that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P119_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We typically develop our product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds' production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P120_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of these product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P120_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P121_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell any of our product candidates or proposed product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P121_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidate.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P122_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications' earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P122_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P122_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P123_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P125_S1	If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidates and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P126_S2	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P126_S3	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors' existing or future patents.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P128_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P129_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P129_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P131_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P132_S0	additions or departures of any of our key personnel; announcements related to litigation; changing legal or regulatory developments in the United States and other countries; and discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P133_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P133_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P133_S5	These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P134_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P134_S1	We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P134_S2	Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management's attention from our business.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Because a small number of our existing stockholders own a majority of our voting stock, your ability to influence corporate matters will be limited.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 60% of our outstanding common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P136_S1	As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P136_S2	These persons will also have the ability to control our management and business affairs.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P136_S3	This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P138_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there were 40,938,041 shares of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P138_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock units of 2,490,146 that, if exercised or released, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P138_S2	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P138_S3	Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P138_S4	Moreover, certain holders of shares of common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P139_S0	We have registered all common stock that we may issue under our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan") and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP").
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P139_S1	As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of 1,748,858 shares of our common stock has been reserved for future issuance under the 2010 Plan, plus any shares reserved and unissued or cancelled under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, and an aggregate of 350,000 shares has been reserved for future issuance under our ESPP.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P139_S2	These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P139_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P140_S0	We filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179043) on January 17, 2012, which was declared effective on January 24, 2012, for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P140_S1	We may issue securities in the future pursuant to the shelf registration statement based on market conditions or other circumstances.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P142_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P143_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P145_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P145_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P145_S2	For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P145_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P146_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P146_S1	Commencing in 2011, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P146_S2	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P146_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P147_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P148_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P148_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P151_S0	a classified and staggered board of directors whose members can only be dismissed for cause; the prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders; the limitation on who may call a special meeting of stockholders; the establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which would increase the number of outstanding shares and could thwart a takeover attempt; and the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P152_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P152_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P152_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation's stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P154_S1	An ownership change may limit a company's ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P154_S2	We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has occurred after each of our previous private placements of preferred stock and convertible debt, or our previous issuances of common stock, which if sufficient, taking into account prior or future shifts in our ownership over a three-year period, could cause us to undergo an ownership change.
1316175_12_ITEM1A_P154_S3	As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company leases its main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We occupied 7,800 square feet under a sublease that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2008 and was then amended in April 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	The new lease commenced on August 1, 2011 and includes approximately $245,000 in tenant improvement reimbursements from the landlord.
1316175_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	footage from 7,800 square feet to approximately 14,000 square feet.
1316175_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	The new lease expires on September 30, 2014.
1316175_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We believe there is no litigation pending that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "ANTH" since our initial public offering ("IPO").
1316175_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that offering, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Market:
1316175_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of 40,938,041 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by approximately 1,100 holders of record and beneficial holders, based on information provided by the Company's transfer agent.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Nasdaq Biotech Index from March 1, 2010 (the first day our stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market through December 31, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on March 1, 2010 in each of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Biotech Index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	The past performance of our common stock is no indication of future performance.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P4_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III of this report.
1316175_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	All information under this Item has been previously reported on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
1316175_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	We did not repurchase any securities during the quarter ended December 31, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	(2) For accounting purposes only, the number of issued and outstanding shares do not include weighted-average shares of unvested stock for the year ended December 31, 2007 of 261,649, for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 230,028, for the year ended December 31, 2009 of 110,079, for the year ended December 31, 2010 of 47,654 and for the year ended December 31, 2011 of 13,374.
1316175_12_ITEM6_P0_S2	These shares are subject to a risk of repurchase by us until such shares are vested.
1316175_12_ITEM6_P0_S3	See Note 2 of our financial statements for more information.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes set forth under "Item 8.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	We currently have one Phase 2 clinical program, blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Two of our product candidates, varespladib and varespladib sodium, are designed to inhibit a novel enzyme target known as secretory phospholipase A2, or sPLA2.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Elevated levels of sPLA2 have been implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as in chronic diseases, including stable coronary artery disease.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition, our Phase 2 product candidate, blisibimod, targets elevated levels of B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, lupus nephritis vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sj gren's Syndrome, Graves' Disease and others.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	On March 9, 2012, an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended stopping the Company's VISTA-16 clinical study for varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	After review of the totality of evidence, including the emerging unblinded data from VISTA-16, the DSMB was unanimous in its view that there was cogent evidence to recommend early termination of the trial.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	According to the DSMB, the chief reason is the inability of VISTA-16 to detect a statistically significant benefit of the drug on the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints even if the trial continues to its scheduled termination.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	We believe that the DSMB's decision was based on the belief that the risk profile of the drug would not outweigh any benefit.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	As a result, we have closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy immediately.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P4_S5	We have also closed enrollment in our IMPACTS-2 clinical study for varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	While data continues to be made available to us, and while we continue to assess these data, based on the DSMB recommendation we expect that we will not engage in any further development activities of our sPLA 2 portfolio.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We were incorporated and commenced operations in September 2004.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Since our inception, we have generated significant losses.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $201.0 million.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	In January 2012, Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The establishment of this subsidiary was part of the Company's ongoing growth activities and strategic plan.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	As of the date of this filing, we have never generated any revenue and have generated only interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	We expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	To date, we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt and debt financings, raising net proceeds of approximately $224.4 million.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	risks associated with development-stage companies, we may never successfully complete development of any of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	We do not expect to generate revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates or in-license additional products that generate revenue.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	We intend to seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales, up-front fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships and royalties resulting from the licensing of the commercial rights to our intellectual property.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the nature, timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized, as well as any revenue we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidate development programs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: licensing, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for our Phase 2b clinical study named PEARL-SC for blisibimod, as well as for the development of our other product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	We are developing our product candidates in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project, but rather are allocated across our clinical stage programs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related "fringe benefit" costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, and for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	(1) Includes milestone payments of $3.5 million pursuant to amendments to the license agreements with each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co. Ltd., which were paid in the form of shares of common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	(2) Includes license fees of $4.0 million pursuant to a license agreement with each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co. Ltd., which were paid in cash and shares of preferred stock in 2006.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	(3) Includes a one-time license initiation fee of $6.0 million pursuant to a license agreement with Amgen.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We completed enrollment in the PEARL-SC study of blisibimod in October 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	We intend to fund our clinical studies with existing cash and proceeds from potential future debt and equity offerings.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	As we obtain results from clinical studies, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Completion of clinical studies may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	The cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including:
1316175_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	the number of sites included in the studies; the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects; the number of patients that participate in the studies; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; and the duration of patient follow-up.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	Expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones such as number of patients enrolled.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	None of our product candidates have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions, including clinical, chemical manufacturing, regulatory, finance and business development.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical studies; fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical study materials; and fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	We base our accruals related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Compensation costs related to all equity instruments, excluding restricted stock units ("RSUs"), are recognized at the grant date fair value of the awards.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	RSUs are accounted for as a liability award, and as such the fair value of the awards are remeasured at each reporting date.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	Additionally, we are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	We account for stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact stock-based compensation expense.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs for employees in clinical, chemical manufacturing and regulatory functions, clinical studies performed by CROs, pharmaceutical development costs including product formulation and manufacturing, preclinical costs, license fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Change in research and development expenses from the years ended December 31, 2010 to 2011 (in millions):
1316175_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Research and development expenses increased due primarily to increased clinical trial costs associated with our Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib and Phase 2 clinical study of blisibimod of approximately $41.2 million.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The trial costs increased as a result of continued enrollment and the addition of clinical sites for the VISTA-16 and PEARL-SC clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	approximately $13.9 million over the prior period.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Furthermore, we increased headcount to support our clinical development activities, which resulted in increased salaries and benefits of $2.0 million.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for employees in executive, business development and operational functions, professional service fees including corporate legal fees, accountant fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Change in general and administrative expenses from the years ended December 31, 2010 to 2011 (in millions):
1316175_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	General and administrative expenses increased due primarily to increased headcount and related salaries and benefits to support our expanding business activities, and increased professional services incurred in connection with operating as a public company.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Other income/expense consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and realized gains relating to short term investments.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Other income/expense was approximately $0.6 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $0.02 million of expense for the prior year.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	The change is primarily a result of increased income on higher cash and investment balances in 2011 as compared to the prior year due to proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable and equity offering.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	Further included in the year ended December 31, 2011 were realized foreign currency gains of approximately $0.4 million on short-term investments.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest expense was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $0.8 million for the prior year.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 consists primarily of interest expense, amortization of note discount and note issuance costs, and charges recorded for an end-of-term payment associated with our notes issued under a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. and Hercules Technology II, L.P. (together, "Hercules") in March 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 consists of primarily non-cash charges related to the amortization of discounts associated with our convertible promissory notes issued in July and September of 2009, which were converted into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO in March 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs for employees in clinical, chemical manufacturing and regulatory functions, clinical studies performed by CROs, pharmaceutical development costs including product formulation and manufacturing, preclinical costs, license fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Change in research and development expenses from the years ended December 31, 2009 to 2010 (in millions):
1316175_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib and Phase 2 clinical study of blisibimod, as well as increased headcount to support these clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for employees in executive, business development and operational functions, professional service fees including corporate legal fees, accountant fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Change in general and administrative expenses from the years ended December 31, 2009 to 2010 (in millions):
1316175_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to increased headcount and professional services incurred in connection with our financial audit and other costs associated with operating as a public company.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other income/expense consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and realized gains relating to short term investments.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	Other expense was approximately $0.02 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $0.2 million of expense for the prior period.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The decrease in expense is primarily a result of increased income on higher cash and investment balances in 2010 as compared to the prior year.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 consists of primarily non-cash charges related to the amortization of discounts associated with our convertible promissory notes issued in July and September of 2009, which were converted into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering ("IPO") in March 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Interest expense in 2009 was attributable to outstanding convertible debt that was converted to shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of the Company's IPO.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt, debt financings, and our IPO.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had received net proceeds of approximately $173.5 million from the sale of equity securities, approximately $26.3 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, and approximately $24.7 million from the issuance of notes payable.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $67.4 million.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following (in thousands):

1316175_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The primary drivers for the difference are adjustments for non-cash charges of $4.6 million in clinical trial accruals and changes in other operating assets and liabilities of $14.4 million, which are based upon our estimated clinical trial performance to date.

1316175_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	On March 25, 2011, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement ("Loan Agreement") with Hercules.

1316175_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	The loan is secured by the Company's assets, excluding intellectual property.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	The Company will make interest only payments for the initial 15 months.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P68_S4	Thereafter, the loan will be repaid in 30 equal monthly installments of approximately $1.0 million, at the initial interest rate.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P68_S5	The Company will also be obligated to pay an end of the term charge of $0.9 million, which is being expensed over the term of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest rate.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table summarizes our estimated scheduled future minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	(1) Interest payments reflected are estimated based on an interest rate of 10.55% throughout the term of the note, plus an additional end of term charge of $938.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	The above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidates in development, as these payments are not determinable.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Under our license agreement with Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialize certain sPLA 2 inhibitors, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial objectives.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	Our obligation to pay royalties with respect to each licensed product in each country will expire upon the later of (a) 10 years following the date of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, and (b) the first date on which generic version(s) of the applicable licensed product achieve a total market share, in the aggregate, of 25% or more of the total unit sales of wholesalers to pharmacies of licensed product and all generic versions combined in the applicable country.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Also excluded from the table above are potential milestone payments on the development of blisibimod.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Under our license agreement with Amgen to develop and commercialize blisibimod, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	licensed product will be payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicensee in such country, or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to advance our product candidates into preclinical studies and clinical studies and as we:
1316175_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	continue clinical development of blisibimod; hire additional clinical, scientific and management personnel; and implement new operational, financial and management information systems.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	the progress of preclinical development and clinical studies of our product candidates; the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; delays that may be caused by evolving requirements of regulatory agencies; the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims; our ability to establish, enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances; and the acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	We do not expect to generate commercial product revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	We expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in cash used in operations over the next several years.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including the progress and results of our clinical studies, the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates, our revenue, if any, from successful development and commercialization of our product candidates, the costs of commercialization activities, the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical studies for other product candidates, the emergence of competing therapies and other market developments, the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights, the extent to which we acquire or invest in other product candidates and technologies, and our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone, royalty or other payments from any collaborators.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	As of the date of this report, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to conduct additional or extended clinical studies and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to terminate, significantly modify or delay our development programs, reduce our planned commercialization efforts, or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1316175_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, since a majority of our investments are in short-term certificates of deposit, FDIC-insured corporate bonds and money market funds, we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any material derivative financial instruments.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our marketable securities, including those included in cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $67.4 million as of December 31, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary.
1316175_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other-than-temporary impairment charges.
1316175_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this item are set forth beginning in Item 15 of this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management performed, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.

1316175_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures which pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management's and/or the Board of Directors' authorization; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material errors in our financial statements.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with our policies and procedures may deteriorate.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, using the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on our assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

1316175_12_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P11_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P12_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P12_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1316175_12_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1316175_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $67.4 million at December 31, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	As of the date of this report, the Company anticipates that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to fund its near term liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P24_S2	The Company's current plan includes obtaining top-line data from its PEARL-SC clinical study during 2012 and to investigate the structure of future trials and research and development activities for its product candidates.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P24_S3	To maintain liquidity for the next 12 months using our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, the Company's plan assumes the deferral of substantially all development and operational costs beyond those necessary for top-line data from its PEARL-SC clinical study and, if necessary, a reduction in certain general and administrative and research and development expenses.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Prior to initiating any new trial studies for its product candidates, the Company would need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities, or securing other financing.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and sustain its operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company will need substantial additional financing to conduct new trials in the development of its product candidates and to obtain regulatory approvals.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	Such financing may not be available on terms favorable to it, if at all.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P26_S2	Further, these activities may span many years and require substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P26_S3	Any delays in completing these activities could adversely impact the Company.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	potential partnership upfront and milestone payments, issuances of equity securities, debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve its intended business objectives.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	On February 26, 2010, the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective for its initial public offering ("IPO"), pursuant to which the Company sold 6,000,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	The Company received net proceeds of approximately $37.1 million from this transaction.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	Concurrent with the closing of the IPO, the Company received an aggregate of $17.1 million from the issuance of 2,598,780 shares of its common stock to certain of its investors pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement.

1316175_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical accounting policies or estimates related to clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash currencies, for which the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company has designated its investments as available for sale and the investment are carried at fair value.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	Securities with maturity exceeding three months but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P35_S3	Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on specific identification method and are reported in the statements of operations.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P35_S4	The Company includes any unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments in stockholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).
1316175_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	The Company's cash equivalents consist of certificates of deposit with maturities less than three months and treasury money market funds.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	The Company's short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit and corporate bonds with maturities exceeding three months but less than one year.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P36_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P36_S4	The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to five years, using the straight-line method.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the life of the related asset, whichever is shorter.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company's long-lived assets and other assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of the FASB whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	Through December 31, 2011, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company makes estimates of its accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on the Company's behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P42_S2	The majority of service providers invoice at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	The Company periodically confirms the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and makes adjustments if necessary.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical studies; fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical study materials; and fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	Accruals related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on the Company's behalf.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	In accruing service fees, the Company estimates the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expensed in each period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from estimates, the accrual is adjusted accordingly.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	If costs are not identified or if the Company underestimates or overestimates the level of services performed or the costs of these services, actual expenses could differ from estimates.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development, and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P48_S2	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with product formulation and chemical analysis.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company charges research and development costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred, consistent with the guidance of the FASB.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	Clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	All of the Company's clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	The Company accrues costs for clinical studies performed by CROs based on patient enrollment activities and adjusts the estimates, if required, based upon the Company's ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P49_S4	The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the CROs, and adjusts the estimates, if required, on a monthly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended by each CRO.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	All material CRO contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and the Company is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain noncancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Amounts paid in advance related to incomplete services will be refunded if a contract is terminated.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	Some contracts include additional termination payments that become due and payable if the Company terminates the contract.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	Such additional termination payments are only recorded if a contract is terminated.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	In 2010, research and development costs were offset by $1 million of grant monies received for certain research and development costs as provided by Section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Comprehensive loss consists of certain changes in equity that are excluded from net loss.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Specifically, the Company includes unrealized losses on available for sale securities and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash equivalents and short-term investments in other comprehensive loss.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	Comprehensive loss for each period presented is set forth in the Statement of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Loss.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with guidance issued by the FASB, which prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company operates in only one segment.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P56_S3	In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P56_S4	The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Diluted EPS is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's calculation of net loss per common share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	The following table shows weighted-average historical dilutive common share equivalents outstanding, which are not included in the above calculation, as the effect of their inclusion is anti-dilutive during each period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial statements over the employees' requisite service period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option's expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Compensation costs related to all equity instruments granted after January 1, 2006 are recognized at the grant-date fair value of the awards.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	Additionally, the Company is required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term represents the period that the Company's stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Expected Volatility Expected volatility is estimated using comparable public company volatility for similar terms.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has never paid dividends and has no plans to pay dividends.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing method is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	The estimated forfeiture rate is determined based on the Company's historical forfeiture rates to date.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company monitors actual expenses and periodically updates the estimate.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with guidance provided by the FASB and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and recognized as expense over the related service period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Prepaid expenses and other current assets are comprised of the following (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Property and equipment are comprised of the following (in thousands):

1316175_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2010 were as follows:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	Realized losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were immaterial.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and readily accessible by us at the reporting date.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs are cost method investments, auction rate securities (ARS) and the Primary Fund.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	The following tables present the Company's fair value hierarchy for all its financial assets (including those in cash and cash equivalents), in thousands, by major security type measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company leases its main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company began occupying this operating facility in the fourth quarter of 2008 and amended its lease for the facility in April 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Pursuant to the amendment, the lease increased the Company's square footage from 7,800 square feet to approximately 14,000 square feet.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	The new lease expires on September 30, 2014.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	The Company recognizes rental expense on the facility on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P82_S3	Differences between the straight line net expense on rent payments is classified as deferred rent liability on the balance sheet.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Rent expense was as follows (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	As of December 31, 2011, future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):

1316175_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Under the terms of the Eli Lilly Agreement, the Company's license is worldwide, with the exception of Japan where Shionogi Co., Ltd. has retained rights.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	Pursuant to this license agreement, the Company paid Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Eli Lilly a one-time license initiation fee of $250,000 in the aggregate.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	Additionally, in consideration for the licensed technology, the Company issued an aggregate of 257,744 shares of Series A-2 convertible preferred stock at $5.14 per share and an aggregate of 127,297 shares of Series B-1 convertible preferred stock at $7.28 per share with a total aggregate value of $2.3 million to Shionogi Co., Ltd. and Eli Lilly.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	As there is no future alternative use for the technology, the Company recorded the initiation and license fees in research and development expenses during 2006.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P86_S4	In March 2010, the Company paid $1.75 million each to Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. in the form of the Company's common stock upon the commencement of the Company's Phase 3 VISTA-16 study of varespladib.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	Under the terms of the Eli Lilly Agreement, the Company is obligated to make additional milestone payments to Eli Lilly of up to $97.5 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	The Company is also obligated to pay tiered royalties, which increase as a percentage from the mid-single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase, on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	The Company's obligation to pay royalties with respect to each licensed product in each country will expire upon the later of (a) 10 years following the date of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country and (b) the first date on which generic version(s) of the applicable licensed product achieve a total market share, in the aggregate, of 25% or more of the total unit sales of wholesalers to pharmacies of licensed product and all generic versions combined in the applicable country.

1316175_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	The Company's royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P89_S3	As of December 31, 2011, there were no outstanding obligations due to Amgen.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	In March 2011, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement ("Loan Agreement") with Hercules.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed $25.0 million at an interest rate of the higher of (i) 10.55% or (ii) 7.30% plus the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal, and issued to Hercules a secured term promissory note evidencing the loan.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	The loan is secured by the Company's assets, excluding intellectual property.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P90_S3	The Company will make interest only payments for the initial 15 months.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P90_S4	Thereafter, the loan will be repaid in 30 equal monthly installments of approximately $952,000, at the initial interest rate.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P90_S5	The Company will also be obligated to pay an end of the term charge of $937,500, which will be expensed over the term of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest method.

1316175_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company estimated the fair value of this warrant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following assumptions: expected term of seven years, a risk-free interest rate of 2.87%, expected volatility of 63% and 0% expected dividend yield.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company applied the relative fair value method to allocate the $25.0 million proceeds received under the Loan Agreement between the loan and warrant.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The initial carrying amount assigned to the loan was $23.7 million and was recorded as Notes payable net of discount on the Company's balance sheet.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	We believe the carrying amount at December 31, 2011 approximates fair value.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	The fair value allocated to the warrant of $1.3 million was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the Company's balance sheet.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P93_S4	The resulting $1.3 million discount from the $25.0 million par value of the loan is being amortized as an additional interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P93_S5	At December 31, 2011, this warrant remained outstanding and exercisable.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company incurred note issuance costs of approximately $370,200, which are recorded as long-term assets on the Company's balance sheet.

1316175_12_ITEM15_P110_S3	The fair value of the warrants was calculated to be $224,478 and recorded as issuance cost and an increase to additional paid-in capital.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P110_S4	As of December 31, 2009, 240,516, warrants remain outstanding.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Each of the warrants contained a net issuance feature, which allowed the warrant holder to pay the exercise price of the warrant by forfeiting a portion of the exercised warrant shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P111_S1	The warrants were exercised upon the closing of the Company's IPO on March 4, 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	In connection with the issuance of the 2009 notes for $10.0 million, as discussed in Note 9, the Company issued warrants to each note holder to purchase shares of its equity securities.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P112_S1	Each 2009 warrant is exercisable for the security into which each 2009 note is converted, at the price at which that security is sold to other investors.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	after April 1, 2010, by (y) the purchase price of the securities into which the note is ultimately converted.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company accounted for the 2009 warrants in accordance with guidance provided by the FASB, which requires that a financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, that, at inception, is indexed to an obligation to repurchase the issuer's equity shares, regardless of the timing of the redemption feature, and may require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets, be classified as liability through the completion of the Company's IPO.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Company measured the fair value of the 2009 warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on issuance date and adjusted the fair value at the end of each reporting period based on the following assumptions:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company then applied probability factors to the different possible conversion scenarios and calculated the initial fair value of the 2009 warrants to be $320,000, which amount was recorded as a discount to the 2009 notes.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	The discount was amortized as interest expense over the terms of the 2009 notes.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P115_S2	The Company re-measured the fair value of the 2009 warrants on December 31, 2009 and recorded the change in fair value in non-operating income.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P115_S3	Upon conversion of the 2009 notes into shares of common stock at the completion of the Company's IPO, the fair value of the 2009 warrants was re-measured again by the Company and the change in fair value of $1.5 million was recorded in non-operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P115_S4	Concurrent with the conversion of the 2009 notes, the Company calculated the number of warrant shares to be 357,136 based on 25% of the principal amount of the accompanying 2009 notes and the IPO price of the Company's common stock of $7.00 per share.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P115_S5	The warrant liability and unamortized discount were reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as a result of the conversion of the 2009 notes.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	In connection with the issuance of the escrow notes for $3.4 million, as discussed in Note 9, which were exchangeable for exchange notes, each exchange note that was issued would be accompanied by a warrant, which was exercisable for the security into which the accompanying exchange note, if any, was converted, at the price at which that security was sold to other investors.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P116_S1	Depending on when the exchange notes are converted, each warrant may be exercisable for a number of shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) (i) 25% of the principal amount of the accompanying exchange notes, in the event the conversion occurs prior to April 1, 2010, or (ii) 50% of the principal amount of the accompanying exchange notes, in the event the conversion occurs on or after April 1, 2010, by (y) the purchase price of the securities into which the exchange note is ultimately converted.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P116_S2	The Company accounts for the potential issuance of the warrants in accordance with guidance provided by the FASB.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company measured the fair value of its derivative using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility of 78%, risk-free interest rate of 2.34% and expected term of five years.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Company then applied probability factors to the different possible exchange and conversion scenarios and calculated the fair value of the warrants to be $0.09 million, which amount was recorded as a discount to the escrow notes.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P117_S2	The discount was amortized as interest expense over the terms of the escrow notes.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P117_S3	The escrow notes were converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of its IPO.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	As a result of the conversion taking place prior to the exchange of the escrow notes into exchange notes, the Company's obligation to issue the warrants was eliminated.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	Consequently, the Company reclassified the unamortized discount into additional paid-in capital and reduced the fair value of the warrant liability to zero.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	On September 24, 2010, the Company closed a private placement transaction with certain accredited investors pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 10,500,000 units at a purchase price of $3.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional 0.40 shares of common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P119_S1	Each warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time until September 24, 2015 at a per share exercise price of $3.30, subject to certain adjustments as specified in the warrant.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company valued the warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility of 64%, risk-free interest rate of 1.37% and expected term of five years.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P120_S1	The fair value of the warrants was calculated to be $5.3 million and has been recorded in additional paid-in capital.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P120_S2	As of December 31, 2011, 4,133,333 warrants remain outstanding.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	Each of the warrants contains a net issuance feature, which allows the warrant holder to pay the exercise price of the warrant by forfeiting a portion of the exercised warrant shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	The 2009 notes and the escrow notes discussed in Note 9 contained a contingent automatic redemption feature and a contingent put option that meet the definition of an embedded derivative as defined by guidance provided by the FASB, as these notes contain features with implicit or explicit terms that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of other exchanges required by a contract in a manner similar to a derivative instrument.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	The Company evaluated these embedded derivative features and determined that the embedded derivative features should be separated from the 2009 notes and escrow notes and recognized as derivative instruments.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P122_S2	Pursuant to the guidance provided by the FASB, if a hybrid instrument contains more than one embedded derivative feature that would individually warrant separate accounting as a derivative instrument, those embedded derivative features shall be bundled together as a single, compound embedded derivative that shall then be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the host contract unless a fair value election is made.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P122_S3	Since the Company may not make a fair value election, the contingent automatic redemption and the contingent put option should be bundled together as a single, compound embedded derivative and separated from the 2009 notes and escrow notes.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P122_S4	The Company recognized the bundled embedded derivative as a derivative liability with initial and subsequent measurements at fair value and changes in fair value recorded in earnings.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P122_S5	Upon conversion of the 2009 notes and escrow notes into shares of common stock at the completion of the Company's IPO, the Company re-measured the fair value of the embedded derivative and recorded a charge of $2.5 million in non-operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	The Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan") was adopted by the board of directors in January 2005.

1316175_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	There was $3.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense as of December 31, 2011 related to options.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	The unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining period of 2.92 years.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	Information about stock options outstanding, vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2011, is as follows:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there are 171,434 shares available for grant under the 2010 Plan.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	The Company grants restricted stock unit awards ("RSUs") under its 2010 Plan, as determined by the Company's compensation committee.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	The restricted stock units granted represent a right to receive shares of common stock at a future date determined in accordance with the participant's award agreement.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P137_S2	An exercise price and monetary payment are not required for receipt of restricted stock units or the shares issued in settlement of the award.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P137_S3	Instead, consideration is furnished in the form of the participant's services to the Company.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P137_S4	Substantially all of the RSUs vest over four years.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	In June 2011, the Company amended the 2010 Plan to allow individuals who had received RSUs to net share settle in excess of the minimum statutory withholding amount for taxes.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB, this modification resulted in the RSUs being classified as a liability, and the subsequent change in fair value to be recorded as expense.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P138_S2	The unsettled RSUs are remeasured at each reporting date and will continue to be remeasured until they are fully vested in approximately 3 years.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P138_S3	Any changes in valuation are recorded as compensation expense for the period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the liability related to the unsettled awards was not significant.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The following table summarizes activity related to our restricted stock units:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Stock options granted under the Company's 2005 Plan provide employee option holders the right to elect to exercise unvested options in exchange for restricted common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Unvested shares, which amounted to 4,687 and 27,321 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, were subject to a repurchase right held by the Company at the original issuance price in the event the optionees' employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P141_S2	For exercises of employee options, this right lapses 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting start date and in 36 equal monthly amounts thereafter.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P141_S3	These repurchase terms are considered to be a forfeiture provision and do not result in variable accounting.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	The shares purchased by the employees pursuant to the early exercise of stock options are not deemed to be outstanding until those shares vest.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	In addition, cash received from employees for exercise of unvested options is treated as a refundable deposit shown as a liability in the Company's financial statements.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, cash received for early exercise of options was not significant.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	As the shares vest, the shares and liability are released into common stock and additional paid-in capital.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	The activity of early exercise of options granted to employees is as follows:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	In July 2010, the Company's stockholders approved the ESPP.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	The Company reserved 100,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder plus on January 1, 2011 and each January 1 thereafter, the number of shares of stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) 250,000 shares of common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	Under the ESPP, eligible employees of the Company and certain designated subsidiaries of the Company may authorize the Company to deduct amounts from their compensation, which amounts are used to enable the employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	The purchase price per share is 85% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the first date or the ending date of the applicable semi-annual purchase period, whichever is less (the "Look-Back Provision").
1316175_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	The 15% discount and the Look-Back Provision make the ESPP compensatory under guidance issued by the FASB.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to value the employee stock purchase rights.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and the period from September 9, 2004 (Inception Date) through December 31, 2011, the following weighted-average assumptions were used in the valuation of the stock purchase rights:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense, including expense recorded for the ESPP, was as follows (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value stock options are as follows:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan, or the 401(k) Plan.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	Employee contributions are voluntary and are determined on an individual basis, limited by the maximum amounts allowable under federal tax regulations.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P151_S2	The Company has made no contributions to the 401(k) Plan since its inception.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company has incurred net operating losses since inception.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	The Company has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards in the accompanying financial statements and has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 2011, 2010, and 2009 is as follows:
1316175_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	Because of the Company's recent history of operating losses, management believes that recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a valuation allowance.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	Because of the Company's recent history of operating losses, management believes that the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits are currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P157_S2	The net valuation allowance increased by $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $80.9 million for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	Net operating losses and tax return credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2011, are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, and similar state provisions.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	The Company has not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC has occurred.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P159_S2	The effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards attributable to periods before the change.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1.8 million, all of which would not currently affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company's deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P160_S1	The Company did not anticipate any significant change to the unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2011.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P160_S2	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	The Company would classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, if applicable.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P161_S1	There was no interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through December 31, 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P161_S2	The tax years 2004 through 2010 remain open to examination by one or more major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized net tax benefits will significantly change prior to the end of 2012.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	Quarterly results were as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Company engaged an outside service provider whose chief executive officer is a founder of the Company and spouse of an officer of the Company, for clinical management services.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	In consideration for the services rendered, the Company paid the following fees (in thousands):
1316175_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $1.1 million payable to this organization for services performed during the period compared to approximately $0.5 million payable as of December 31, 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	There were no changes to the scope of services performed by this entity during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P165_S2	Further, we anticipate this relationship to continue for the foreseeable future.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	On March 9, 2012, an independent data safety monitoring board recommended stopping the Company's VISTA-16 clinical study for varespladib due to a lack efficacy that could not be reasonably overcome in the remainder of the trial.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	As a result, the Company has closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy immediately.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P166_S2	The Company believes that the DSMB's decision was based on the belief that the risk profile of the drug would not outweigh any benefit.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P166_S3	The Company has also closed enrollment in its IMPACTS-2 clinical study for varespladib sodium.
1316175_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	While data continues to be made available, and while the Company continues to assess these data, based on the DSMB recommendation to stop the VISTA-16 study for varespladib, the Company expects not to engage in any further development activities of its sPLA 2 portfolio.

1316175_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat autoimmune diseases.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	We currently have one Phase 3 ready product candidate, blisibimod, which targets elevated levels of B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or lupus, Immunoglobin A nephropathy, or IgAN, lupus nephritis, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and others.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	BAFF, also known as BLyS, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of B-cells.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	B-cells are a vital part of the human immune system producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Abnormal elevations in BAFF and B-cells have been correlated with several autoimmune diseases.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell concentrations in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	We intend to advance the clinical development of our BAFF inhibitor, blisibimod, to exploit its broad potential clinical utility in a number of autoimmune diseases.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture which contrasts with antibody therapeutics that are typically manufactured in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages including ease of manufacture and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane bound BAFF.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have worldwide rights to blisibimod in all potential indications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2012, we completed a Phase 2b clinical study named PEARL-SC, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous blisibimod in patients with active and seropositive lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Lupus patients suffer from chronic autoimmune disease, where an inappropriate or abnormal immune response often leads to severe skin rash, fatigue, joint pain, major kidney complications and cardiovascular disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Inhibition of BAFF is believed to reduce survival and subsequent elevations in B-cells leading to a reduction in severity of disease and resolution of Lupus symptoms.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our product development programs are focused on blisibimod and its use as therapeutic treatments for lupus and other serious autoimmune diseases for which we believe current treatments are either inadequate or non-existent.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our current plan includes commencing the CHABLIS-SC and BRIGHT-SC clinical studies, continuing the ongoing blisibimod open label extension safety and efficacy study, or OLE study, and investigating the structure of future clinical studies and research and development activities.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Anthera has successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch scale volumes and has sufficient inventory to support the CHABLIS-SC and BRIGHT-SC clinical studies in 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The blisibimod product is designed for at-home, self-administration and is presented as a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We are actively pursuing various partnerships with major pharmaceutical and biotech companies to develop and commercialize blisibimod for both lupus and additional indications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our current development plans include the phase 3 development of blisibimod for lupus and a focus on orphan indications, which may provide an accelerated and cost-efficient path to regulatory approval and commercialization both in the United States and Asia.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe that certain of these markets and product opportunities for blisibimod can be commercialized through utilization of a limited specialty sales force targeting a small set of clinical specialists.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	In addition, we believe blisibimod may address market opportunities in chronic indications such as lupus and to maximize these opportunities we may seek development and commercialization partners to address non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Blisibimod (also referred to as A-623) is a peptibody antagonist of the BAFF cytokine that we are developing as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus and IgAN.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	BAFF, also known as BLyS, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of B-cells.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	B-cells represent a critical component of a human immune response to infection and other pathogens.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	However abnormal elevations of B-cells, often accompanied by elevations in BAFF, may lead to an over active immune response which may damage normal healthy tissues and organ systems.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production are known to be central to the process.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF plays an important role in these disease processes.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	In preclinical studies in mice that develop lupus-like disease, BAFF is known to be elevated, and treatment with blisibimod improves outcomes and survival.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	Similarly, in IgAN, mice that over-express BAFF develop a fatal nephropathy associated with IgA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	According to the Journal of Arthritis and Rheumatism the prevalence of lupus is estimated to be between 50 and 150 per 100,000 in the United States.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Journal of Arthritis and Rheumatism estimates similar prevalence rates for Europe and Asia.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	IgAN is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis throughout the world, although the U.S. prevalence is estimated at approximately 130,000 patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	The prevalence of IgAN varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong), Australia, Finland, and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulnephritis).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	In April of 2012 we completed a Phase 2b clinical study, called PEARL-SC, with blisibimod for the treatment of patients with seropositive markers of lupus and active disease defined as SELENA-SLEDAI score of greater than 6.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	The primary endpoint of the PEARL-SC study was a clinical improvement in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus responder index, or SRI-5, at week 24 for the pooled blisibimod dose groups versus pooled placebo groups.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	SRI-5 is defined as a five-point improvement in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new BILAG A or two B scores, and no increase in a physician s global assessment of more than 0.3 points.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	In June and July of 2012 we announced results from the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study which we believe support the initiation of a differentiated Phase 3 registration plan utilizing the 200mg weekly dose of blisibimod in patients with active lupus, despite the concomitant use of corticosteroids.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	While the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint in the PEARL-SC clinical study was not met due to an apparent lack of clinical efficacy in the two lowest dose groups, additional prospective data from the PEARL-SC study suggest consistent treatment benefits in the 200mg weekly dose group when utilizing higher thresholds of disease improvement, as measured by larger point reductions in SELENA-SLEDAI scoring index.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	In addition, in a subgroup population of severely ill, seropositive lupus patients, defined as those patients having a SELENA-SLEDAI score of greater or equal to ten who were also receiving background corticosteroid medication at the time of randomization, a more pronounced treatment benefit was seen with the blisibimod 200mg weekly dose compared to other doses.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Using a higher treatment threshold of an eight point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI, or an SRI-8 endpoint, in this enhanced subgroup population, the 200mg blisibimod treatment group demonstrated a 15.6% treatment difference compared to pooled placebo (41.7% versus 26.1%, p 0.05) and 31.1% treatment difference compare to treatment matched placebo (41.7% versus 10.6%, p 0.001) at 24 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	In this subgroup, which we plan to enroll in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies, separation of clinical response occurred as early as week eight and numerical differences were observed beyond week 24.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	All doses of blisibimod demonstrated consistent serological response including reductions of B-cells, double-stranded-DNA antibodies and improvement in complement levels.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	An SRI-5 responder achieved all of the following: 5 point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, AND no new BILAG A or 2B organ domain scores, AND no worsening ( 0.3 increase) in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Across all subjects enrolled in the PEARL-SC study, the percent of subjects achieving the SRI-5 at 24 weeks was higher in subjects receiving the highest dose of blisibimod (200mg QW) compared with placebo.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	SRI improvements compared with placebo were generally higher in subjects who attained SELENA SLEDAI improvements of 6, 7, 8 (SRI-6, SRI-7, and SRI-8, respectively).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Graphs show data for blisibimod (200mg once-weekly) and treatment matched or pooled placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	An SRI-5 responder achieved all of the following: 5 point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, AND no new BILAG A or 2B organ domain scores, AND no worsening ( 0.3 increase) in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	In a subgroup analysis of patients with severe lupus disease (SELENA SLEDAI 10 and receiving steroid at baseline, n=278), the percent of subjects achieving the SRI-5 was higher in subjects receiving the highest dose of blisibimod (200mg QW) compared with placebo.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	SRI improvements compared with placebo were higher still in subjects who attained SELENA SLEDAI improvements of 6, 7, 8 (SRI-6, SRI-7, and SRI-8, respectively).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	Graph shows data for blisibimod (200mg once-weekly) and regimen matched placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks .
1316175_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	The following table shows the N values at the different time points in the graph above.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	*SRI is defined as patients who respond to treatment and achieve a reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI equal to or greater than the number indicated, no new BILAG A or two B organ domain scores, and no increase in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of greater than 0.3 on a three point scale.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	To date, three (3) randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two (2) Phase 1 dose-ranging studies in which a total of 104 patients were randomized, and a Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical outcomes study in which 547 subjects were enrolled.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	In all three (3) studies, statistically significant reductions in total B-cells were observed in patients treated with blisibimod versus those treated with placebo due to its mechanism of BAFF inhibition.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, treatment with blisibimod was associated with significant improvements in lupus disease activity and lupus biomarkers, including anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, urine protein content, or proteinuria, and complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	Details of the findings of these trials are provided in the Historical Clinical Studies section.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	In subjects with baseline urinary protein excretion equivalent to 1-6 g/24hrs, treatment with blisibimod resulted in significantly greater reductions in proteinuria compared to placebo from Week 8 through Week 24.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Furthermore, the observed treatment-related decreases in proteinuria resulted in near normalization of the proteinuria to 1g/24hrs in those subjects receiving blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Graphs show data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	With its mechanism of BAFF inhibition, blisibimod treatment was associated with significant reductions in the numbers of total B cells, anti-dsDNA antibodies, as well as significant increases in complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Graphs show data for blisibimod (average of all dose levels) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	In addition, we believe blisibimod may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed BAFF antagonist, belimumab, as well as other novel B-cell directed therapies including:
1316175_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Manufacturing and peptibody design: Blisibimod represents a novel molecular structure, which confers manufacturing benefits and lower cost of goods based on a bacterial fermentation manufacturing process; and utilizes multiple binding sites to achieve highest reported affinity for inhibition of BAFF.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	As part of the PEARL-SC clinical study program, patients who completed the study were eligible to enroll in an open label extension study.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	In the OLE study all patients, including those from the placebo arm of the PEARL-SC clinical study receive active therapy for a minimum of 12 months following their final dose in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	We expect to complete dosing in this open label extension study during the first half of 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	Safety and efficacy will be evaluated using key disease biomarkers such as double-stranded DNA, C3, C4 and proteinuria.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P30_S4	Data from this study will be presented during the second half of 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	During the third quarter of 2012 we met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, at an end of phase 2 meeting.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	At the meeting we presented the results of the PEARL-SC clinical study and our plans for Phase 3 registration studies in patients with active lupus who are receiving steroids.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	As a result of this meeting we plan to initiate patient enrollment in our initial Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 clinical study in 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are currently planned to be multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with clinically active SLE (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard-of-care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	Each study will randomize approximately 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo for 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	As agreed with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 studies will be clinical improvement in the SRI-8 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	We plan to conduct periodic interim analyses during the course of the CHABLIS-SC1 study to ensure the accuracy of our estimates.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P32_S4	Following an interim analysis of clinical data from the CHABLIS-SC1 study we plan to initiate patient enrollment in our second Phase 3 clinical study, CHABLIS-SC2.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P32_S5	Based on significant improvements in renal disease biomarkers such as proteinuria, C3 and C4 observed with blisibimod, in 2013 we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss and finalize the enrollment criteria of the CHABLIS-SC2 clinical study in an effort to include patients diagnosed with or without glomerulonephritis.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P32_S6	This revised study design could allow for the incremental inclusion of patients with more significant kidney manifestations of lupus including proteinuria and evidence of renal damage.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	In 2013 we will begin to study blisibimod in patients with B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as IgA nephropathy (Berger s disease).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) IgA nephropathy, an orphan indication is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually in the United States.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	In Asia, a similar prevalence to the U.S. would be estimated to affect over 500,000 people annually.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	In Asia, routine urinalyses are often performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for any patients with asymptomatic hematuria, thus raising the reported prevalence of the disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Immunoglobulin A, or IgA, is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	IgA nephropathy may occur when excessive plasma B-cells express excessive amounts of abnormal IgA and this immunogenic protein is deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	These IgA deposits build up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	According to the New England Journal of Medicine, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Similar to patients with other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, in IgA Nephropathy, elevated levels of BAFF are associated with the proliferation of B-cells and plasma B-cells which may contribute to the disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	In patients with IgAN, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	In IgAN, increased plasma B-cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	Significant reductions in plasma B-cells were observed in previous clinical studies of SLE patients with another BAFF inhibitor antibody, belimumab.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P38_S4	In our PEARL-SC Phase 2b study, significant reductions in total B-cells as well as significant improvements in proteinuria and increases in complement C3 were observed with blisibimod in lupus patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P38_S5	We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce proliferative B-cells and plasma B-cells, reduce serum levels of IgA and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgAN.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	We plan to initiate patient enrollment in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for the treatment of IgA Nephropathy in 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	The BRIGHT-SC study will enroll approximately 48 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN who have proteinuria greater than 1 gram per 24 hours and are receiving standard of care.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	Patients will receive high dose, 300mg weekly, blisibimod or placebo for 8 weeks, during the induction phase, followed by 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	The primary endpoint of the BRIGHT-SC study will be improvements in proteinuria versus placebo after 32 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	We plan to conduct an interim analysis after the eight-week induction phase to determine effects of blisibimod on proteinuria.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P39_S5	In 2013, we will submit an orphan designation application to the FDA for the use of blisibimod as a treatment for IgA nephropathy.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P39_S6	We believe data from the BRIGHT-SC clinical study may provide information for other B-cell mediated kidney orphan diseases such as idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Lupus is an autoimmune disorder that involves inflammation that causes swelling, pain and tissue damage throughout the body.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	Lupus can affect any part of the body, but especially the skin, heart, brain, lungs, joints and the kidneys.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	The course of the disease is unpredictable, with periods of illness, called flares alternating with remission.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	According to the Journal of Arthritis and Rheumatism, the prevalence of lupus is estimated to be between 50-150 per 100,000 in the United States.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	The journal of Arthritis and Rheumatism estimates similar prevalence rates for Europe and Asia.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Although lupus may affect people of either sex, women are 10 times more likely to suffer from the disease than men, according to the Lupus Foundation.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Patients with active lupus may have a broad range of symptoms related to the inflammation.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	Inflammation of the brain may cause seizures and other neurologic abnormalities.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	Inflammation of the heart may cause heart failure or sudden death.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	Lung inflammation causes shortness of breath.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P43_S4	Lupus may also cause swollen joints, proteinuria and severe rash.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P43_S5	In addition, patients with lupus nephritis may require kidney dialysis or eventual transplantation.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production are known to be central to the process.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF plays an important role in this disease process.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P44_S3	In addition, treatment of lupus-prone mice with blisibimod ameliorates the disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	IgA Nephropathy (also known as IgA nephritis or Berger's disease) is a form of glomerulonephritis ( inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidney ) and leading cause of end stage renal disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein, especially aberrant and immunogenic forms of IgA, is deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	These immunogenic IgA immune complexes deposit inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) of signs and symptoms in patients with IgAN is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection or (less commonly) gastrointestinal or urinary infection.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	According to the New England Journal of Medicine, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Men are affected three times as often as women.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgAN throughout the world.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) IgA nephropathy, an orphan disease is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually in the United States.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	In Asia, assuming similar prevalence rates as the United States, IgAN is estimated to affect over 500,000 people annually.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for patients with asymptomatic hematuria, thus raising the reported prevalence of the disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Based on positive results among 104 patients in our Phase 1a and 1b clinical studies, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus patients called PEARL-SC in 2010, exploring three doses of blisibimod for the treatment of patients with seropositive markers of lupus and active disease defined as SELENA-SLEDAI score of greater than 6.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	PEARL-SC was a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b study which enrolled 547 patients in 11 countries at 72 clinical sites.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	Subjects were randomized into three active subcutaneous treatment arms and one placebo treatment arm for a minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	All patients completed the PEARL-SC study when the final enrolled patient completed six months of therapy.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	The primary endpoint of the PEARL-SC study was a clinical improvement at the SLE responder index, or SRI-5, at week 24 for the pooled bisibimod dose groups versus placebo groups.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	SRI-5 is defined as a five-point improvement in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new BILAG A or two BILAG B scores, and no new increase in physician s global assessment of more than 0.3 points.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	Secondary endpoints included safety, improvement in other clinical assessment scores, and clinical response in patients with various baseline disease severities, resolution of fatigue, steroid utilization and time to flare.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	In June and July 2012 we announced results from the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study which we believe support the initiation of a differentiated Phase 3 registration plan utilizing the 200mg weekly dose of blisibimod in patients with active lupus, despite the concomitant use of corticosteroids.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	While the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint in the PEARL-SC clinical study was not met due to a lack of clinical efficacy in the two lower dose groups, additional prospective data from the PEARL-SC study suggest consistent treatment benefits in the 200mg weekly dose group when utilizing higher thresholds of disease improvement, as measured by larger point reductions in the SELENA-SLEDAI scoring index.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition, in a subgroup population of severely ill, seropositive lupus patients, defined as those patients having a SELENA-SLEDAI score of 10 who were also receiving background corticosteroid medication at the time of randomization, a more pronounced treatment benefit was seen with the blisibimod 200mg weekly dose compared to other doses.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Using a higher treatment threshold of an eight point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI, or an SRI-8 endpoint, in this enhanced subgroup population, the 200mg blisibimod treatment group demonstrated a 15.6% treatment difference compared to pooled placebo (41.7% versus 26.1%, p 0.05) and 31.1% treatment difference compare to treatment matched placebo (41.7% versus 10.6%, p 0.001) at 24 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	In this subgroup, which we plan to enroll in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies, separation of clinical response occurred as early as week eight and numerical differences were observed beyond week 24.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	All doses of blisibimod demonstrated consistent serological response including reductions of B-cells, ds-DNA antibodies and improvement in complement levels.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	Additional information and publications from the PEARL-SC clinical study can be found at www.anthera.com/studies_pearl-sc.asp.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Upon completion of PEARL-SC, patients were invited to enroll in an open-label extension study in which patients receive active study drug (blisibimod) for the primary objective of monitoring long-term safety.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	The open-label extension study completed enrollment in 2012 and we anticipate completing patient dosing in this safety and efficacy study in 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	Additional information about the OLE clinical study can be found at www.anthera.com/studies_open-label-extension-study.asp.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	In the third quarter of 2012 at an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we presented the results of the PEARL-SC clinical study and our plans for Phase 3 registration studies in patients with active lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	As a result of this meeting we plan to initiate patient enrollment in the initial Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 study in 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are planned to be multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with clinically active SLE (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard of care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Each study will randomize approximately 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo weekly for 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	As agreed with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 studies will be clinical improvement in the SRI-8 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	We plan to conduct periodic interim analyses during the course of the CHABLIS-SC1 study to ensure the accuracy of our estimates.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Following our initial interim analysis of clinical data from the CHABLIS-SC1 study we plan to initiate patient enrollment in our second Phase 3 clinical study, CHABLIS-SC2.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Similar to patients with other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, in IgA Nephropathy, elevated levels of BAFF are associated with the proliferation of B-cells and plasma B-cells which may contribute to disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	In patients with IgAN, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	In IgAN, increased plasma B-cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	Significant reductions in plasma B-cells were observed in previous clinical studies of SLE patients with another BAFF inhibitor antibody, belimumab.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P60_S4	In our PEARL-SC Phase 2b study, significant reductions in total B-cells as well as significant improvements in proteinuria and increases in complement C3, biomarkers known to be correlated with severity of kidney injury, were observed with blisibimod in SLE patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P60_S5	We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce proliferative B-cells and plasma B-cells, reduce serum levels of IgA and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgAN.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	In 2013 we plan to initiate patient enrollment in BRIGHT-SC, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for the treatment of IgA nephropathy, our first clinical study addressing an orphan indication for the treatment of renal disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	BRIGHT-SC will serve as our initial proof of concept study for an eventual Phase 3 path in renal diseases with blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	The BRIGHT-SC study will enroll approximately 48 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN who have proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours and are receiving standard of care.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P61_S3	Patients will receive high dose, 300mg weekly, blisibimod or placebo for 8 weeks the induction phase, followed by 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo in the maintenance phase.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P61_S4	The primary endpoint of the BRIGHT-SC study will be improvements in proteinuria versus placebo after completion of the maintenance phase of the study, or 32 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P61_S5	We plan to conduct an interim analysis of the BRIGHT-SC clinical results after the eight-week induction phase to determine effects of blisibimod as an induction therapy on proteinuria.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P61_S6	Additional information about the BRIGHT-SC clinical study can be found at www.anthera.com/studies_bright-sc.asp.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	In December 2011, we completed the technology transfer from Amgen Inc., or Amgen and manufacturing scale up to 3,000 liters at our contract manufacturing organization, or CMO (Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices or Fujifilm ).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Two batches of blisibimod produced under U.S. and EU good manufacturing procedures, or GMPs, at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	Data from our first 3,000 liter manufacturing campaign was submitted to the FDA, and product from this batch was released for use in the PEARL-SC and OLE studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch scale volumes and currently have sufficient inventory to support the CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC studies in 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	The product is designed for patient at-home administration and is presented in pre-filled syringes for subcutaneous administration.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	We are actively pursuing various partnerships with major pharmaceutical and biotech companies to develop and commercialize blisibimod for both lupus and additional indications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	The following chart outlines the basic manufacturing steps required for the production of blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Phase 3 program for blisibimod was presented to the European Medicines Agency (EMA, Scientific Advice) in the second quarter of 2012 and to the FDA in the third quarter of 2012 (End-of-Phase 2 meeting).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	The Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC program incorporates feedback and advice obtained from both regulatory agencies.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are planned to be multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with clinically active SLE (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard of care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P66_S3	Each study will randomize approximately 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo for 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	We submitted an application to the FDA in January 2013 requesting orphan designation for the use of blisibimod as a treatment for IgAN.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	We believe data from the BRIGHT-SC clinical study may provide information for other B-cell mediated kidney orphan diseases such as lupus nephritis and idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	In 2014, we anticipate submitting an application to designate blisibimod as a breakthrough therapy in the treatment of IgAN.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	The recent Food and Drug Administration and Innovation Act (FDASIA) provide a number of mechanisms intended to expedite the review and development of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	Prior to our in-licensing of blisibimod, Amgen completed two Phase 1 clinical studies of blisibimod in lupus patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of the drug using intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	The randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1a clinical study evaluated blisibimod as a single intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 56 lupus patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	Intravenous doses included 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	Results from this clinical study indicated the safety and tolerability of blisibimod administered as a single intravenous or subcutaneous dose was comparable to placebo.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Single doses of blisibimod exhibited linear pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	There were comparable adverse events between the blisibimod and placebo groups with no deaths reported.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	In addition, no neutralization antibodies were seen across all doses.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	The most common adverse events were nausea (15%), headache (10%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%) and diarrhea (8%).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Blisibimod was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study as an intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 63 lupus patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	The intravenous dose was 6 mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	Patients received their doses of blisibimod or placebo once-weekly for four weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S3	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S4	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod after multiple doses.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S5	Results showed that multiple doses of blisibimod exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S6	Further, results demonstrated a significant decrease in total B-cells as early as 15 days of treatment, and total B-cell reduction (up to approximately 60-70% of baseline) reached its nadir after about 160 days of therapy.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S7	By six months after treatment, the B-cell populations had returned to baseline levels.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P74_S8	Further analyses of B cell subsets found that na ve B cells and activated B cells were significantly decreased while memory B cells were transiently significantly increased following treatment with blisibimod, consistent with a correction of the B cell abnormalities reported in lupus patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	There were no deaths reported between the blisibimod and placebo groups.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Few neutralization antibodies were seen, and all resolved in subsequent visits.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	Based on these results and published data from competitor studies, we conducted a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating blisibimod in lupus patients from the second half of 2010 to the third quarter of 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Two of our former product candidates, varespladib and varespladib sodium, were designed to inhibit a novel enzyme target known as secretory phospholipase A 2 , or sPLA 2 .
1316175_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Elevated levels of sPLA 2 have been implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as in chronic diseases, including stable coronary artery disease, or CAD.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	In March 2012, an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended stopping the VISTA-16 clinical study for varespladib due to a lack of efficacy that could not be reasonably overcome in the remainder of the trial.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	The study was prematurely terminated by the DSMB because of the inability of VISTA-16 to detect a statistically significant benefit of the drug on the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints even if the trial continued to its scheduled termination with the proposed expanded sample size.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	The same data reviewed by the DSMB were subsequently brought in-house and examined by a committee of medical and drug safety professionals.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	In addition to reviewing the primary endpoint data, this review included an unblinded review of demographics, baseline characteristics, laboratory results, concomitant medications, treatment emergent adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	No obvious clinical or scientific reason has been found for the increased hazard for non-fatal myocardial infarction amongst subjects treated with varespladib despite positive treatment-related changes in LDL-C and CRP.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	At the time of study termination the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint (time to first occurrence of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or documented unstable angina with objective evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization) was 1.244 (p=0.155).
1316175_13_ITEM1_P81_S2	This is primarily driven by the increased occurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction, a single component of the composite primary endpoint: HR 1.686 p=0.009.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P81_S3	Additional details about the VISTA-16 study can be found at www.anthera.com/studies_vista-16.asp.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	In connection with the termination of varespladib and varespladib sodium, we implemented an organizational restructuring plan in 2012 that lowered operating expenses through headcount reductions and the elimination of certain vendor activities.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	We modified work orders with key vendors to ensure efficient wind-down activities, while still maintaining patient safety as a top priority.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	We have reallocated our remaining resources to other potential development programs and product portfolio efforts.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P82_S3	Based on the recommendation of the DSMB, we do not expect to engage in any further development activities of varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P82_S4	Therefore, we provided notice of termination to the collaborators in August 2012 to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P82_S5	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including autoimmune diseases.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	We are advancing the development of blisibimod to exploit the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	We have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2b clinical studies with blisibimod in lupus patients and plan to advance blisibimod into a Phase 3 registration program in 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P84_S2	We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of this compound in lupus or in other B-cell mediated diseases, such as IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and others that may benefit from BAFF antagonism, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	Orphan indications in renal diseases represent a substantial untapped opportunity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	We intend to build an orphan path upon the secondary data we collected from our Phase 2b PEARL-SC study and recently published renal effects of Benlysta.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	The data will help us select an appropriate orphan path to supplement our approach in lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	We believe that this orphan approach will further differentiate blisibimod from other anti-BAFF molecules in a capital-efficient manner.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	The progression of patients with IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis to end stage renal disease poses a considerable cost and societal burden.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	We believe improvement in patient outcomes will allow for premium orphan pricing for blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, we believe successful outcomes in the BRIGHT-SC study will support future lifecycle expansion for blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P86_S3	Furthermore, disease-specific dosing regimens may enable product commercialization at substantially different price points.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	Developing Commercial Strategies Designed to Maximize Our Product Candidates Market Potential.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our primary product candidate is focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as rheumatologists and nephrologists.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	In other chronic indications, we intend to seek commercial collaborations with companies that have a large, dedicated sales force focused on general practitioners and we plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P90_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidate obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P90_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P90_S4	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Benlysta (belimumab) was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	It is the first novel therapy approved in the last 50 years.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	Current therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants generally act to hold back broadly the proliferation of many types of cells, including white blood cells.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	However, use of these agents is associated with significant adverse events and broad immune suppression.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Several new biological agents under development have targeted BAFF (or BLyS) and other B-cell related pathways for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	These product candidates include Benlysta (belimumab) from Human Genome Sciences, Inc., tabalumab (LY2127399) from Eli Lilly and Company, atacicept, or TACI-Ig, from ZymoGenetics Inc. and epratuzumab from Immunomedics, Inc., as well as others acting via non B-cell mechanisms, such as Lupuzor from Cephalon.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P93_S2	We believe that blisibimod may offer potential differentiation from these agents, including demonstrated dosing flexibility with both subcutaneous and intravenous delivery; selective modulation and reduction of relevant B-cell types in lupus patients; the ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF; the use of a bacterial expression platform which is expected to translate to lower manufacturing costs compared with therapeutic antibodies; and distinct patent protection based on a novel and proprietary technology developed and commercialized by Amgen.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	As of the date of this report, our blisibimod patent portfolio includes:
1316175_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	Eleven pending non-EP foreign patent applications in Brazil, Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Serbia, Montenegro and Slovakia.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Amgen to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	In addition, we hold a non-exclusive worldwide license to one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, one pending EP patent application, 14 non-EP foreign patents, and over 40 pending non-EP foreign patent applications relating to general peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022 and November 2023.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P101_S2	This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to May 2027 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P101_S3	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P101_S4	The European patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P101_S5	One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P102_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P102_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	We are aware of two families of third party United States patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P105_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P105_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P105_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing blisibimod, as well as the right to grant sublicenses.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P107_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P107_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P108_S1	Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than blisibimod that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	We paid a first installment fee of $3.0 million and a second installment fee of $3.0 million.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P109_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States, European Union or Japan.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P109_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P109_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P109_S4	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	The license agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P110_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company or Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd., pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license in all countries except for Japan to certain technology and compounds relating to sPLA 2 inhibitors.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P112_S1	The licensed technology was largely developed under a research and development agreement between Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd., which was entered into between the parties in August 1992 and terminated in December 2004.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive rights to (i) use licensed patent rights and know-how to identify and develop sPLA 2 inhibitors, (ii) develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell licensed compounds and pharmaceutical formulations thereof, including varespladib, varespladib sodium, A-003 and other sPLA 2 inhibitors and (iii) grant sublicenses.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P113_S1	The licensed patent rights include a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P113_S2	Certain patents and applications within the licensed patent rights are defined as core patents.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P113_S3	Although the agreement does not allow us to sell or offer for sale licensed products in Japan, it does allow us to conduct preclinical and clinical studies in Japan in support of applications for marketing authorization outside of Japan, and to make and have made licensed products in Japan for use or sale outside of Japan.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P113_S4	Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd. retain the right to use licensed products for research purposes only.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P113_S5	Eli Lilly also retains the right to conduct studies of specific compounds in animals for research purposes, but only with our prior written approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P113_S6	In addition, Shionogi Co., Ltd. retains the non-exclusive right to make and have made licensed products for supply to us, as well as its rights to continue research, development and marketing of licensed technology in Japan.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P114_S0	Upon entering into the license agreement, we assumed control of all prosecution and maintenance of core patents prosecuted and maintained by Eli Lilly prior to the agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P114_S1	All core patents prosecuted and maintained by Shionogi Co., Ltd. prior to the agreement remained under the control of Shionogi Co., Ltd. Licensed patent rights that were not classified as core remained under the control of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P114_S2	However, control of certain of these patents and applications has since been transferred to us following the decision by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd. to discontinue prosecution and maintenance.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P115_S0	Upon entering into the license agreement, we made one-time payments of cash in the amount of $250,000 and issued shares of convertible preferred stock with a total aggregate value of $2.3 million to Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P115_S1	Based on the recommendation of the DSMB in March 2012 to terminate the VISTA-16 study of varespladib, we do not expect to engage in any further development activities of our sPLA 2 portfolio, including varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P115_S2	Therefore, we do not expect to incur further payments to our collaborators.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P115_S3	In August 2012, we provided notice of termination to Eli Lilly to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P115_S4	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012 and U.S. Investigational New Drug application, or IND was withdrawn in January 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P116_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP ) with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P116_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidate if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P116_S2	Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P117_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P117_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P117_S2	In order to commercialize our product candidate, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P117_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidate alone.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P117_S4	In therapeutic areas that require a large sales force selling to a large and diverse prescribing population, we currently plan to partner with third parties to commercialize our product candidate while retaining rights to co-promote our products to a select audience of high prescribing physicians in the United States, thereby supplementing or enhancing the efforts of a commercial partner.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P117_S5	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P118_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidate to market alone or in collaboration with a co-development or co-promotion partner.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P118_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P118_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P119_S0	Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P119_S1	Our product candidate must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process, and our biological product candidate, blisibimod, must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P120_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P120_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P120_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P120_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P121_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_13_ITEM1_P122_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P123_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidate will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P124_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P124_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P124_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P124_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P125_S0	Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P125_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P125_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P125_S3	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P126_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P126_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P126_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P126_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P126_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P127_S0	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P127_S1	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P128_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_13_ITEM1_P129_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P129_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P130_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P131_S0	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P131_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P132_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P132_S1	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P132_S2	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P132_S3	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P133_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P133_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things; the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P133_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P134_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P134_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P135_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P135_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P135_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P136_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P136_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P136_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P136_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P137_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P137_S1	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P137_S2	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P138_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P138_S1	The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P138_S2	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P138_S3	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P138_S4	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P139_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P139_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P139_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P139_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P139_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P139_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P139_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P140_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P140_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P140_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P141_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P141_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P141_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P141_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P141_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P141_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P141_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P142_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S6	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P143_S7	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P144_S0	HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P144_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P144_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P145_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P145_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P145_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P145_S3	The current pediatric exclusivity provision was reauthorized in September 2007.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P146_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P146_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P146_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P146_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P147_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P147_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P147_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P147_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P148_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P148_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P149_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P149_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P150_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P150_S1	Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P151_S0	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P151_S1	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P152_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P152_S1	A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P152_S2	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P152_S3	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P153_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P153_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P153_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P154_S0	The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) includes a provision that allows sponsors to request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P155_S0	The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with 1 or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on 1 or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P155_S1	The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P156_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P157_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P157_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P157_S2	Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P157_S3	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P158_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P158_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P158_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P159_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P159_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P160_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P160_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P161_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P161_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P161_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P162_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P163_S0	Failure to comply with any requirements under the new law may result in significant penalties.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P163_S1	The new law also authorizes significant civil money penalties for the dissemination of false or misleading direct-to-consumer advertisements and allows the FDA to require companies to submit direct-to-consumer television drug advertisements for FDA review prior to public dissemination.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P163_S2	Additionally, the new law expands the clinical study registry so that sponsors of all clinical studies, except for Phase 1 clinical studies, are required to submit certain clinical study information for inclusion in the clinical study registry data bank.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P164_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P164_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P165_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P165_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P165_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P165_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P166_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P166_S1	European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P167_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P167_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P167_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P168_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P168_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P168_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P168_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P168_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S3	However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S6	Our product candidate may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S7	It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P169_S8	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P170_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P170_S1	For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P170_S2	Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P170_S3	Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P170_S4	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P170_S5	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P170_S6	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P171_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P171_S1	Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P171_S2	Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P171_S3	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P171_S4	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P171_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P171_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P172_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P172_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P172_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P172_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P173_S0	There are also laws that govern a company s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P173_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company s ability to operate its business.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P174_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P174_S1	We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P174_S2	Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P174_S3	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P174_S4	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P174_S5	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P175_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P176_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidate and operate profitably.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P177_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P178_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P178_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P178_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P178_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P178_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P178_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P179_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had 23 employees.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P179_S1	All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P179_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P180_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P180_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC, which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P180_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P181_S0	The mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_13_ITEM1_P182_S0	Through a link on the Investors section of our website (under SEC Filings in the Financial Information section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this report.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We are a development stage company with only eight years of operating history.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have focused primarily on developing our three product candidates, blisibimod, varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The two latter product candidates were terminated in March 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have financed our operations exclusively through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, and debt financings and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in September 2004.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $260.4 million.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Substantially all of our losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We expect to incur additional losses over the next several years, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate revenues.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have never generated any revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct preclinical tests in animals and clinical studies in human beings, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidate and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We have not generated any revenue from our development-stage product candidate, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidate will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidate in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our product candidate is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Currently, we have one product candidate in clinical development, which is blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Blisibimod could fail in clinical studies if we are unable to demonstrate that it is effective or if it causes unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Failure of our product candidate in clinical studies would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidate or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our drug discovery efforts may not produce any other viable or marketable product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Even if our product candidate is approved for commercial sale, the approved product candidate may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Physicians, patients, payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend our product.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Even if we are able to generate product sales, which we cannot guarantee, we may not achieve profitability soon thereafter, if ever.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are unable to generate product revenues, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without additional funding.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our future capital requirements could be substantial and will depend on many factors including:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	revenues received from approved products, if any, in the future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of the date of this report, we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	terminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidate or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidate, if approved for sale.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to Amgen Inc. is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Pursuant to our license agreement with Amgen, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to Amgen is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of blisibimod, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, conducting product development activities for our primary product candidates, blisibimod, varespladib and varespladib sodium (the two latter product candidates were terminated in March 2012), and performing research and development.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our product candidate which is still under clinical development.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot assure you that our product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidate successfully.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our lead product candidate blisibimod has completed several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In July 2010, we received clearance from the FDA to begin recruitment of lupus patients into the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In November 2010, we placed a voluntary hold on the PEARL-SC study due to problems found with vials.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Patient enrollment in the study was temporarily suspended and dosing was discontinued in patients who were enrolled in the study while we conducted an analysis of the problem.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We resolved the issues found with the vials in December 2010.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	After analysis, simulation and consultation with industry experts, we determined that shipping on dry ice was the root cause of the issue.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Shipping logistics were modified and we reinitiated enrollment in PEARL-SC and dosing in January 2011.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We have received no reports of patient-related side effects or problems with drug administration that could be attributed to the vial problem.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	SLE response index and to include an option for an interim efficacy analysis.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The trial was completed and results were announced during 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our product candidate is prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidate may not:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are not permitted to market blisibimod our product candidate in the United States until we receive approval of a biologics license application, or BLA, from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We have not submitted a BLA or received marketing approval for our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	The FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidate could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, while an independent statistician had completed an analysis of various biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and determined that treatment with once-daily varespladib met the pre-specified criteria for the VISTA-16 study to proceed, an independent DSMB reviewing the clinical data from the VISTA-16 study recommended the clinical study be discontinued due to a lack of efficacy that could not be overcome in the remainder of the trial.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Product development costs to us and our collaborators will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidate or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delaying factors outside our control.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, blisibimod or any other product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidate, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for our product candidate may be adversely impacted.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidate has performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain FDA approval for our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we breach the license agreement for our primary product candidate, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our primary product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are party to an agreement with Amgen containing exclusive, worldwide licenses of the composition of matter and methods of use for blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The agreement requires us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify Amgen under the terms of the agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensor may terminate our exclusive license and may be able to re-obtain licensed technology and aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us that relate to the licensed technology that originated from the licensor.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our licensor could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of blisibimod after an uncured, material breach of our license agreement by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the license could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidate may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidate obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidate is likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The market for inflammatory disease therapeutics is especially large and competitive.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	For lupus, Human Genome Sciences, Inc. s and GlaxoSmithKline plc s BAFF antagonist monoclonal antibody, Benlysta, was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Further, we are aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of lupus, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Merck Serono S.A., whose dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist fusion protein, Atacicept, is in a Phase 3 clinical study for lupus; and Immunomedics, Inc. and UCB S.A., who recently reported favorable results for their CD-22 antagonist humanized antibody, epratuzumab, which completed a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus and has begun a Phase 3 study, and Eli Lilly s anti-BLYS monoclonal antibody, LY2127399, which has begun two Phase 3 studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our product candidate obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P44_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our product candidate may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidate could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Phase 2 clinical studies conducted by us with our product candidate have generated differences in adverse effects and serious adverse events.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The most common adverse effects seen with any of our product candidates versus placebo include diarrhea, headache, nausea and increases in alanine aminotransferase, which is an enzyme that indicates liver cell injury.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The most common serious adverse events seen with any of our product candidates include death, VOC and congestive heart failure.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	A Phase 3 clinical study conducted by us with our terminated product candidate varespladib has generated differences in adverse effects and serious adverse events.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S5	In the VISTA-16 clinical study the most common adverse effects seen included cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and other nervous system and respiratory disorders.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S6	There were more cardiovascular events in the varespladib arm of this study versus the placebo (117 versus 95, p=0.113).
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S7	This finding was driven by a significantly higher occurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction in those patients treated with varespladib compared to those treated with placebo.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S8	While none of these serious adverse events were considered related to the administration of our product candidates by the clinical investigators, if serious adverse events that are considered related to our product candidate is observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate may be adversely impacted.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P46_S9	Further, if our product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our product could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidate and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize our product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate we develop.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and FDA regulatory review.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Even if our product candidate receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our product candidate will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P52_S4	If we, our product candidate or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidate fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product and generate revenue.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	New legal and regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain approvals for our product candidate and could limit or make more burdensome our ability to commercialize any approved products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	New federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidate or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	For example, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, granted the FDA new authority to impose post-approval clinical study requirements, require safety-related changes to product labeling and require the adoption of risk management plans, referred to in the legislation as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The REMS may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals, and restrictions on distribution and use.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Pursuant to the FDAAA, if the FDA makes the requisite findings, it might require that a new product be used only by physicians with specified specialized training, only in specified designated health care settings, or only in conjunction with special patient testing and monitoring.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	The legislation also included the following: requirements for providing the public information on ongoing clinical studies through a clinical study registry and for disclosing clinical study results to the public through such registry; renewed requirements for conducting clinical studies to generate information on the use of products in pediatric patients; and substantial new penalties, for example, for false or misleading consumer advertisements.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Other proposals have been made to impose additional requirements on drug approvals, further expand post-approval requirements, and restrict sales and promotional activities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P56_S6	The new legislation, and the additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidate, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	If our product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval does not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The commercial success of our product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of the product by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	If our product candidate is approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from the product, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third- party payors on the benefits of our product candidate may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Paul F. Truex, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Colin Hislop, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer and the other principal members of our executive team.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P62_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Also in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P68_S3	As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P68_S4	These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third- party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, the Health Care Reform Law and additional prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P70_S4	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P70_S5	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the European Union and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The use of our product candidate in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P74_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	decreased demand for our product candidate, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	If and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidate, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P79_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P79_S3	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P82_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidate may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P82_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P82_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of our approved product candidate may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidate if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P84_S2	If we are unable to arrange for third- party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidate or market them.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidate ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidate in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidate be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of our product candidate in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In December 2011, we completed the technology transfer from Amgen and manufacturing scale up to 3,000 liters at our contract manufacturing organization, or CRO (Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices or Fujifilm ).
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Two (2) batches of blisibimod produced under FDA good manufacturing procedures, or GMP, at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We submitted plans to the FDA on March 4, 2011 and September 9, 2011 establishing criteria to demonstrate comparability of blisibimod manufactured by Fujifilm to that manufactured by Amgen.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Data confirming comparability to Phase 1 material (Amgen) was filed with the FDA on August 8, 2011 and September 8, 2011.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P86_S4	In September 2012, we received comments from the FDA on the submissions listed above.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P86_S5	The FDA agreed that the material manufactured by Fujifilm was comparable to that previous manufactured by Amgen.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidate for our clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P87_S1	There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P87_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P87_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P87_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidate, the commercial launch of our product candidate would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidate, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If we successfully commercialize any of our drugs, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P88_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P88_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, the satisfaction of which on a timely basis may not be met.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidate, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P90_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P90_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P92_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P92_S3	For example, organizations like the American Heart Association have made recommendations about therapies in the cardiovascular therapeutics market.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	If our or our licensors patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidate or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	As of the date of this report, we hold license rights to numerous U.S. EP, and non-EP foreign patents and patent applications for blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Our blisibimod portfolio includes exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen, Inc.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We also own several U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications relating to our terminated varespladib sodium/varespladib programs.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	These patents and patent applications include both patents and patent applications originally filed by Anthera and patents assigned to Anthera by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Our varespladib sodium/varespladib portfolio previously included a larger set of patents and patent applications relating to sPLA 2 inhibiting compounds and exclusively licensed from Eli Lilly Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P95_S3	In August 2012, we provided notice of termination to our collaborators to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P95_S4	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P95_S5	Due to termination of the varespladib programs, we do not expect to incur further payments to our collaborators under the license agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidate and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P96_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidate and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P99_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidate and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	We are aware of two families of third party United States patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P102_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P102_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P102_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P102_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P104_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P104_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P104_S3	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P104_S4	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P104_S5	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P104_S6	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P105_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the novel BAFF inhibitor blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P106_S1	We previously had obtained exclusive, worldwide licenses, except for Japan, of the composition of matter, methods of making and methods of use for certain sPLA 2 compounds from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P106_S2	In August 2012, we provided notice of termination to our collaborators to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P106_S3	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P106_S4	Due to termination of the varespladib programs, we do not expect to incur further payments to our collaborators under the license agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P106_S5	We may enter into additional licenses to third- party intellectual property in the future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering our blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P107_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P107_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P107_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P107_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P107_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P108_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P108_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P109_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and to obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in the regulatory approval process.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Assuming we gain a five-year patent term extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2027 or 2028.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Assuming we gain such a five-year extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s European new chemical entity patents until 2027.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S2	Further, since blisibimod has not been previously approved, blisibimod could be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity from the FDA.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S3	During the data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S4	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small molecule compound or biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that compound or biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S5	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S6	However, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P111_S7	If we fail to receive such Hatch-Waxman extensions or marketing exclusivity rights or if we receive extensions that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P112_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We typically develop our product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P113_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of these product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P113_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P114_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell any of our product candidate or proposed product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P114_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P115_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P115_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P115_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P115_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P118_S1	If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing our product candidate to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidate and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidate, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P119_S3	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors existing or future patents.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidate or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P121_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P122_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P122_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidate to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidate or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Our common stock is currently at risk for delisting from NASDAQ in June 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Our common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, or NASDAQ.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P124_S1	NASDAQ has minimum requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on NASDAQ.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P124_S2	These requirements include maintaining a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P125_S0	On December 20, 2012, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Global Stock Market informing us that for the last 30 consecutive business days the bid price of our common stock has closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P125_S1	The letter stated that Nasdaq will provide the Company a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until June 18, 2013, to regain compliance.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P125_S2	To regain compliance, any time before June 18, 2013, the bid price of our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P126_S0	If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P126_S1	In addition, if delisted we would no longer be subject to NASDAQ rules, including rules requiring us to have a certain number of independent directors and to meet other corporate governance standards.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P126_S2	Our failure to be listed on NASDAQ or another established securities market would have a material adverse effect on the value of your investment in us.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P127_S0	If our common stock is not listed on NASDAQ or another national exchange, the trading price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share and we have net tangible assets of $6,000,000 or less, the open-market trading of our common stock will be subject to the penny stock rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P127_S1	If our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P127_S2	Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P128_S0	obtain a signed and dated acknowledgement from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before a transaction in a penny stock can be completed.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P129_S0	As a result of these requirements, the market price of our securities may be adversely impacted, and current stockholders may find it more difficult to sell our securities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P131_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P132_S0	discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P133_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P133_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P133_S5	These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P134_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P134_S1	We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P134_S2	Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention from our business.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Because a small number of our existing stockholders own a majority of our voting stock, your ability to influence corporate matters will be limited.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P136_S1	As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P136_S2	These persons will also have the ability to control our management and business affairs.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P136_S3	This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P138_S0	As of December 31 2011 and December 2012, there were 40,933,354 and 79,151,592, shares respectively, of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P138_S1	In January 2013, we issued 60,606,061 shares at an initial closing of a public offering, followed by a second closing of 9,090,909 shares in February 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P138_S2	In addition, as of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock, restricted stock units and warrants of 7,440,521 that, if exercised or released, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P138_S3	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P138_S4	Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P138_S5	Moreover, certain holders of shares of common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P139_S0	We have registered all common stock that we may issue under our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan ) and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P139_S1	As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of 3,386,379 shares of our common stock has been reserved for future issuance under the 2010 Plan, plus any shares reserved and unissued or cancelled under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, and an aggregate of 600,000 shares has been reserved for future issuance under our ESPP.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P139_S2	These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P139_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P140_S0	We filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179043) on January 17, 2012, which was declared effective on January 24, 2012, for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P140_S1	In July 2012, we issued 37,950,000 shares at $1.00 per share pursuant to the shelf registration, raising net proceeds of approximately $35.6 million.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P140_S2	In January 2013, we issued 60,606,061 shares at $0.66 per share pursuant to the shelf registration at an initial closing of a public offering, followed by 9,090,909 at a second closing in February 2013, raising net proceeds of approximately $43.0 million.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P141_S0	On November 8, 2012, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Agreement ) with MLV Co.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P141_S1	LLC ( MLV ), to create an at-the-market equity program under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25 million (the Shares ) through MLV, as agent.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P141_S2	We have not sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the Agreement, which was terminated effective January 24, 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P141_S3	This facility is no longer available for use.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P143_S0	We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P143_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P144_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P146_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P146_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P146_S2	For example, the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P146_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P147_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P147_S1	We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P147_S2	In 2012, our independent registered public accounting firm was not required to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reports due to the exemptions allowed to small companies as part of the Investor Protection Act.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P147_S3	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P147_S4	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P149_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P149_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P149_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P152_S0	the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P153_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P153_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P153_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards will be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P155_S1	An ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P155_S2	We incurred an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 ownership of the Internal Revenue Code during 2012 and as such, our net operating loss carryforward are limited.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P155_S3	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_13_ITEM1A_P155_S4	If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We occupied 7,800 square feet under a sublease that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2008 and was then amended in April 2011.
1316175_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	The new lease commenced on August 1, 2011 and includes approximately $245,000 in tenant improvement reimbursements from the landlord.
1316175_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	Pursuant to the amendment, the lease increased the Company s square footage from 7,800 square feet to approximately 14,000 square feet.
1316175_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	The new lease expires on September 30, 2014.
1316175_13_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not subject to any material pending legal proceedings.
1316175_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol ANTH since our initial public offering ( IPO ).
1316175_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that offering, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Market:
1316175_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of 79,151,592 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by approximately 53 holders of record and beneficial holders, based on information provided by the Company s transfer agent.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	In January 2013, we issued 60,606,061 shares of our common stock at an initial closing of a public offering, followed by a second closing of 9,090,909 shares in February 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	A significantly larger number of stockholders may be "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Nasdaq Biotech Index from March 1, 2010 (the first day our stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market through December 31, 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on March 1, 2010 in each of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Biotech Index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The past performance of our common stock is no indication of future performance.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P5_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III of this report.
1316175_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	All information under this Item has been previously reported on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
1316175_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	We did not repurchase any securities during the quarter ended December 31, 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our Phase 3 ready product candidate, blisibimod, targets elevated levels of B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including system lupus erythematosus (SLE), or lupus, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and others.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Blisibimod is a peptibody antagonist of the BAFF cytokine that is initially being developed as a treatment for lupus.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	BLyS, also known as B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of B-cells.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	It is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The BAFF-R receptor is expressed primarily on peripheral B-cells.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We intend to advance the clinical development of our BAFF inhibitor, blisibimod, to exploit its broad potential clinical utility in a number of autoimmune diseases.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture versus antibodies that are produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages including ease of manufacture and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have worldwide rights to blisibimod in all potential indications.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	In June and July 2012, we announced results from our Phase 2b PEARL-SC clinical study in patients with SLE.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	In September 2012, we completed the End of Phase 2 discussions with the FDA and announced our intention to advance blisibimod into Phase 3 clinical trials for patients with SLE.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are planned to be multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with clinically active SLE (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard-of-care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Each study will randomize approximately 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo for 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	As agreed with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 studies will be clinical improvement in the SRI-8 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	We plan to conduct periodic interim analyses during the course of the CHABLIS-SC1 study to ensure the accuracy of our estimates.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Following our initial interim analysis of clinical data from the CHABLIS-SC1 study we plan to initiate patient enrollment in our second Phase 3 clinical study, CHABLIS-SC2.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Results from the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study that was completed in 2012 showed a statistically significant treatment reduction in proteinuria in both the pooled blisibimod treatment group and the 200mg weekly blisibimod treatment group.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Following the encouraging results from the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study, we plan to initiate patient enrollment in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (BRIGHT-SC) in 2013, our first orphan indication for the treatment renal disease and will serve as our initial catalyst for a Phase 3 path in renal diseases with blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The BRIGHT-SC study will enroll approximately 48 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN who have proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours and are receiving standard of care.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Patients will receive high dose blisibimod or placebo for 8 weeks, the induction phase, followed by 24 weeks, the maintenance phase, of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	The primary endpoint of the BRIGHT-SC study will be improvements in proteinuria versus placebo after 32 weeks.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	We plan to conduct an interim analysis after the eight-week induction phase to determine effects of blisibimod on proteinuria.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Two of our former product candidates, varespladib and varespladib sodium, were designed to inhibit a novel enzyme target known as secretory phospholipase A2, or sPLA 2 .
1316175_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Elevated levels of sPLA 2 have been implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory conditions, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, as well as in chronic diseases, including stable coronary artery disease.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	In March 2012, an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended stopping our VISTA-16 clinical study for varespladib due to a lack of efficacy that could not be reasonably overcome in the remainder of the trial.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The study was prematurely terminated by the DSMB because of the inability of VISTA-16 to detect a statistically significant benefit of the drug on the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints even if the trial continued to its scheduled termination with the proposed expanded sample size.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The same data reviewed by the DSMB were subsequently brought in-house and examined by a committee of medical and drug safety professionals.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition to reviewing the primary endpoint data, this review included unblinded review of demographics, baseline characteristics, laboratory results, concomitant medications, treatment emergent adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs).
1316175_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	No obvious clinical or scientific reason has been found for the increased hazard for non-fatal myocardial infarction amongst subjects treated with varespladib despite positive treatment-related changes in LDL-C and CRP.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	At the time of study termination the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint (time to first occurrence of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or documented unstable angina with objective evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization) was 1.244 (p=0.155).
1316175_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	This is primarily driven by the increased occurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction, a single component of the composite primary endpoint: HR 1.686 p=0.009.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	In connection with the termination of varespladib and varespladib sodium, we implemented an organizational restructuring plan in 2012 that lowered operating expenses through headcount reductions and the elimination of certain vendor activities.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We modified work orders with key vendors to ensure wind-down activities were efficient, while still maintaining patient safety as a top priority.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	We have reallocated our remaining resources to other potential development programs and product portfolio efforts.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Based on the recommendation of the DSMB, we do not expect to engage in any further development activities of varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	Therefore, we provided notice of termination to the collaborators in August 2012 to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We were incorporated and commenced operations in September 2004.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Since our inception, we have generated significant losses.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $260.4 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	In January 2012, Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The establishment of this subsidiary was part of the Company s ongoing growth activities and strategic plan.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	As of the date of this filing, we have never generated any revenue and have generated only interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	We expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt and debt financings, raising net proceeds of approximately $260.0 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	In addition to the normal risks associated with development-stage companies, we may never successfully complete development of any of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	We do not expect to generate revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize our product candidate or in-license additional products that generate revenue.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	We intend to seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales, up-front fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships and royalties resulting from the licensing of the commercial rights to our intellectual property.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the nature, timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized, as well as any revenue we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidate development programs.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: licensing, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for the continued development of blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	We are developing our product candidates in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project, but rather are allocated across our clinical stage programs.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for 2012, 2011, and 2010, and for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2012 (in thousands):
1316175_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Includes milestone payments of $3.5 million pursuant to amendments to the license agreements with each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co. Ltd., which were paid in the form of shares of common stock.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Includes license fees of $4.0 million pursuant to a license agreement with each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co. Ltd., which were paid in cash and shares of preferred stock in 2006.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Includes a one-time license initiation fee of $6.0 million pursuant to a license agreement with Amgen.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	We intend to fund our clinical studies with existing cash and proceeds from potential future debt and equity offerings.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	As we obtain results from clinical studies, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Completion of clinical studies may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	The cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including:
1316175_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones such as number of patients enrolled.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P33_S5	If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	None of our product candidates have received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions, including clinical, chemical manufacturing, regulatory, finance and business development.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	We make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	The majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We base our accruals related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Research and development expenses decreased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to decreased clinical trial costs of approximately $24.6 million associated with our Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib as a direct result of the termination of the VISTA-16 study in March 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Furthermore, manufacturing activities for our Phase 2 clinical study of blisibimod was substantially completed by December 2011 and all patients completed dosing by June 2012, which also contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses by approximately $10.8 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	General and administrative expenses decreased in 2012 to 2011 primarily due to lower legal cost associated with patent prosecution of varespladib as a result of the termination of the VISTA-16 study in March 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Furthermore, we reduced our spending on consulting and professional services in line with the termination of the varespladib program.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Other expense recorded in 2012 is a result of net loss realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Other income recorded in 2011 was primarily due to realized gain on our short-term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Interest expense in 2012 included 12 months of interest recognized on our notes payable to Hercules Technology II, L.P and Hercules Growth Capital (together, Hercules ) as compared to only 9 months of interest recognized in 2011 because notes were issued in March 2011.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Research and development expenses increased from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to increased clinical trial costs associated with our Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib and Phase 2 clinical study of blisibimod of approximately $41.2 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The trial costs increased as a result of continued enrollment and the addition of clinical sites for the VISTA-16 and PEARL-SC clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Manufacturing development activities also increased by approximately $13.9 million as compared to the prior period.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	We also increased headcount to support our clinical development activities in 2011, which resulted in increased salaries and benefits of $2.0 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	General and administrative expenses increased from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to increased headcount and professional services incurred in connection with our financial audit and other costs associated with operating as a public company.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Other income increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily as a result of higher cash and investment balances in 2011 as compared to the prior year due to proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable and equity offering.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Further included in 2011 were realized foreign currency gains of approximately $0.4 million on short-term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Interest expense increased in 2011 from 2010 was primarily due to 9 months of interest recognized on our notes payable to Hercules.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	Interest expense for 2010 consisted of primarily non-cash charges related to the amortization of discounts associated with our convertible promissory notes issued in July and September of 2009, which were converted into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO in March 2010.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt, debt financings, and our IPO raising net proceeds of approximately $303.0 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $24.7 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following (in millions):
1316175_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, and our capital expenditure needs.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	We filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179043) on January 17, 2012, which was declared effective on January 24, 2012, for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	In July 2012, we issued 37,950,000 shares at $1.00 per share pursuant to the shelf registration, raising net proceeds of approximately $35.6 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	In January 2013, we issued 60,606,061 shares at $0.66 per share in an initial closing of a public offering, followed by 9,090,909 shares in a second closing in February 2013, raising net proceeds of approximately $43.0 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	We may issue securities in the future based on market conditions or other circumstances.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	On November 8, 2012, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Agreement ) with MLV Co.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	LLC ( MLV ), to create an at-the-market equity program under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25,000,000 (the Shares ) through MLV, as agent.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	We have not sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the Agreement, which was terminated January 24, 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	This facility is no longer available for use.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cash flow from continued operations during the years ended December 21, 2012 and 2011 consist of the following (in millions):
1316175_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	During the years ended 2012 and 2011, our operating activities used cash of $73.6 million and $73.1 million, respectively, primarily resulting from our net losses and changes in our working capital accounts.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase in cash used in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to payments made in the current year against the prior year s payable balances.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	During the year ended 2012, cash used in investing activities was $3.8 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	During the year ended 2011, cash provided by investing activities was $20.2 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of short term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	During the year ended 2012, financing activities provided cash of $31.3 million, which was primarily derived from proceeds received from our public offering of common stock in July 2012 from which we raised a total of $35.6 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, offset by principal payment of $4.5 million against Hercules notes payable.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended 2011 was $78.4 million, derived from a public offering of common stock in June 2011 from which we received net proceeds of $54.0 million and issuance of notes payable to Hercules in March 2011 from which we received net proceeds of $24.7 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Cash flow from continued operations during the years ended December 21, 2011 and 2010 consist of the following (in millions):
1316175_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	During the years ended 2011 and 2010, our operating activities used cash of $73.1 million and $27.8 million, respectively, primarily resulting from our net losses and changes in our working capital accounts.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase in cash used in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due increased clinical trial costs associated with our Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib and Phase 2 clinical study of blisibimod.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	During the year ended 2011, our investing activities provided cash of $20.2 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	During the year ended 2010, cash used in investing activities was $23.4 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our investing activities are consisted of primarily purchases and maturities of short term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	During the year ended 2011, financing activities provided cash of 78.4 million, derived from a public offering of common stock in June 2011 from which we received net proceeds of $54.0 million and issuance of notes payable to Hercules in March 2011 from which we received net proceeds of $24.7 million.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended 2010 was $87.5 million, derived from our IPO of common stock in March 2010 from which we received proceeds of $61.2 million and $29.6 million from the issuance of common stock and warrants in connection with the private placement offering in September, and proceeds of approximately $0.2 million received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock through our ESPP, offset by approximately $3.5 million of issuance cost paid during 2010.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	We have lease obligations consisting of an operating lease our operating facility that expires September 2014, for office space, and office equipment lease that expires in June 2013.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	On March 25, 2011, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement ( Loan Agreement ) with Hercules.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, we borrowed $25.0 million at an interest rate of the higher of (i) 10.55% or (ii) 7.30% plus the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal, and issued to Hercules a secured term promissory note evidencing the loan.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	The loan is secured by our assets, excluding intellectual property.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	We made interest only payments for the initial 15 months from April 2011 to June 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P67_S4	Thereafter, the loan is being repaid in 30 equal monthly installments of approximately $1.0 million, at the initial interest rate.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P67_S5	We will be obligated to pay an end of the term charge of $0.9 million, which is being expensed over the term of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest rate.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table summarizes our estimated scheduled future minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):
1316175_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Interest payments reflected are estimated based on an interest rate of 10.55% throughout the term of the note, plus an additional end of term charge of $937,500.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidates in development, as these payments are not determinable.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Under our license agreement with Amgen to develop and commercialize blisibimod, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable on a country-by-country basis and licensed on a product-by-licensed-product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicensee in such country, or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidate into clinical studies and as we:
1316175_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	implement new operational, financial and management information systems.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	the acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of the date of this report, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to conduct additional or extended clinical studies and seek regulatory approval of our product candidate.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidate, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities, if convertible, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to terminate, significantly modify or delay our development programs, reduce our planned commercialization efforts, or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1316175_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1316175_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
1316175_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
1316175_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, since a majority of our investments are in short-term certificates of deposit, FDIC-insured corporate bonds and money market funds, we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure.
1316175_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we did not have any material derivative financial instruments.
1316175_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our marketable securities, including those included in cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $24.7 million as of December 31, 2012.
1316175_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities.
1316175_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary.
1316175_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this item are set forth beginning in Item 15 of this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management performed, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process, effected by an entity s board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures which pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management s and/or the Board of Directors authorization; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material errors in our financial statements.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with our policies and procedures may deteriorate.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, using the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based on our assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.
1316175_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P4_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_13_ITEM15_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P5_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P5_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P6_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P7_S0	In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, and for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company or Anthera ) was incorporated on September 9, 2004 in the state of Delaware.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	Anthera is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	The Company s primary product candidate, blisibimod, targets elevated levels of B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and others.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	In January 2012, Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Company s activities since inception have consisted principally of acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital, and performing research and development.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development stage as of December 31, 2012, as defined by guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ).
1316175_13_ITEM15_P19_S2	Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets; secure financing; develop a customer base; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and develop strategic alliances.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P19_S3	To date, we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt and debt financings, raising net proceeds of approximately $303 million.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	From September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2012, the Company had an accumulated a deficit of $260.4 million.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	During 2012, the Company incurred a net loss of $59.4 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $73.6 million.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P21_S2	The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations over the next several years during its clinical development phase.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	To fully execute its business plan, the Company will need to complete certain research and development activities and clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	Further, the Company s product candidate will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P22_S2	These activities may span many years and require substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P22_S3	Any delays in completing these activities could adversely impact the Company.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	The Company plans to meet its capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities (see Note 16 for discussion of the January 2013 issuance of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $43.0 million), debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical accounting policies or estimates related to clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash currencies, for which the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company has designated its investments as available for sale and the investment are carried at fair value.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	Securities with maturity exceeding three months but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P27_S3	Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on specific identification method and are reported in the statements of operations.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P27_S4	The Company includes any unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1316175_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	The Company s cash equivalents consist of certificates of deposit with maturities less than three months and treasury money market funds.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P28_S2	The Company s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with maturities exceeding three months but less than one year.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P28_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P28_S4	The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to five years, using the straight-line method.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the life of the related asset, whichever is shorter.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company s long-lived assets and other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	Through December 31, 2012, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company makes estimates of its accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known at that time.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on the Company s behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	The majority of service providers invoice at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	The Company periodically confirms the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and makes adjustments if necessary.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P35_S3	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Accruals related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on the Company s behalf.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P37_S2	Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	In accruing service fees, the Company estimates the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expensed in each period.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from estimates, the accrual is adjusted accordingly.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	If costs are not identified or if the Company underestimates or overestimates the level of services performed or the costs of these services, actual expenses could differ from estimates.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development, and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with product formulation and chemical analysis.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company charges research and development costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	Clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P41_S2	All of the Company s clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P41_S3	The Company accrues costs for clinical studies performed by CROs based on patient enrollment activities and adjusts the estimates, if required, based upon the Company s ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P41_S4	The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the CROs, and adjusts the estimates, if required, on a monthly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended by each CRO.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	All material CRO contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and the Company is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain noncancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Amounts paid in advance related to incomplete services will be refunded if a contract is terminated.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	Some contracts include additional termination payments that become due and payable if the Company terminates the contract.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	Such additional termination payments are only recorded if a contract is terminated.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	In 2010, research and development costs were offset by $1 million of grant monies received for certain research and development costs as provided by Section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Comprehensive loss consists of certain changes in equity that is excluded from net loss.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	Specifically, the Company includes unrealized losses on available for sale securities and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash equivalents and short-term investments in other comprehensive loss.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	Comprehensive loss for each period presented is set forth in the Statement of Comprehensive Loss.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company operates in only one segment.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P48_S4	The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	Diluted EPS is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s calculation of net loss per common share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):
1316175_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	The following table shows weighted-average historical dilutive common share equivalents outstanding, which are not included in the above calculation, as the effect of their inclusion is anti-dilutive during each period.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial statements over the employees requisite service period.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	Compensation costs related to all equity instruments granted after January 1, 2006 are recognized at the grant-date fair value of the awards.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	Additionally, the Company is required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	Expected Term The Company s expected term represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Expected Volatility Expected volatility is estimated using comparable public company volatility for similar terms.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has never paid dividends and has no plans to pay dividends.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing method is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	The estimated forfeiture rate is determined based on the Company s historical forfeiture rates to date.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company monitors actual expenses and periodically updates the estimate.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with guidance provided by the FASB and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and recognized as expense over the related service period.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company s cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company s cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2011 were as follows (in thousands):
1316175_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	Realized losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were immaterial.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P63_S3	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
1316175_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and readily accessible by us at the reporting date.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs are cost method investments, auction rate securities (ARS) and the Primary Fund.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	The following tables present the Company s fair value hierarchy for all its financial assets (including those in cash and cash equivalents), in thousands, by major security type measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):

1316175_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	The lease is for approximately 14,000 square feet and expires on September 30, 2014.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	The Company recognizes rental expense on the facility on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P72_S3	Differences between the straight-line net expense on rent payments is classified as deferred rent liability and included in the accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Rent expense was as follows (in thousands):
1316175_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	As of December 31, 2012, future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1316175_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	In December 2007, the Company with Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement (the Amgen Agreement ) to develop and commercialize blisibimod in any indication, including for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ).
1316175_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company paid a nonrefundable, upfront license fee of $6.0 million.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	As there is no future alternative use for the technology, the Company expensed the license fee in research and development expenses during 2007.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company is obligated to make additional milestone payments to Amgen of up to $33.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company is also obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the high single digits to the low double digits, which are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	The Company s royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P76_S3	As of December 31, 2012, there were no outstanding obligations due to Amgen.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P77_S5	Based on the recommendation of the DSMB in March 2012 to terminate the VISTA-16 study of varespladib, the Company does not expect it will engage in any further development activities of its sPLA 2 portfolio, including varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P77_S6	Therefore, the Company does not expect to incur further payments to its collaborators.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P78_S4	Thereafter, the loan is being repaid in 30 equal monthly installments of approximately $952,000, at the initial interest rate.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P78_S5	The Company is also obligated to pay an end of the term charge of $937,500, which is being expensed over the term of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest method.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company applied the relative fair value method to allocate the $25.0 million proceeds received under the Loan Agreement between the loan and warrant.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The initial carrying amount assigned to the loan was $23.7 million and was recorded as Notes payable net of discount on the Company s balance sheet.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	We believe the carrying amount at December 31, 2012 approximates fair value.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P80_S3	The fair value allocated to the warrant of $1.3 million was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the Company s balance sheet.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P80_S4	The resulting $1.3 million discount from the $25.0 million par value of the loan is being amortized as an additional interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P124_S2	Because of the Company s recent history of operating losses, management believes that the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits are currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P124_S3	The net valuation allowance decreased by $38.3 million in 2012, increased by $39.2 million and $15.5 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively, and $42.6 million for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2012.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company incurred a Section 382 ownership change in 2012 and as such, the Company's net operating loss carryforwards have been limited.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P127_S1	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P127_S2	As a result of the Section 382 limitation, a significant portion of the Company s net operating losses and R D credits (deferred tax assets) have been written off.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.5 million, all of which would not currently affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company s deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P163_S0	1 The Executive may elect in advance to defer the receipt of some or all of his Base Annual Salary and/or Annual Bonus (collectively, the Eligible Compensation ) from the Company.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P163_S2	Any election under this paragraph shall apply only to Eligible Compensation that is earned with respect to services to be performed on or after the start of the next calendar year beginning after the Company receives and accepts such election.

1316175_13_ITEM15_P163_S4	The Executive may revoke his deferral election with respect to Eligible Compensation that is payable in the next calendar year beginning after receipt and acceptance by the Company of his written revocation.
1316175_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	No later than 30 days after the Effective Date, the Executive may file a deferral election applicable to Eligible Compensation that is otherwise payable for services performed in 2013, but such election may only relate to Eligible Compensation that will be earned with respect to services to be performed subsequent to the election (the Initial Election ).

1316175_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Unless the context otherwise requires, we use the terms Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Anthera, we, us, the Company and our in this report to refer to Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We use various trademarks, service marks and trade names in our business, including without limitation Anthera Pharmaceuticals and Anthera.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	This report also contains trademarks, services marks and trade names of other businesses that are the property of their respective holders.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our Phase 3 candidate, blisibimod, targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, (lupus), Immunoglobin A nephropathy (IgA nephropathy), lupus nephritis, vasculitis and others.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	Elevated BAFF is also reported in hematological diseases such as multiple myeloma and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in September 2004.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	In January 2012, Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	BAFF, also known as BLyS, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell lineages as well as plasma cells.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Abnormal elevations in BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	Based on data from our Phase 2b clinical study, we intend to advance the clinical development of our BAFF inhibitor, blisibimod, to exploit its potential clinical utility in a number of autoimmune diseases.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	We have worldwide rights to blisibimod for all potential indications.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	In 2012, we completed the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Lupus patients suffer from a chronic autoimmune disease, where an inappropriate or abnormal immune response often leads to severe skin rash, fatigue, joint pain, ulceration, major kidney complications, including proteinuria, and cardiovascular disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Inhibition of BAFF is believed to reduce survival of B-cells and plasma cells and autoantibodies, leading to a reduction in severity of disease and resolution of lupus symptoms.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our product development program is focused on development of blisibimod for use as a therapeutic treatment for lupus and other serious autoimmune diseases for which we believe current treatments are either inadequate or non-existent.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our current plan includes continuing the ongoing CHABLIS-SC1 clinical study in patients with active lupus and the BRIGHT-SC1 clinical study in patients with IgA nephropathy, and evaluating the potential of blisibimod in additional autoimmune and hematological diseases through clinical and nonclinical investigations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch scale quantities.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	The blisibimod product is designed for at-home, self-administration and is presented as a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	We are actively pursuing various partnerships with major pharmaceutical and biotech companies to develop and commercialize blisibimod for both lupus and IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We are currently evaluating additional plans for the development of blisibimod as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	These indications provide multiple commercial potentials for blisibimod and may provide an accelerated and cost-efficient path to regulatory approval and commercialization.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	We believe that certain of these markets and product opportunities for blisibimod can be commercialized through utilization of a limited specialty sales force targeting a small set of clinical specialists.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	In addition, we believe blisibimod may address market opportunities in chronic indications such as lupus and to maximize these opportunities we may seek development and commercialization partners to address non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Blisibimod (also referred to as A-623) is a peptibody antagonist of the BAFF cytokine, also known as B-cell activating factor, which was initially developed as treatment for patients with severe systemic lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	BAFF, also known as BLyS, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of B-cells and plasma cells.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	B-cells represent a critical component of a human immune response to infection and other pathogens.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	However, abnormal elevations of B-cells and plasma cells, often accompanied by elevations in BAFF, may lead to an overactive immune response, including an increased production of immunogloblulins, which may damage normal healthy tissues and organ systems.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production from plasma cells are known to be central to the process.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF plays an important role in these disease processes.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	In preclinical studies in mice that develop lupus-like disease, BAFF is known to be elevated, and treatment with blisibimod improves outcomes and survival.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P19_S4	Similarly, in IgA nephropathy, mice that over-express BAFF develop a fatal nephropathy associated with elevated Immunoglobulin A, or IgA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	According to the Alliance for Lupus Research, it is estimated that up to 1.5 million people have lupus in the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Lupus Europe estimates that one in 750 women suffer from lupus in Europe and that lupus is a worldwide disease more common in some races than others.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	IgA nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis throughout the world.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The prevalence of IgA nephropathy varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan and China), Australia, Finland and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulonephritis).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	To date, four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two Phase 1 dose-ranging studies in which a total of 104 patients were enrolled, a Phase 2b double-blind placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical outcomes study in which 547 subjects were enrolled, and a Phase 2 Open-Label Extension study (OLE) which evaluated the long-term safety of blisibimod in subjects previously enrolled in the Phase 2b PEARL-SC trial.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	As expected for a BAFF inhibitor, statistically significant reductions in total B-cells were observed in patients treated with blisibimod compared with placebo in all three of the placebo-controlled studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Based on positive results among 104 lupus patients in our licensor s Phase 1a and 1b clinical studies, we conducted PEARL-SC, a Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various subcutaneous doses of blisibimod in patients with seropositive lupus and active disease defined as SELENA-SLEDAI 6 at enrollment, which ran from mid-2010 to April 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	The study enrolled 547 patients in 11 countries at 72 clinical sites.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	All patients completed the PEARL-SC study when the final enrolled patient completed six months of therapy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	In June and July of 2012 we announced results from the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study, which we believe support the initiation of a differentiated Phase 3 registration plan utilizing a 200mg weekly dose of blisibimod in patients with active lupus, despite the concomitant use of corticosteroids.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The primary endpoint of the PEARL-SC study was a clinical improvement at the lupus responder index, or SRI-5, at week 24 for the pooled blisibimod dose groups versus placebo groups.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	SRI-5 is defined as a five-point improvement in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new BILAG 1A or 2B scores, and no new increase in Physician s Global Assessment of more than 0.3 points.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	The primary endpoint of this study was not met due to the lack of efficacy in the two lowest dose groups.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	However, the primary endpoint SRI-5 responder rates were numerically higher in subjects receiving blisibimod 200mg weekly (QW) compared with pooled placebo, from Week 16 ( SRI 5 for blisibimod-placebo=8%, p= 0.14), through Week 24 ( SRI 5=8.2%, p=0.15), reaching statistical significance at Week 20 ( SRI 5=13.4%, p = 0.02, Figure 1).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	Treatment benefit was greater still when compared with the regimen-matched (QW) placebo.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P25_S5	In pre-specified secondary analyses, benefit was observed at Week 24 with the 200mg QW group compared with matched placebo using modified SRI analyses in which responders attained SELENA-SLEDAI improvements of 7 or 8 ( SRI 5 = 8.7% p=0.23; SRI-7 =16.3% p=0.003; SRI-8 =17.4% p=0.001, Figure 1).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P25_S6	Blisibimod was also effective in a subgroup of patients with severe lupus with baseline SELENA-SLEDAI 10 and receiving corticosteroids at any dose (n=278) utilizing more stringent response thresholds ( SRI-5=13.8%, p=0.18; SRI-7=28.9%, p=0.002; SRI-8=31.1%, p 0.001, Figure 2 and Table 1).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Based on SELENA SLEDAI definitions, 76 subjects (13.9%) had renal involvement at baseline and 54 subjects had proteinuria equivalent 1g/24hr.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Compared with baseline, decreases in proteinuria were observed with blisibimod from Week 12 through Week 52 in the subgroup of subjects with proteinuria equivalent 1 g/24hr at enrollment (Figure 3).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Similarly, decreases in proteinuria were observed in subjects with proteinuria equivalent 0.5 g/24hr through Week 44.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	Significantly greater reductions in proteinuria were also observed in a subgroup of subjects with active inflammation (ie low C3) and high anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) (Figure 3).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Secondary endpoints included safety, improvements in variant forms of the SRI (e.g. defined by greater improvements in SELENA-SLEDAI), effects on clinical response in subgroup of patients with greater baseline disease severities, time to lupus disease flare, improvements in proteinuria, improvements in biomarkers of inflammation (e.g. anti-dsDNA, complement C3 and C4), and changes in B-cell counts.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	In June of 2012 we completed dosing in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Using a higher treatment threshold of an eight-point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI, or an SRI-8 endpoint, in this enhanced subgroup population, the 200mg blisibimod treatment group demonstrated a 15.6% treatment difference compared to pooled placebo (41.7% versus 26.1%, p 0.05) and 31.1% treatment difference compare to regimen-matched placebo (41.7% versus 10.6%, p 0.001) at 24 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	In this severe subgroup, separation of clinical response was evident as early as Week 8 and numerical improvements relative to placebo were maintained beyond Week 24.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	This severe subgroup is the population that we believe will benefit most from treatment with blisibimod, and is the population whom we are enrolling in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	Significant and early decreases in proteinuria were also observed with blisibimod as early as Week 8 in subjects with baseline proteinuria equivalent 1g/24 hrs.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P29_S4	All doses of blisibimod demonstrated consistent serological response including reductions of B-cells, double-stranded-DNA antibodies and improvement in complement levels.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P29_S5	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P29_S6	Additional information and publications from the PEARL-SC clinical study can be found at www.anthera.com/studies_pearl-sc.htm.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, Washington DC, 2012 in Figure 1, an SRI-5 responder achieved all of the following: 5 point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, and no new BILAG 1A or 2B organ domain scores, and no worsening ( 0.3 increase) in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	Across all subjects enrolled in the PEARL-SC study, the percent of subjects achieving the SRI-5 at 24 weeks was higher in subjects receiving the highest dose of blisibimod (200mg QW) compared with placebo.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	SRI improvements compared with placebo were generally higher in subjects who attained SELENA SLEDAI improvements of 6, 7, 8 (SRI-6, SRI-7 and SRI-8, respectively).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Graphs show data for blisibimod (200mg QW) and treatment matched or pooled placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, Washington DC, 2012 in Figure 2, a n SRI-5 responder achieved all of the following: 5 point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, and no new BILAG 1A or 2B organ domain scores, and no worsening ( 0.3 increase) in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	In a subgroup analysis of patients with severe lupus disease (SELENA SLEDAI 10 and receiving steroid at baseline, n=278), the percent of subjects achieving the SRI-5 was higher in subjects receiving the highest dose of blisibimod (200mg QW) compared with placebo.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	SRI improvements compared with placebo were higher still in subjects who attained SELENA SLEDAI improvements of 6, 7, 8 (SRI-6, SRI-7 and SRI-8, respectively).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	Graph shows data for blisibimod (200mg QW) and regimen matched placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Analyses were conducted in the subgroup of subjects with more severe lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI score 10) at enrollment.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	SLE Responder Index (SRI) is defined as patients who respond to treatment and achieve a reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI equal to or greater than the number indicated, no new BILAG 1A or 2B organ domain scores, and no increase in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of greater than 0.3 on a three point scale.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	In subjects with baseline urinary protein excretion equivalent to 1-6g/24hrs, treatment with blisibimod resulted in significantly greater reductions in proteinuria compared to placebo from Week 8 through Week 24.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Furthermore, the observed treatment-related decreases in proteinuria resulted in near normalization of the proteinuria to 1g/24hrs in those subjects receiving blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Graphs show data from subgroups of patients defined by baseline proteinuria for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Separately, data are shown for the subgroup of subjects with high inflammatory biomarker status at enrollment, defined by low C3 and high anti-dsDNA autoantibodies at baseline.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	Data are plotted for all pooled blisibimod dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P36_S3	See data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the European League Against Rheumatology Annual Conference, Madrid, Spain 2013 in Figure 3.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	In this study, statistically significant reductions in total B-cells were observed in patients treated with blisibimod compared with placebo due to its mechanism of BAFF inhibition.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	In addition, treatment with blisibimod was associated with significant improvements in lupus disease activity and lupus biomarkers, including anti-dsDNA antibodies, proteinuria, immunoglobulins including IgG and IgM, and complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated in this study, with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events or infections compared with placebo (see Table 2 in the next section).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	In order to evaluate longer-term safety of blisibimod, patients with lupus who completed the PEARL-SC study were able to participate in an OLE study in which they were treated with active drug (blisibimod).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	The OLE study was opened in Q2 2012 and closed in Q2 2013 after subjects had completed a minimum of one year of continuous therapy with blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	Interim data from the combined PEARL-SC and OLE studies were presented at the 2013 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology and Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ACR/ARHP).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, a case report was published summarizing observations in a patient who was randomized to placebo in the PEARL-SC study then experienced a rapid improvement in serum cryoglobulins upon initiation of blisibimod therapy in the OLE study (Golima et al., Rheumatology , 2013).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The emerging data for the OLE study corroborate the effects of 24-week therapy with blisibimod observed in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	Specifically, the improvements in proteinuria observed in the subgroup of patients with abnormal proteinuria at enrollment (Figure 4), were maintained over 52 weeks of continuous blisibimod therapy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	In addition, the effects observed with blisibimod on peripheral B-cells, anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, and complement C3 and C4 and immunoglobulins IgG and IgM observed over 24 weeks of dosing in the PEARL-SC study were found to be durable over 52 weeks of therapy through the OLE study (Figures 5 and 6).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P39_S3	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels through the PEARL-SC and OLE studies, with no associated increase in risk of severe infection (Table 2).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	The data from the Phase 2 program with blisibimod support the ongoing exploration of blisibimod s efficacy and safety in the Phase 3 study in patients with lupus (CHABLIS-SC1) as well as the Phase 2 study in patients with IgA nephropathy (BRIGHT-SC1).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Additional information for the OLE clinical studies can be found at www.anthera.com /studies_open-label-extension-study.htm.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego 2013, in Figure 4, the significant improvements in proteinuria in patients with lupus randomized to blisibimod compared with placebo observed in the PEARL-SC study were found to be durable through their continuing exposure to blisibimod in the OLE study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Graphs show data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial, and interim data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego 2013 in Figure 5, w ith its mechanism of BAFF inhibition, blisibimod treatment was associated with significant reductions in the numbers of total B-cells, anti-dsDNA antibodies, as well as significant increases in complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Graphs show data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial, and interim data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego 2013 in Figure 6, s ignificant reductions in immunoglobulins IgG and IgM were observed with blisibimod compared with placebo during the placebo-controlled PEARL-SC study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	These effects were found to be durable in subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	The effects on immunoglobulins were not associated with infection risk, nor were alterations in white blood cells, monocytes, or neutrophils associated with blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	Graphs show data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial, and interim data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	In the third quarter of 2012 at an End of Phase 2 meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we presented the results of the PEARL-SC clinical study and our plans for Phase 3 registration studies in patients with active lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	As a result of this meeting we initiated patient enrollment in the initial Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 (Figure 7) study in March 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with seropositive, clinically active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who continue to have active disease despite stable corticosteroid therapy for treatment of their disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Each study plans to randomize up to 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo for 52 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	As agreed with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 studies will be clinical improvement in the SRI-8 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	We believe the CHABLIS development program for blisibimod may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed BAFF antagonist and other novel B-cell directed therapies, including:
1316175_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Manufacturing and peptibody design: Blisibimod represents a novel molecular structure, which confers manufacturing benefits and lower cost of goods based on a bacterial fermentation manufacturing process and utilizes multiple binding sites to achieve highest reported affinity for inhibition of BAFF.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	A futility analysis of clinical study is planned to be conducted by an independent unblinded statistician in mid-2014 after a minimum of 100 subjects have completed 24 weeks of treatment to confirm the clinical and commercial assumptions of the design of this study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	This futility analysis is not intended to provide any rules for stopping for overwhelming efficacy, change in study sample size, or alteration of the study design.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Enrollment rates for the CHABLIS-SC1 study have exceeded our initial expectations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	An independent DSMB will convene to review the study at the end of March 2014 and mid-July 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We enrolled more than 100 patients prior to the end of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	Continuing enrollment of the full 400 patients into the CHABLIS-SC1 trial is contingent on a positive outcome from this interim analysis.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	Regardless of the outcome of the interim analysis, all patients randomized into the CHABLIS-SC1 study will be allowed to complete the full 52 weeks of blinded treatment to provide additional safety and efficacy data for future regulatory filings for other potential indications for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	In addition to serving as a registration study for a potential lupus indication, we plan to include safety data from CHABLIS-SC1 in a potential IgA nephropathy marketing application for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P50_S4	Additional information for the CHABLIS-SC1 clinical studies can be found at www.anthera.com/studies_chablis-sc1.htm.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Following recent input from the FDA, we submitted a second pivotal study, CHABLIS-SC2, to the FDA in the first quarter of 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	This study is planned to enroll patients with clinical diagnosis of lupus with or without renal disease, including patients with glomerulonephritis and patients who may have had a previous diagnosis of lupus nephritis.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	It is anticipated that these two CHABLIS studies, along with long-term safety observations from the CHABLIS-Open-Label Extension Study will form the basis of approval for blisibimod as a treatment for lupus patients with active disease despite the use of steroids.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	We intend to study blisibimod in B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as IgA nephropathy (Berger s disease).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	According to the National Organization of Rare Disease, or NORD, IgA nephropathy, an orphan indication, is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually in the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	In Asia, a similar prevalence to the United States would be estimated to affect over 500,000 people annually.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	In Asia, routine urinalyses are often performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for any patients with asymptomatic hematuria, thus raising the reported prevalence of the disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	IgA nephropathy may occur when plasma B-cells express excessive amounts of abnormal IgA and immune complexes containing this immunogenic protein are deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	These IgA deposits build up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	According to a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (Wyatt Julian, 2013), primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Data for the cumulative renal survival rate observed from the time of renal biopsy until a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease in 1,012 patients with IgA Nephopathy (Presented by Moriyama and colleagues at the American Society of Nephrology, 2013).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Similar to patients with other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, in IgA nephropathy, elevated levels of BAFF are associated with disease activity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	In patients with IgA nephropathy, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	In IgA nephropathy, increased plasma B-cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Significant reductions in plasma B-cells were observed in previous clinical studies of patients with lupus with another BAFF inhibitor antibody, belimumab.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	In our PEARL-SC Phase 2b study, significant reductions in total B-cells as well as significant improvements in proteinuria and increases in complement C3 were observed with blisibimod in lupus patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce proliferative B-cells and plasma B-cells, reduce serum levels of IgA and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	The BRIGHT-SC1 study (Figure 10) is a Phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Initially we intend to enroll up to 48 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy who have proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr) and are receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	We initiated our BRIGHT-SC1 study in the second quarter of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Patients will receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	When the first 48 patients have completed eight weeks of treatment we plan to conduct an interim analysis to determine the effect of blisibimod on proteinuria and other relevant renal biomarkers such as IgA and IgG levels.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	In May 2013, we met with the FDA to discuss the blisibimod development program for IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	As a result of feedback from the FDA on the potential use proteinuria as the endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod, we have amended the BRIGHT-SC study endpoints during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	The amendment serves to both transform BRIGHT-SC1 into a pivotal Phase 3 study and adjust its endpoints to paitents achieving less than 1 gram of proteinuria per 24 hours at 24 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	Upon implementation of this new amendment it is our intention to use the BRIGHT-SC study as one of two studies necessary to support the marketing approval of blisibimod for the treatment of IgA nephropathy under the accelerated approval pathway (FDA Subpart E).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P64_S4	In addition, the FDA indicated a requirement for us to provide confirmatory data from a post-marketing study which would include measurement of clinical endpoints, such as changes in kidney function, progression to dialysis and death in patients previously enrolled in the two registration studies and a third outcomes study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P64_S5	Additional information about the BRIGHT-SC clinical study can be found at www.anthera.com/studies_bright-sc.htm.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	In June 2013, we met with the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, to discuss the development of blisibimod for the treatment of IgA nephropathy in Japan.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	At this initial meeting, the PMDA agreed to consider a change in proteinuria as the basis for an initial approval of blisibimod for the treatment of IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	Additional discussions with the PMDA regarding development of blisibimod in Japan are planned for the second quarter of 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	In December 2013, we submitted an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products of the FDA for the investigation of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	This submission incorporated feedback from both the initial meetings with the FDA and PMDA and included a second clinical study protocol, BRILLIANT-SC1.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	We intend to study blisibimod in B-cell mediated hematologic diseases such as multiple myeloma.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	According to the NORD, multiple myeloma is a rare disease that afflicted an estimated 21,700 new individuals in the United States in 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	Approximately 100,000 patients are believed to have multiple myeloma in the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Multiple myeloma is associated with over-production and altered function of cancerous forms of plasma cells in the bone marrow.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	The disease presentation often includes bone pain, elevated calcium in the blood, anemia, clotting disorders and a loss of function of the immune system with a resulting increase in infection risk.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Multiple myeloma typically presents during the 4th to 7th decades of a patient s life and has a median survival rate of 2-4 years for patients with Stage II - III disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	BAFF is known to be elevated in patients with multiple myeloma, and the BCMA receptor (or B-cell Maturation Antigen receptor) which binds to BAFF and a proliferation-inducing ligand (or APRIL) and increases survival of plasma cells is also expressed on multiple myeloma cells.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	It is therefore not surprising that survival of patient-derived multiple myeloma cells is decreased in the presence of a BAFF inhibitor when administered on its own or in combination with steroid or lenalidomide.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	Furthermore, in an animal model of disease induced by human multiple myeloma cells, BAFF inhibition was found to increase survival and decrease disease-associated bone lesions.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	In a recently completed, open-label, Phase 1 trial the BAFF inhibitor tabalumab was associated with a 55% increase in overall response rate in patients with multiple myeloma with a concomitant decrease in immunoglobulins secreted form multiple myeloma cells (called M proteins).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2014 to evaluate the effects of blisibimod on survival, progression, and biomarkers in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with at least one prior regimen.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	Additionally, we plan to seek advice on our clinical development plans in multiple myeloma with the Division of Hematology Products of the FDA in mid-2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Lupus is an autoimmune disorder that involves inflammation that causes swelling, pain and tissue damage throughout the body.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Lupus can affect any part of the body, but especially the skin, heart, brain, lungs, joints and kidneys.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	The course of the disease is unpredictable, with periods of illness, called flares, alternating with remission.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S3	Although lupus may affect people of either sex, women are 10 times more likely to suffer from the disease than men, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S4	The Alliance for Lupus Research reports up to 1.5 million people have lupus in the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S5	It is estimated that approximately 10% of people with lupus are treated in the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S6	These patients are further categorized into three disease categories ranging from mild, moderate, to severe.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P74_S7	Based on the results from our PERAL SC study, we believe patients in the moderate to severe disease categories, which approximate 30,000 to 40,000, are likely to benefit most from treatment with blisibimod and this is the population whom we are enrolling in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies..
1316175_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Lupus Europe estimates that one in 750 women in Europe suffer from lupus and that lupus is a worldwide disease more common in some races than others.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Patients with active lupus may have a broad range of symptoms related to the inflammation.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	Inflammation of the brain may cause seizures and other neurologic abnormalities.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Inflammation of the heart may cause heart failure or sudden death.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	Lung inflammation may cause shortness of breath.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P76_S4	Lupus may also cause swollen joints, proteinuria and severe rash.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P76_S5	In addition, patients with lupus nephritis may require kidney dialysis or eventual transplantation.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production are known to be central to the process.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF plays an important role in this disease process.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	In addition, treatment of lupus-prone mice with blisibimod ameliorates the disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	IgA nephropathy (also known as IgA nephritis or Berger's disease) is a form of glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidney) and a principal cause of end-stage renal disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein, especially aberrant and immunogenic forms of IgA, is deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	These immunogenic IgA immune complexes deposit inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	The classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) of signs and symptoms in patients with IgA nephropathy is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection or (less commonly) gastrointestinal or urinary infection.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	According to NORD, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	Men are affected three times as often as women.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	In the United States, IgA nephropathy is considered an orphan disease as it is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually, although this number might prove to be higher with more robust screening.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for patients with asymptomatic hematuria and the reported prevalence of the disease is much higher.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P82_S3	For example, in Japan, IgA nephropathy is estimated to affect over 350,000 people annually.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	According to NORD, multiple myeloma is a rare disease that afflicted an estimated 21,700 new individuals in the US in 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	Approximately 100,000 patients are believed to have multiple myeloma in the US.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	Multiple myeloma is associated with over-production and altered function of cancerous forms of plasma cells in the bone marrow.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	The disease presentation often includes bone pain, elevated calcium in the blood, anemia, clotting disorders, and a loss of function of the immune system with a resulting increase in infection risk.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Multiple myeloma typically presents in during the 4th to 7th decades of a patient s life and has a median survival rate of 2-4 years for patients with Stage II - III disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	In December 2011, we completed the manufacturing site transfer from Amgen Inc., or Amgen, to our contract manufacturing organization, or CMO (Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices, or Fujifilm).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	We also scaled up manufacturing from 300 liters up to 3,000 liters.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	Two batches of blisibimod produced under U.S. and EU good manufacturing procedures, or GMPs, at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P87_S3	Data from our first 3,000 liter manufacturing campaign was submitted to the FDA and product from this batch was released for use in the PEARL-SC and OLE studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch scale volumes to support the CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC1 studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	Additionally, in late 2013, we initiated activities for large-scale purification of our next batch of blisibimod with Fujifilim.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	Final product from this product manufacturing campaign is expected to provide sufficient placebo and blisibimod syringes for completion of the CHABLIS-SC1 clinical study and the initiation of the second pivotal clinical study in patients with lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P88_S3	Furthermore, we plan to develop an auto injector strategy for the product presentation at launch in 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Phase 3 program for blisibimod was presented to the European Medicines Agency (EMA, Scientific Advice) in the second quarter of 2012, to the FDA in the third quarter of 2012 (End-of-Phase 2 meeting) and to the FDA in a follow-up advice procedure in the third quarter of 2013 (Type C request to which the FDA provided written responses in lieu of a meeting).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	The Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC program incorporates feedback and advice obtained from both regulatory agencies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are planned to be multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies of similar design intended to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with clinically active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard of care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P89_S3	The second Phase 3 study, CHABLIS SC-2, includes modifications to enrich for the enrollment of patients with lupus and nephritis.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P89_S4	Each study plans to randomize approximately 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo for 52 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P89_S5	The statistical analysis plan for CHALIS SC-1 has been amended to reflect advice received from the FDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P89_S6	Amended CHALIS-SC1 and CHABLIS SC-2 protocols were submitted to the FDA in the first quarter of 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	An Investigational New Drug application, or IND, submitted to the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products of the FDA for the investigation of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy, is now in effect.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	This IND incorporated feedback from both the initial meetings with the FDA and PMDA and included a second clinical study protocol, BRILLIANT-SC1.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	The meeting with the FDA in May 2013 focused on the choice of primary endpoints for an approval in the post-marketing setting.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P90_S3	Among the discussion points with the FDA and later with the PMDA was the use of a substantial reduction in proteinuria to establish the efficacy of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P90_S4	Additional feedback from FDA on the IgA nephropathy program is anticipated in the second quarter of 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P90_S5	Further discussion of the proteinuria endpoint, as well as the inclusion of Japan in a global harmonized program of studies in IgA nephropathy will take place at the PMDA in April 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	We anticipate submitting an application to designate blisibimod as a breakthrough therapy in the treatment of IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	The recent Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) provide a number of mechanisms intended to expedite the review and development of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	Prior to our in-licensing of blisibimod, our licensor, Amgen, completed two Phase 1 clinical studies of blisibimod in lupus patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of the drug using intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	The randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1a clinical study evaluated blisibimod as a single intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 56 lupus patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	Intravenous doses included 1, 3 and 6mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3mg/kg.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	Results from this clinical study indicated the safety and tolerability of blisibimod administered as a single intravenous or subcutaneous dose was comparable to placebo.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	Single doses of blisibimod exhibited linear pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	There were comparable adverse events between the blisibimod and placebo groups with no deaths reported.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	In addition, no neutralization antibodies were seen across all doses.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	The most common adverse events were nausea (15%), headache (10%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%) and diarrhea (8%).
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Blisibimod was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study as an intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 63 lupus patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	The intravenous dose was 6mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S2	Patients received their doses of blisibimod or placebo once-weekly for four weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S3	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S4	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod after multiple doses.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S5	Results showed that multiple doses of blisibimod exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S6	Further, results demonstrated a significant decrease in total B-cells as early as 15 days after beginning treatment, and total B-cell reduction (up to approximately 60-70% of baseline) reached its nadir after about 160 days of therapy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S7	By six months after beginning treatment, the B-cell populations had returned to baseline levels.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P97_S8	Further analyses of B-cell subsets found that na ve B-cells and activated B-cells were significantly decreased while memory B-cells were transiently significantly increased following treatment with blisibimod, consistent with a correction of the B-cell abnormalities reported in lupus patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	There were no deaths reported between the blisibimod and placebo groups.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Few neutralization antibodies were seen, and all resolved in subsequent visits.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	Based on these results and published data from competitor studies, we conducted a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating blisibimod in lupus patients from the second half of 2010 to the third quarter of 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidate to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including autoimmune diseases and hematological malignancies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	We are advancing the development of blisibimod to exploit the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	We have completed a Phase 2b clinical study with blisibimod in patients with lupus and plan to continue the advancement of blisibimod in a Phase 3 registration program in lupus and IgA nephropathy and a Phase 2 clinical development in multiple myeloma in 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of blisibimod in lupus or in other B-cell mediated diseases, such as IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, multiple myeloma, vasculitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and others that may benefit from BAFF antagonism, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	Orphan indications in renal diseases represent a substantial untapped opportunity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	We intend to build an orphan path upon the secondary data we collected from our Phase 2b PEARL-SC study and recently published renal effects of Benlysta .
1316175_14_ITEM1_P102_S2	It is anticipated that the data will help us select an appropriate orphan path to supplement our approach in lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P102_S3	We believe that this orphan approach will further differentiate blisibimod from other anti-BAFF molecules.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	The progression of patients with IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis to end-stage renal disease poses a considerable cost and societal burden.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	We believe improvement in patient outcomes will allow for premium orphan pricing for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	In addition, we believe successful outcomes in our clinical studies targeting IgA nephropathy will support future lifecycle expansion for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P103_S3	Furthermore, disease-specific dosing regimens may enable product commercialization at substantially different price points.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	Multiple myeloma is also a rare disease with clear unmet medical need.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	The proposed mechanism of action of blisibimod in this disease is to decrease survival of the disease-causing multiple myeloma cells.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	This proposal is supported by the observed increase in BAFF levels in patients, as well as data with BAFF inhibitors showing decreased survival of multiple myeloma cells and improvements in survival and bone lesions in animals transformed with human multiple myeloma.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	The cost and societal burden of multiple myeloma are considerable as the disease typically presents during the 4 th to 7 th decades of a patient s life, and the median survival is 2-4 years for patients with Stage II - III disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	Our product candidate is focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as rheumatologists and nephrologists.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	In other chronic indications, we intend to seek commercial collaborations with companies that have a large, dedicated sales force focused on general practitioners and we plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P107_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P107_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidate are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P108_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidate obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P108_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P108_S4	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and partner GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) obtained FDA approval for Benlysta (belimumab) in 2011 for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P109_S1	Benlysta , the first novel therapy approved in the last 50 years, was acquired by GSK in July 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	Other current therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, corticosteroids, anti-malarials and immunosuppressants generally act to hold back broadly the proliferation of many types of cells, including white blood cells.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P110_S1	However, use of these agents is often associated with limited efficacy or significant adverse events and broad immune suppression.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	Several new biological agents under development have targeted BAFF (like Benlysta ) and other B-cell related pathways for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P111_S1	These product candidates include tabalumab (LY2127399) from Eli Lilly and Company, atacicept, or TACI-Ig, from ZymoGenetics Inc. and epratuzumab from Immunomedics, Inc.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P111_S2	Other pathways targeting both B-cell and non-B-cell mechanisms are in earlier-phase clinical trials, such as Lupuzor from ImmuPharma plc; anti-inhibitors of interferon (IFN) alpha, MEDI-545 and MEDI-546 and rontalizumab; the anti-IFN gamma antibody AMG 811; toll-like receptor inhibitors; the anti-interleukin 6 antibody sirukumab; the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor CC-10004; the anti-CD74 monocloncal antibody milatuzumab; and inhibition of B7 related protein (B7RP-1) pathway with AMG 557.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P111_S3	We believe that blisibimod may offer potential differentiation from these agents, including demonstrated dosing flexibility with both subcutaneous and intravenous delivery; selective modulation and reduction of relevant B-cell types in lupus patients; the ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF; the use of a bacterial expression platform which is expected to translate to lower manufacturing costs compared with therapeutic antibodies; and distinct patent protection based on a novel and proprietary technology developed and commercialized by Amgen.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P112_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_14_ITEM1_P114_S0	operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P115_S0	As of the date of this report, our blisibimod patent portfolio includes:
1316175_14_ITEM1_P116_S0	Eleven pending non-EP foreign patent applications in Brazil, Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Serbia, Montenegro and Slovakia.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P117_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Amgen to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P117_S1	In addition, we hold a non-exclusive worldwide license to one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, one pending EP patent application, and over 50 non-EP foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to general peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022 and November 2023.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P119_S2	This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to as late as May 2027 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P119_S3	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P119_S4	The EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P119_S5	One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P120_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P120_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P120_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P121_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P122_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P122_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	We are aware of two families of third-party U.S. patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P123_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P123_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P123_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P123_S4	If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and possibly requiring us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P123_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing blisibimod, as well as the right to grant sublicenses.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P125_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P125_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P125_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P126_S1	Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than blisibimod that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P127_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we have paid $6.0 million in license fees to Amgen for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P127_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States, European Union or Japan.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P127_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P127_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P127_S4	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P128_S0	The license agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P128_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P129_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP ) with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P129_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidate if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P129_S2	Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P130_S0	Our contract manufacturers obtain the raw materials for the drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies from a variety of sources.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P130_S1	We believe that this will provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials and drug product to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P130_S2	We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical systems, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P131_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P131_S1	Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P131_S2	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by local, state and federal regulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P132_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P132_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P132_S2	In order to commercialize our product candidate, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P132_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidate alone.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P132_S4	In therapeutic areas that require a large sales force selling to a large and diverse prescribing population, we currently plan to partner with third parties to commercialize our product candidate while retaining rights to co-promote our products to a select audience of high prescribing physicians in the United States, thereby supplementing or enhancing the efforts of a commercial partner.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P132_S5	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P133_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidate to market alone or in collaboration with a co-development or co-promotion partner.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P133_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P133_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P134_S0	Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P134_S1	Our product candidate must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process, and our biological product candidate, blisibimod, must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P135_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P135_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P135_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P135_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P136_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_14_ITEM1_P137_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P138_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidate will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P139_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P139_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P139_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P139_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P140_S0	Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P140_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P140_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P140_S3	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P141_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P141_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P141_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P141_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P141_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P142_S0	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P142_S1	Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P143_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_14_ITEM1_P144_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P144_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P145_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P146_S0	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P146_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P147_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P147_S1	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P147_S2	The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P147_S3	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P148_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P148_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P148_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P149_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P149_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P150_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P150_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P150_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P151_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P151_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P151_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P151_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P152_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P152_S1	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P152_S2	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P153_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P153_S1	The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P153_S2	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P153_S3	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P153_S4	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P154_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P154_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P154_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P154_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P154_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P154_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P154_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P155_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P155_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P155_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P156_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P156_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P156_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P156_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P156_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P156_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P156_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P157_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S6	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P158_S7	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P159_S0	HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P159_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P159_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P160_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P160_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P160_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P160_S3	The current pediatric exclusivity provision was reauthorized in September 2007.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P161_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P161_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P161_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P161_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P162_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P162_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P162_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P162_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P163_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P163_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P164_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P164_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P165_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P165_S1	Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P166_S0	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P166_S1	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P167_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P167_S1	A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P167_S2	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P167_S3	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P168_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P168_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P168_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P169_S0	The FDASIA includes a provision that allows sponsors to request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P170_S0	The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P170_S1	The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P171_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P172_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P172_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P172_S2	Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P172_S3	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P173_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P173_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P173_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P174_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P174_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P175_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P175_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P176_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P176_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P176_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P177_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P178_S0	Failure to comply with any requirements under the new law may result in significant penalties.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P178_S1	The new law also authorizes significant civil money penalties for the dissemination of false or misleading direct-to-consumer advertisements and allows the FDA to require companies to submit direct-to-consumer television drug advertisements for FDA review prior to public dissemination.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P178_S2	Additionally, the new law expands the clinical study registry so that sponsors of all clinical studies, except for Phase 1 clinical studies, are required to submit certain clinical study information for inclusion in the clinical study registry data bank.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P179_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P179_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P180_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P180_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P180_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P180_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P181_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P181_S1	European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P182_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P182_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P182_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P183_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P183_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P183_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P183_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P183_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including, at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S3	However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S6	Our product candidate may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S7	It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P184_S8	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P185_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P185_S1	For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P185_S2	Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P185_S3	Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P185_S4	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P185_S5	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P185_S6	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P186_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P186_S1	Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P186_S2	Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P186_S3	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P186_S4	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P186_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P186_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P187_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P187_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P187_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P187_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P188_S0	There are also laws that govern a company s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P188_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company s ability to operate its business.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P189_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P189_S1	We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P189_S2	Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P189_S3	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P189_S4	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P189_S5	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P190_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P191_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidate and operate profitably.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P192_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P193_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P193_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P193_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P193_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P193_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P193_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P194_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had 25 employees.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P194_S1	All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P194_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P195_S0	On July 15, 2013, the Company effectuated a 1-for-8 reverse split of its outstanding common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P195_S1	All references to shares of common stock outstanding and per share data for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect such reverse split.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P196_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P196_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P196_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P197_S0	The mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_14_ITEM1_P198_S0	Through a link on the Investors section of our website (under SEC Filings in the Financial Information section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this report.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We are a development stage company with nine years of operating history.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have focused primarily on developing our three product candidates, blisibimod, varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The two latter product candidates were terminated in March 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have financed our operations exclusively through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, and debt financings and incurred losses in each year since our inception in September 2004.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $287.2 million.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Substantially all of our losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We expect to incur additional losses over the next several years, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate revenues.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have never generated any revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidate, conduct preclinical tests in animals and clinical studies in human beings, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidate and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We have not generated any revenue from our development-stage product candidate, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidate will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidate in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our product candidate is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Currently, we have one product candidate in clinical development, which is blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Blisibimod could fail in clinical studies if we are unable to demonstrate that it is effective or if it causes unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Failure of our product candidate in clinical studies would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidate or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our drug discovery efforts may not produce any other viable or marketable product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Even if our product candidate is approved for commercial sale, the approved product candidate may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Physicians, patients, payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend our product.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Even if we are able to generate product sales, which we cannot guarantee, we may not achieve profitability soon thereafter, if ever.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are unable to generate product revenues, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without additional funding.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our future capital requirements could be substantial and will depend on many factors including:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	revenues received from approved products, if any, in the future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of the date of this report, we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	terminate, reduce or delay our (i) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the development of our product candidate or (ii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidate, if approved for sale.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to Amgen Inc. is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Pursuant to our license agreement with Amgen, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to Amgen is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of blisibimod, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, conducting product development activities for our product candidate, blisibimod, varespladib and varespladib sodium (the two latter product candidate were terminated in March 2012), and performing research and development.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our product candidate which is still under clinical development.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot assure you that our product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidate successfully.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our product candidate blisibimod has completed several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In July 2010, we received clearance from the FDA to begin recruitment of patients with lupus into the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In November 2010, we placed a voluntary hold on the PEARL-SC study due to problems found with vials.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Patient enrollment in the study was temporarily suspended and dosing was discontinued in patients who were enrolled in the study while we conducted an analysis of the problem.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We resolved the issues found with the vials in December 2010.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	After analysis, simulation and consultation with industry experts, we determined that shipping on dry ice was the root cause of the issue.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Shipping logistics were modified and we reinitiated enrollment in PEARL-SC and dosing in January 2011.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We have received no reports of patient-related side effects or problems with drug administration that could be attributed to the vial problem.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	On October 24, 2011 we filed an amendment with the FDA for the PEARL-SC clinical study to modify the primary efficacy lupus response index and to include an option for an interim efficacy analysis.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The trial was completed and results were announced during 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our product candidate is prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidate may not:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are not permitted to market blisibimod, our product candidate, in the United States until we receive approval of a biologics license application, or BLA, from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We have not submitted a BLA or received marketing approval for our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	The FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidate could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, while an independent statistician concluding the interim analysis may determine that the Company has met the pre-specified risk criteria to continue the CHABLIS-SC1 study, the independent DSMB reviewing clinical data may arrive a a different conclusion.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Product development costs to us and our collaborators will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidate or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delaying factors outside our control.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidate could be significantly reduced.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, blisibimod or any other product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidate, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for our product candidate may be adversely impacted.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidate has performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain FDA approval for our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we breach the license agreement for our product candidate, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our primary product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are party to an agreement with Amgen containing exclusive, worldwide licenses of the composition of matter and methods of use for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The agreement requires us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify Amgen under the terms of the agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensor may terminate our exclusive license and may be able to re-obtain licensed technology and aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us that relate to the licensed technology that originated from the licensor.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our licensor could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of blisibimod after an uncured, material breach of our license agreement by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the license could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidate may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidate obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidate is likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The market for inflammatory disease therapeutics is especially large and competitive.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	For lupus, GSK s BAFF antagonist monoclonal antibody, Benlysta , was approved by the FDA for treatment of lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Further, we are aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of lupus: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Merck Serono S.A., whose dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist fusion protein, Atacicept, is in a Phase 2/3 clinical study for lupus; Immunomedics, Inc. and UCB S.A., who reported favorable results for their CD-22 antagonist humanized antibody, epratuzumab, which completed a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus and has begun Phase 3 clinical studies ; and Eli Lilly s anti-AFF monoclonal antibody, Tabalumab (LY2127399), which is conducting two Phase 3 studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our product candidate obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P44_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our product candidate may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidate could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Phase 2 clinical studies conducted by us with our product candidate have generated differences in adverse effects and serious adverse events.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The most common adverse effects seen with any of our product candidate versus placebo include injection site erythema and nasopharyngitis, The most common serious adverse events seen with any of our product candidate include Herpes zoster, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and deep vein thrombosis.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	During the placebo-controlled Phase 2 PEARL study, blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events or infections between blisibimod and placebo.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Discontinuation due to adverse event was slower amongst blisibimod-treated subjects (5.7%) compared to placebo (7.9%).
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Amongst the commonly-reported AEs, imbalance was observed only with injection site reactions (200mg QW blisibimod = 15%, matched placebo = 7%), but these were not serious or severe and did not result in discontinuation of treatment.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If serious adverse events that are considered related to our product candidate is observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate may be adversely impacted.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Further, if our product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our product could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidate and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize our product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate we develop.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and FDA regulatory review.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Even if our product candidate receives regulatory approval, it may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our product candidate will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P53_S4	If we, our product candidate or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidate fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product and generate revenue.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	New legal and regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain approvals for our product candidate and could limit or make more burdensome our ability to commercialize any approved products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	New federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidate or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	For example, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, granted the FDA new authority to impose post-approval clinical study requirements, require safety-related changes to product labeling and require the adoption of risk management plans, referred to in the legislation as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The REMS may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals, and restrictions on distribution and use.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Pursuant to the FDAAA, if the FDA makes the requisite findings, it might require that a new product be used only by physicians with specified specialized training, only in specified designated health care settings, or only in conjunction with special patient testing and monitoring.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P57_S4	The legislation also included the following: requirements for providing the public information on ongoing clinical studies through a clinical study registry and for disclosing clinical study results to the public through such registry; renewed requirements for conducting clinical studies to generate information on the use of products in pediatric patients; and substantial new penalties, for example, for false or misleading consumer advertisements.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P57_S5	Other proposals have been made to impose additional requirements on drug approvals, further expand post-approval requirements, and restrict sales and promotional activities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P57_S6	The new legislation, and the additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidate, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If our product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval does not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The commercial success of our product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of the product by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If our product candidate is approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from the product, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidate may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Paul F. Truex, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Colin Hislop, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Debra Odink, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer and the other principal members of our executive team.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P63_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Also in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P69_S4	These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third-party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, the Health Care Reform Law and additional prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P71_S4	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the European Union and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The use of our product candidate in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	decreased demand for our product candidate, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	If and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidate, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P80_S3	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P83_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P83_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidate may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P83_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P83_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of our approved product candidate may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidate if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P85_S2	If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidate or market them.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidate ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidate in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidate be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of our product candidate in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for product candidate previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The Company initiated activities for large scale purification of its next batch of blisibimod with its contract manufacturer.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	It is anticipated that final product from this product manufacturing campaign will provide sufficient CAHBLIS-SC1 clinical study and the initiation of the second pivotal study in patients with lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidate for our clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P88_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P88_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidate, the commercial launch of our product candidate would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidate, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	If we successfully commercialize any of our drugs, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P89_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, the satisfaction of which on a timely basis may not be met.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidate, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P91_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P93_S3	For example, organizations like the American Heart Association have made recommendations about therapies in the cardiovascular therapeutics market.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	If our or our licensors patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidate or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	As of the date of this report, we hold license rights to numerous U.S., EP, and non-EP foreign patents and patent applications for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Our blisibimod portfolio includes exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We also own several U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications relating to our terminated varespladib sodium/varespladib programs.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	These patents and patent applications include both patents and patent applications originally filed by Anthera and patents assigned to Anthera by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Our varespladib sodium/varespladib portfolio previously included a larger set of patents and patent applications relating to sPLA 2 inhibiting compounds and exclusively licensed from Eli Lilly Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	In August 2012, we provided notice of termination to our collaborators to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P96_S4	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P96_S5	Due to termination of the varespladib programs, we do not expect to incur further payments to our collaborators under the license agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidate and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P97_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidate and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidate and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We are aware of two families of third-party U.S. patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P103_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P103_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P103_S4	If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P103_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P105_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P105_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P105_S3	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P105_S4	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P105_S5	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P105_S6	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P106_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the novel BAFF inhibitor blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	We previously had obtained exclusive, worldwide licenses, except for Japan, of the composition of matter, methods of making and methods of use for certain sPLA 2 compounds from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P107_S2	In August 2012, we provided notice of termination to our collaborators to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P107_S3	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P107_S4	Due to termination of the varespladib programs, we do not expect to incur further payments to our collaborators under the license agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P107_S5	We may enter into additional licenses to third-party intellectual property in the future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering our blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P108_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P108_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P108_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P108_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P108_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and to obtain market exclusivity for our product candidate, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in the regulatory approval process.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Assuming we gain a five-year patent term extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2027 or 2028.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S1	Assuming we gain such a five-year extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s European new chemical entity patents until 2027.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Further, since blisibimod has not been previously approved, blisibimod could be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity from the FDA.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S3	During the data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S4	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small molecule compound or biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that compound or biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such EU regulatory approval, regardless of when the EP new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S5	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S6	However, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P112_S7	If we fail to receive such Hatch-Waxman extensions or marketing exclusivity rights or if we receive extensions that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P113_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We typically develop our product candidate using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P114_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of these product candidate, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P114_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P115_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell any of our product candidate or proposed product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P115_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P116_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the USPTO for the first 18 months after such applications earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P116_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates or proposed product candidate, which would harm our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Litigation or other proceedings such as patent interferences, oppositions, reexaminations, or post-grant reviews may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P119_S1	If we are involved in such litigation or other proceedings, it could cause delays in bringing our product candidate to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidate and proposed product candidate without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidate, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P120_S2	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P120_S3	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors existing or future patents.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P120_S4	In addition, our patents or patent applications or those of others could be subject to other proceedings such as patent interferences, oppositions, reexaminations, or post-grant reviews.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Litigation or other proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidate or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P122_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P123_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring such actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P123_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidate to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidate or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P125_S0	The market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P125_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P126_S0	discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P127_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P127_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P127_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P127_S5	These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P128_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P128_S1	We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P128_S2	Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention from our business.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Because a small number of our existing stockholders own a majority of our voting stock, your ability to influence corporate matters will be limited.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P130_S1	As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P130_S2	These persons will also have the ability to control our management and business affairs.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P130_S3	This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P132_S0	As of December 31 2012 and 2013, there were 9,893,924 and 19,415,901shares, respectively, of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P132_S1	In January 2013, we issued 7,575,757 shares at an initial closing of a public offering, followed by a second closing of 1,136,362 shares in February 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P132_S2	In addition, as of December 31, 2013, we had 2,714,123 outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock, restricted stock units and warrants that, if exercised or released, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P132_S3	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P132_S4	Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P132_S5	Moreover, certain holders of shares of common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P133_S0	We have registered or will register all common stock that we may issue under our 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan ), our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan ) and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P133_S1	As of December 31, 2013, an aggregate of 711,718 shares of our common stock had been reserved for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, plus any shares reserved and unissued or cancelled under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Plan, and an aggregate of 78,873 shares has been reserved for future issuance under our ESPP.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P133_S2	These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P133_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P134_S0	In addition, we may sell shares of stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC ), pursuant to which we have the right to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $18.5 million in shares of the our common stock, of which approximately $15.4 million of shares of our common stock remained available to be sold as of December 31, 2013, and pursuant to a Sales Agreement (the Agreement ) with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen ) for an at-the-market equity program ( ATM ) under which we from time to time may offer and sell up to $25.0 million shares of our common stock, all of which remain available to be sold as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P134_S1	Finally, we maintain effective shelf registration statements on Form S-3 with the SEC for the issuance and sale from time to time of up to approximately $75.2 million of our equity and debt securities.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P135_S0	We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P136_S0	We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P136_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P137_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidate or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P138_S0	We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This material weakness could continue to adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P139_S1	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 and identified a material weakness related to our prior interpretation of ASC 815 and our initial classification and subsequent accounting of warrants as either liabilities or equity instruments.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P139_S2	As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P139_S3	This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our liabilities, non-cash expense relating to the changes in fair value of common stock warrants and accumulated deficit accounts and related financial disclosures and the restatement of our accompanying consolidated financial statements as discussed herein and in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P140_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P140_S1	The effectiveness of any controls or procedures is subject to certain limitations, and as a result, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P140_S2	A control can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be attained.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P140_S3	Although we believe that we have taken actions such that we have remediated this material weakness as of the date of this filing, we can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P140_S4	Additionally, even our improved controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify errors or irregularities or ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P140_S5	If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P142_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P142_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P142_S2	For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P142_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P143_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P143_S1	We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P143_S2	In 2013, our independent registered public accounting firm was not required to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reports due to the exemptions allowed to small companies as part of the Investor Protection Act.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P143_S3	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P143_S4	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P144_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P145_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P145_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P145_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P146_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P147_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P148_S0	the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P149_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P149_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P149_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards will be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P151_S1	An ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P151_S2	We incurred an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 ownership of the Internal Revenue Code during 2012 and as such, our net operating loss carryforward are limited.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P151_S3	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_14_ITEM1A_P151_S4	If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We occupy approximately 14,000 square feet under a facility lease agreement that expires on September 30, 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	In October 2013, pursuant to the terms of the facility lease agreement, we renewed our facility lease for an additional three years beginning October 2014 and ending September 2017.
1316175_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	Total future minimum lease payment over the renewed term of the lease is approximately $495,000.
1316175_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	We believe our existing facility is adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not subject to any material pending legal proceedings.
1316175_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol ANTH since our initial public offering ( IPO ).
1316175_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that offering, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Market:
1316175_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2013, an aggregate of 19,415,901 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by approximately 20 holders of record and beneficial holders, based on information provided by the Company s transfer agent.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	A significantly larger number of stockholders may be "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P2_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III, Item 12 of this report.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	All information under this Item has been previously reported on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC.
1316175_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	We did not repurchase any securities during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	As discussed in the Explanatory Note Regarding Restatement to this Form 10-K, the Company is amending and restating its audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for all the Affected Periods presented in this Item.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	The restated statements of operations data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and the restated balance sheet data at December 2010, 2011 and 2012 should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and notes thereto.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	The data set forth below are qualified by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, the restated consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) See Note 2 to the financial statements contained in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures of the effects of the restatement on the audited consolidated statements of operations .
1316175_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) The consolidated statements of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 have been restated to reflect adjustments related to the restatement described below under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Restatement and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	(3) Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	(4) Excluded weighted-average shares of unvested stock for 2009 of 13,759, for 2010 of 5,956, for 2011 of 1,671 and for 2012 of 137.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P5_S1	These shares were subject to a risk of repurchase by the Company until such shares are vested.
1316175_14_ITEM6_P6_S0	(5) Net loss per basic and diluted share and weighted average shares used in net loss per basic and diluted share have been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split effectuated by the Company on July 15, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	As discussed in the Explanatory Note Regarding Restatement and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are amending and restating our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and our unaudited quarterly and interim financial information for the periods ended March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012 presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations incorporates the restated amounts.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	For this reason, the data set forth in this section may not be comparable to discussion and data in our previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our Phase 3 candidate, blisibimod, targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, (lupus), Immunoglobin A nephropathy (IgA nephropathy), lupus nephritis, vasculitis and others.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Elevated BAFF is also reported in hematological diseases such as multiple myeloma and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in September 2004.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	In January 2012, Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	BAFF, also known as BLyS, is a tumor necrosis family member and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell lineages as well as plasma cells.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Abnormal elevations in BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Based on data from our Phase 2b clinical study, we intend to advance the clinical development of our BAFF inhibitor, blisibimod, to exploit its potential clinical utility in a number of autoimmune diseases.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	We have worldwide rights to blisibimod for all potential indications.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	In 2012, we completed the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Lupus patients suffer from a chronic autoimmune disease, where an inappropriate or abnormal immune response often leads to severe skin rash, fatigue, joint pain, ulceration, major kidney complications, including proteinuria, and cardiovascular disease.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Inhibition of BAFF is believed to reduce survival of B-cells and plasma cells and autoantibodies, leading to a reduction in severity of disease and resolution of lupus symptoms.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our product development program is focused on development of blisibimod for use as a therapeutic treatment for lupus and other serious autoimmune diseases for which we believe current treatments are either inadequate or non-existent.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our current plan includes continuing the ongoing CHABLIS-SC1 clinical study in patients with active lupus and the BRIGHT-SC1 clinical study in patients with IgA nephropathy, and evaluating the potential of blisibimod in additional autoimmune and hematological diseases through clinical and nonclinical investigations.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch scale quantities.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The blisibimod product is designed for at-home, self-administration and is presented as a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	We are actively pursuing various partnerships with major pharmaceutical and biotech companies to develop and commercialize blisibimod for both lupus and IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	In the third quarter of 2012 at an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we presented the results of the PEARL-SC clinical study and our plans for Phase 3 registration studies in patients with active lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	As a result of this meeting we initiated patient enrollment in the initial Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 study in March 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are planned to be multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with seropositive clinically active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard-of-care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Each study plans to randomize up to 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo for 52 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	As agreed with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 studies will be clinical improvement in the SRI-8 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our lupus Phase 3 clinical study CHABLIS-SC1 is currently recruiting at 31 sites across 11 countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	Enrollment rates for the CHABLIS-SC1 study have exceeded our initial expectations and we successfully enrolled more than our target of 100 patients prior to the end of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	A futility analysis of clinical study is planned to be conducted by an independent unblinded statistician in mid-2014 after a minimum of 100 subjects have completed 24 weeks of treatment to confirm the clinical and commercial assumptions of the design of this study.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	This futility analysis is not intended to provide any rules for stopping for overwhelming efficacy, change in study sample size, or alteration of the study design.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Enrollment rates for the CHABLIS-SC1 study have exceeded our initial expectations.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	An independent DSMB will convene to review the study at the end of March 2014 and mid-July 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We enrolled more than 100 patients prior to the end of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Continuing enrollment of the full 400 patients into the CHABLIS-SC1 trial is contingent on a positive outcome from this interim analysis.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Regardless of the outcome of the interim analysis, all patients randomized into the CHABLIS-SC1 study will be allowed to complete the full 52 weeks of blinded treatment to provide additional safety and efficacy data for future regulatory filings for other potential indications for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	In addition to serving as a registration study for a potential lupus indication, we plan to include the safety data from CHABLIS-SC1 in a potential IgA nephropathy marketing application for blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Following recent input from the FDA, we plan to submit a second pivotal study to the FDA in the first quarter of 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	This study is planned to enroll patients with clinical diagnosis of lupus with or without renal disease including patients with glomerulonephritis and patients who may have had a previous diagnosis of lupus nephritis who continue to have active elements of lupus.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Similar to the CHABLIS-SC1 clinical study, the primary endpoint of this second study will be SRI-8 response.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	These two pivotal studies are anticipated to form the basis of approval for blisibimod as a treatment for lupus patients with active disease despite the use of steroids.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The BRIGHT-SC1 study is a Phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Initially we intend to enroll up to 48 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy who have proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr) and are receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	We initiated our BRIGHT-SC1 study in the second quarter of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Patients will receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	When the first 48 patients have completed eight weeks of treatment we plan to conduct an interim analysis to determine the effect of blisibimod on proteinuria and other relevant renal biomarkers such as IgA and IgG levels.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	As a result of discussion with the US FDA on the potential SE of proteinuria as the endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod, the Company amended the BRIGHT-SC1 study endpoints during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	The amendment serves to potentially transform BRIGHT-SC1 into one of two registration studies for blisibimod and adjust its endpoints to patients achieving less than 1 gram of proteinuria per 24 hours at 24 weeks.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	We have gained regulatory approvals in all seven study countries in Southeast Asia and are actively recruiting.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	To date 19 sites have been activated and are actively screening patients.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P28_S6	We anticipate the first 48 patients will complete eight weeks of treatment in the second half of 2014, upon which we plan to conduct an interim analysis to determine the effect of blisibimod on proteinuria.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	In December 2013, we submitted an IND to the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products of the FDA for the investigation of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	This submission incorporated feedback from both the initial meetings with the FDA and PMDA and included a second clinical study protocol, BRILLIANT-SC1.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	We anticipate feedback regarding our IgA development from the FDA in the first quarter of 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study, AN-MMY3321 , to evaluate the effects of blisibimod on survival, progression and biomarkers in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with at least one prior regimen.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Additionally we plan to seek advice on our clinical development plans in multiple myeloma with the Division of Hematology Products of the FDA in mid-2014.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt and debt financings, raising net proceeds of approximately $325.6 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidate, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	In addition to the normal risks associated with development-stage companies, we may never successfully complete development of our product candidate, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidate or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	We do not expect to generate revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize our product candidate or in-license additional products that generate revenue.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	We intend to seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales, up-front fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships and royalties resulting from the licensing of the commercial rights to our intellectual property.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the nature, timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized, as well as any revenue we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidate development programs.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: licensing, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for the continued development of blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	We are developing our product candidate in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project, but rather are allocated across our clinical stage programs.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for 2013, 2012, and 2011, and for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Includes license fees of $4.0 million and milestone payment of $3.5 million pursuant to a license agreement and amendment thereto with each of Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co. Ltd., which were paid in cash, shares of preferred stock and common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Includes a one-time license initiation fee of $6.0 million pursuant to a license agreement with Amgen.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	We intend to fund our clinical studies with existing cash and proceeds from potential future debt and equity offerings.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	As we obtain results from clinical studies, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain clinical development programs in order to focus our resources on more promising clinical development programs.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Completion of clinical studies may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including:
1316175_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P43_S5	If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	None of our product candidate has received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidate and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidate may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions, including clinical, chemical manufacturing, regulatory, finance and business development.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, we believe that the following accounting policy is the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Warrants are recorded either as equity instruments or derivative liabilities at their estimated fair value at the date of issuance.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	In the case of warrants recorded as liabilities, subsequent changes in estimated fair value are recorded in other income (expense) in the Company s statement of operations in each subsequent period.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The warrants are measured at estimated fair value using the Black Scholes valuation model, which is based, in part, upon inputs for which there is little or no observable market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of issuance, and at each subsequent reporting period, based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the measurement date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	The dividend rate is based on our historical rate, which we anticipate to remain at zero.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	The assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the warrants represent our best estimates.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P52_S5	However these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P52_S6	As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	We make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	The majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	We base our accruals related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	In accruing for service fees, we estimate the time and materials incurred by these service providers in each period.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P55_S5	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P55_S6	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, our research and development costs consisted primarily of start-up clinical expenses for the Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 and Phase 2 BRIGHT-SC1 studies and the ongoing costs to support the PEARL-SC OLE study.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Research and development expense decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 mainly due to the completion of the Phase 2 PEARL-SC study in 2012, which contributed to decreases in manufacturing expense, CRO expense and investigator grants by approximately $27.5 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Included in general and administrative expenses were $1.7 million and $0.5 million in stock-based compensation in the years ended 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Excluding the non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation, general and administrative expense decreased in 2013 from 2012 by approximately $1.4 million and reflected our ongoing cost reduction efforts that led to decreases in professional, consulting and overhead expenses.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Other expense recorded in both 2013 and 2012 was a result of net loss realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The decrease in interest expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to the refinancing of our debt from Hercules Technology II, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (together, Hercules) to Midcap Financial SBIC, LP ( Midcap ) and Square 1 Bank in April 2013, which resulted in a significantly reduced interest rate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the year ended 2012 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	The warrants were reclassified from liabilities into equity in July 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	Therefore, there was no mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the year ended 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Research and development expenses decreased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to decreased clinical trial costs of approximately $24.6 million associated with our Phase 3 clinical study of varespladib as a direct result of the termination of the VISTA-16 study in March 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	Furthermore, manufacturing activities for our Phase 2 clinical study of blisibimod were substantially complete by December 2011 and all patients completed dosing by June 2012, which also contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses by approximately $10.8 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	General and administrative expenses decreased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to lower legal costs associated with patent prosecution of varespladib as a result of the termination of the VISTA-16 study in March 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Furthermore, we reduced our spending on consulting and professional services in line with the termination of the varespladib program.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Other expense recorded in 2012 is a result of net loss realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Other income recorded in 2011 was primarily due to realized gain on our short-term investments.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	Interest expense in 2012 included 12 months of interest recognized on our notes payable to Hercules as compared to only 9 months of interest recognized in 2011 because the notes were issued in March 2011.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the years ended 2012 and 2011 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	The fluctuation was primarily due to change in the fair value of our common stock and the related impact on the fair value of the warrant liability.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the quarters and year-to-date periods ended March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012, which are restated from the Company s previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the respective periods, see Note 14 Summarized Quarterly Unaudited Financial Data for Fiscal 2012 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Other income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2013 from the same period in 2012 primarily due to the net gain realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in connection with payments made to overseas vendors.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The decrease in interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 is a direct result of principal payments made on our notes payable to Hercules.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2012 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	The warrants were reclassified from liabilitities into equity in July 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	Therefore, there is no mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Other expense decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2013 from the same period in 2012 primarily due to the net gain realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in connection with payments made to overseas vendors.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase in interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 is primarily due to the Company s payment of the Loan Agreement with Hercules loan in April 2013, which triggered full recognition of an end of term charge as well as unamortized debt issuance cost.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2012 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	The warrants were reclassified from liabilities into equity in July 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P71_S4	Therefore, there is no mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Other income decreased during the six months ended June 30, 2013 from the same period in 2012 primarily due to net gain realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in connection with payments made to overseas vendors.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in interest expense during six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 is primarily due to the Company s payment of the Loan Agreement with Hercules in April 2013, which triggered full recognition of an end of term charge as well as unamortized debt issuance cost.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2012 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	The warrants were reclassified from liabilities into equity in July 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	Therefore, there is no mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Other income (expense) increased during the three months ended September 30, 2013 from the same period in 2012 primarily due to interest earned on our cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Other expense for the three months ended September 2012 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange fluctuations in connection with payments made to our overseas vendors.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	The decrease in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 is primarily due to the refinancing of our debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in April 2013, which resulted in significantly reduced interest rate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2012 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	The warrants were reclassified from liabilities into equity in July 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P73_S5	Therefore, there is no mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Other income (expense) increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 from the same period in 2012 primarily due to interest earned on our cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Other expense for the three months ended September 2012 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange fluctuations in connection with payments made to our overseas vendors.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	The decrease in interest expense during nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 is primarily due to the refinancing of our debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in April 2013, which resulted in significantly reduced interest rate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P74_S4	The warrants were reclassified from liabilities into equity in July 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P74_S5	Therefore, there is no mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt, debt financings and our IPO raising net proceeds of approximately $325.6 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $25.9 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, and our capital expenditure needs.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	On April 5, 2013, we entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC ), pursuant to which we have the right to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $18.5 million in shares of the our common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	Upon executing the agreement, LPC made an initial purchase of $2.0 million in shares of common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	Subsequent to the initial purchase, we have sold approximately $1.1 million in shares of common stock to LPC in 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	As of December 31, 2013, approximately $15.4 million of shares of our common stock remained available to be sold under the Purchase Agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	On November 15, 2013, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the Agreement ) with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen ) to create an at-the-market equity program ( ATM ) under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million through Cowen, as agent.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had not sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the Agreement.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	In January 2012, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179043), which was declared effective on January 24, 2012, for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	In July 2012, we issued 4,743,750 shares of common stock at $8.00 per share pursuant to the shelf registration, raising net proceeds of approximately $35.6 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	In January 2013, we issued 7,575,757 shares of common stock at $5.28 per share under the shelf registration at an initial closing of a public offering, followed by 1,136,362 at a second closing in February 2013, raising net proceeds of approximately $42.7 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	In April 2013, we increased the amount of securities that may be issued under the registration statement by $3.2 million through the filing of a post-effective amendment pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P80_S4	In April 2013, we registered approximately $19.0 million for sale under the LPC Purchase Agreement, leaving a balance of approximately $205,000 under this shelf registration statement for future issuance as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	In April 2013, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-187780) for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	On November 15, 2013, we registered $25.0 million under the registration statement for the Cowen ATM.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we have not sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM and $75.0 million remains available for future issuance under this shelf registration statement.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Based on the requirements of Form S-3, however, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock and our stock price, which limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through Purchase Agreement and registration statements described above.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Cash flow from operations during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	During 2013 and 2012, our operating activities used cash of $31.9 million and $73.6 million, respectively, primarily resulting from our decreased net losses and changes in our working capital accounts.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	The decrease in cash used in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to lower net loss recognized in 2013 as a result of significant decreases in research and development expense as well as general and administrative expense due to the Company focusing exclusively on the development of blisibimod.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	In addition, interest expense also decreased significantly in 2013 as compared to 2012 as a result of our refinancing of our long-term debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in early 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	During 2013 and 2012, cash used in investing activities was $4.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	The increase in cash used in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to the establishment of $10.0 million in restricted cash in 2013 as a result of our refinancing our long-term debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	The increase in restricted cash was offset by a decrease in purchase of short-term investments by $10.7 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	During 2013 and 2012, financing activities provided cash of $43.1 million and $31.3 million, respectively.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to higher proceeds received from the sale of our common stock through public offerings and pursuant to an equity purchase agreement with LPC, which was offset by $22.4 million in principal payments to Hercules and Midcap.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Cash flow from operations during the years ended December 21, 2012 and 2011 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	During the years ended 2013 and 2012, our operating activities used cash of $73.6 million and $73.6 million, respectively, primarily resulting from our net losses and changes in our working capital accounts.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	C ash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was higher as compared to the previous year primarily due to payments made to vendors in 2013 against payables accrued as of the end of 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	During 2012, cash used in investing activities was $3.8 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	During 2011, cash provided by investing activities was $20.2 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	Our investing activities in both 2012 and 2011 consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of short term investments.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	During 2012 and 2011, financing activities provided cash of $31.3 million and $78.4 million, respectively.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2012 as compared to 2011 was mainly attributable to lower proceeds received from the sale of our common stock through public offerings.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	Additionally, we issued notes payable to Hercules in March 2011 from which we received net proceeds of $24.7 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	We have lease obligations consisting of an operating lease for our operating facility that expires in September 2017.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	In April 2013, we entered into borrowing agreements with Midcap and Square 1 Bank for an aggregate of $20.0 million.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	We used the proceeds from the new loans to repay the outstanding balance owed to Hercules.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following table summarizes our estimated scheduled future minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	The above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidate in development, as these payments are not determinable.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Under our license agreement with Amgen to develop and commercialize blisibimod, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable on a country-by-country basis and licensed on a product-by-licensed-product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicensee in such country, or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidate into clinical studies and as we:
1316175_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	implement new operational, financial and management information systems.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	the acquisition of technologies, product candidate and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	As of the date of this report, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to conduct additional or extended clinical studies and seek regulatory approval of our product candidate.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidate, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities, if convertible, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to terminate, significantly modify or delay our development programs, or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidate that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1316175_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1316175_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
1316175_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
1316175_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, since a majority of our investments are in highly liquid money market funds, we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure.
1316175_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2013, we did not have any material derivative financial instruments.
1316175_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents was $25.9 million as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities.
1316175_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary.
1316175_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth beginning in Item 15 of this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to that company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, have concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2013, due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process, effected by an entity s board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures which pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management s and or the board of directors authorization; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material errors in our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with our policies and procedures may deteriorate.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) .
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	In connection with the restatement discussed below and in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Based on this reassessment using the COSO criteria, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, because of a material weakness relating to accounting for warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P6_S4	Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls over the identification and proper accounting treatment of certain terms and conditions in the warrant agreements.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P6_S5	This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our liabilities, non-cash expense relating to the changes in fair value of common stock warrants and accumulated deficit accounts and related financial disclosures and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and each of the quarterly periods (including the period from Inception) from March 31, 2012 through September 30, 2012 (the Affected Periods ).
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P6_S6	Additionally, this deficiency resulted in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that resulted in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	For the quarter ended December 31, 2013, our independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP was not required to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reports due to the exemptions allowed to small companies under the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	On March 10, 2014, in connection with an internal accounting review related to the accounting for warrants issued in conjunction with a private placement of the Company s common stock in September 2010 , the Company, in consultation with its Audit Committee, concluded that its previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012 should be restated because of a misapplication in the guidance around accounting for warrants that were historically reflected as a component of equity as opposed to liabilities as required under the applicable accounting pronouncements and should no longer be relied upon.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	However, the non-cash adjustments to the consolidated financial statements, in all of the Affected Periods, do not impact the amounts previously reported for the Company s cash and cash equivalents, operating expenses, total operating, investing or financing cash flows, and net operating loss carryforward.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Management has been actively engaged in developing a remediation plan to address the material weakness.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Implementation of the remediation plan is in process and consists of establishing a formal review process of non-routine and complex transactions, including but not limited to equity transactions and licensing transactions, reassessing the original accounting assessment for each of the Company s historical warrants and any on-going accounting impact.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Management has completed this assessment during March 2014 and the results of this analysis have been used to adjust the Affected Periods in the restated documents.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Management believes the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the material weakness.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P10_S1	As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, management may execute additional measures to address potential control deficiencies or modify the remediation plan described above.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Management will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of the Company s internal control.
1316175_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1316175_14_ITEM15_P4_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a development stage company (the Company ), as of December 31, 2013 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for year then ended and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the period from inception (September 9, 2004) to December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P4_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P4_S3	We did not audit the consolidated financial statements of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the period from inception to December 31, 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P4_S4	Such statements are included in the cumulative inception to December 31, 2013 totals of the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, and cash flows and reflect a net loss of 89% of the cumulative total.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P4_S5	Those statements were audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to amounts for the period from inception to December 31, 2012, included in the cumulative totals, is based solely on the report of other auditors.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_14_ITEM15_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P5_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P5_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P6_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P7_S0	In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of other auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December 31, 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and for the period from inception (September 9, 2004) to December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:
1316175_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a development stage company) (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2012.

1316175_14_ITEM15_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P10_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P10_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1316175_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	In our opinion, such 2012 and 2011 financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1316175_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company or Anthera ) was incorporated on September 9, 2004 in the state of Delaware.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	Anthera is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	The Company s primary product candidate, blisibimod, targets elevated levels of B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been associated with a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, multiple myeloma, vasculitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and others.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	In January 2012, Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company s activities since inception have consisted principally of acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital, and performing research and development.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development stage as of December 31, 2013, as defined by guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ).
1316175_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets; secure financing; develop a customer base; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and develop strategic alliances.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P26_S3	To date, the Company has funded its operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt and debt financings, raising net proceeds of approximately $325.6 million.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	From September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2013, the Company had an accumulated a deficit of $287.2 million.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	During 2013, the Company incurred a net loss of $30.9 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $31.9 million.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations over the next several years during its clinical development phase.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	To fully execute its business plan, the Company will need to complete certain research and development activities and clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	Further, the Company s product candidate will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	These activities may span many years and require substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P29_S3	Any delays in completing these activities could adversely impact the Company.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P29_S4	The Company plans to meet its capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P29_S5	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	On July 15, 2013, the Company effectuated a 1-for-8 reverse split of its common stock.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	All references to shares of common stock outstanding and per share data for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect such reverse split.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	Subsequent to the issuance of the Company s 2012 consolidated financial statements, the Company concluded that its previously issued 2012, 2011 and 2010 consolidated financial statements should be restated because of a misapplication in the guidance around accounting for the warrants issued in September 2010.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	On September 24, 2010, in connection with a private placement of the Company s Common Stock, the Company issued warrants to the investors to purchase an aggregate of 525,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $26.40 per share.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	These warrants have an exercise period of five years and will expire on September 24, 2015.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P32_S2	The warrants provided the holders with anti-dilution price protection in the event the Company issues securities at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P32_S3	Historically, the warrants were reflected as a component of equity as opposed to liabilities on the balance sheets and the statements of operations did not include the subsequent non-cash changes in estimated fair value of the warrants in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
1316175_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Under the guidance of ASC 815, warrant instruments that provide for anti-dilution price protection, should be initially classified as derivative liabilities at their estimated fair values.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	In periods subsequent to issuance, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments should be recorded as non-cash income or expense in the statement of operations until the applicable warrants are exercised or the exercise price of the warrants becomes fixed.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P33_S2	Management, in consultation with the Company s Audit Committee, determined that the financial statements should be restated to reflect the warrants as liabilities, with subsequent changes in their estimated fair value recorded as non-cash income or expense until the exercise price of the warrants became fixed on July 24, 2012 upon the closing of an equity offering by the Company pursuant to which the Company sold common stock at $8.00 per share, which triggered an adjustment to the exercise price of the warrants to a floor price of $23.20 per share as specified in the warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	The effects of the restatement on the following financial statement line items as of and for the periods indicated are summarized in the following tables (in thousands except share and per share amounts, net loss per basic and diluted share has been adjusted for the Company s 1-for-8 reverse split of its outstanding common stock effectuated on July 15, 2013) :
1316175_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	In addition to the effects on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, and consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, discussed above, the restatement affected the additional paid-in capital and deficit accumulated during the development stage as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 as follows:
1316175_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	The restatement effect on the statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment on the warrant liability of $14,070, $3,738 and $6,300, respectively, and an offsetting effect on net loss recorded for the respective periods, resulting in no net impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	Therefore, the consolidated statements of cash flows are not included as there were no changes to the Company s operating , investing and financing net cash flows as previously reported.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical accounting policies or estimates related to clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P37_S3	Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash currencies and money market funds, for which the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Securities with maturity exceeding three months but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on specific identification method and are reported in the statements of operations.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had restricted cash of $10.0 million to fund a cash security account related to its Square 1 Bank Loan Agreement (see Note 8 for further details).
1316175_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company did not have any restricted cash at December 31, 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	The Company s cash equivalents consist of certificates of deposit with maturities less than three months and treasury money market funds.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	The Company s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with maturities exceeding three months but less than one year.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P41_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P41_S4	The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to five years, using the straight-line method.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the life of the related asset, whichever is shorter.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company s long-lived assets and other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	Through December 31, 2013, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Warrants are recorded either as equity instruments or derivative liabilities at their estimated fair value at the date of issuance.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	In the case of warrants recorded as liabilities, subsequent changes in estimated fair value are recorded in other income (expense) in the Company s statement of operations in each subsequent period.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	The warrants are measured at estimated fair value using the Black Scholes valuation model, which is based, in part, upon inputs for which there is little or no observable market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P48_S1	Inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of issuance, and at each subsequent reporting period, based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the measurement date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P49_S2	The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P49_S3	The dividend rate is based on our historical rate, which we anticipate to remain at zero.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P49_S4	The assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the warrants represent our best estimates.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P49_S5	However these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P49_S6	As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P50_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P50_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies are generally accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on the Company s behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	The majority of service providers invoice at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	The Company periodically confirms the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and makes adjustments if necessary.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P51_S3	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	Clinical study expenses are further separated into two main categories: clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with manufacturing campaign, product formulation and chemical analysis.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company charges research and development costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	Clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	All of the Company s clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	The Company accrues costs for clinical studies performed by CROs based on patient enrollment activities and adjusts the estimates, if required, based upon the Company s ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P55_S4	The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the CROs, and adjusts the estimates, if required, on a monthly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended by each CRO.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	All material CRO contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and the Company is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain noncancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Comprehensive loss consists of certain changes in equity that is excluded from net loss.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	Specifically, the Company includes unrealized losses on available for sale securities in other comprehensive loss.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	Comprehensive loss for each period presented is set forth in the Statement of Comprehensive Loss.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company operates in only one segment.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company s long-lived tangible assets consisted of mainly machineries purchased by the Company and installed by its contract manufacturing vendor, Fujifilm Diosynth Boservices, in the United Kingdom.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	The machineries are used for all of the Company s blisibimod product manufacturing campaigns.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	The computation of diluted Earnings Per Share, or EPS, is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P62_S2	The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	Diluted EPS is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s calculation of net loss per common share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	As the Company incurred net losses for all of the periods presented, the following outstanding potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the effect of including them would have been antidilutive:
1316175_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, and rights to purchase shares under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our consolidated financial statements over the employees requisite service period.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	Additionally, the Company is required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Expected Term The Company s expected term represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Expected Volatility Expected volatility is estimated using comparable public company volatility for similar terms.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has never paid dividends and has no plans to pay dividends.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing method is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	The estimated forfeiture rate is determined based on the Company s historical forfeiture rates to date.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company monitors actual expenses and periodically updates the estimate.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with guidance provided by the FASB and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and recognized as expense over the related service period.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company s cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company s cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2012 were as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	Realized losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2013 were immaterial.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P76_S3	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
1316175_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and readily accessible by us at the reporting date.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there are little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	The following tables present the Company s fair value hierarchy for all its financial assets (including those in cash and cash equivalents), in thousands, by major security type measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of the principal amount of the Company s outstanding notes payable are classified within the hierarchy as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	The fair value of notes payable is estimated based on current interest rates available to us for debt instruments in similar terms, degrees of risk and remaining maturities.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	The carrying value of these obligations, as of each period presented, approximate their respective fair values.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	For disclosure purposes, the fair value of the principal amount of our outstanding debt obligations is considered to be a Level 3 measurement.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	There were no transfers between Level 3, Level 2 or Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	Property and equipment are comprised of the following (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company recorded the following depreciation expense in the respective periods (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company leases its main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	The lease is for approximately 14,000 square feet and expires on September 30, 2014.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P87_S2	The Company recognizes rental expense on the facility on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P87_S3	Differences between the straight-line net expense on rent payments is classified as deferred rent liability and included in the accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P87_S4	In November 2013, the Company renewed its facility lease for an additional three years beginning October 2014 and ending September 2017.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	Rent expense was as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2013, future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	In December 2007, the Company with Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement (the Amgen Agreement ) to develop and commercialize blisibimod in any indication, including for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ).
1316175_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company paid a nonrefundable, upfront license fee of $6.0 million.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P90_S2	As there is no future alternative use for the technology, the Company expensed the license fee in research and development expenses during 2007.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company is obligated to make additional milestone payments to Amgen of up to $33.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company is also obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the high single digits to the low double digits, which are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	The Company s royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P91_S3	As of December 31, 2013, there were no outstanding obligations due to Amgen.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	In March 2011, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement ( Loan Agreement ) with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. and Hercules Technology II, L.P. (together, Hercules ).
1316175_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	In conjunction with the Hercules loan, the Company issued a seven-year warrant to purchase 40,178 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $48.00 per share.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P92_S2	The warrant is immediately exercisable and expires in March 2018.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P92_S3	The Company estimated the fair value of this warrant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following assumptions: expected term of seven years, a risk-free interest rate of 2.87%, expected volatility of 63% and 0% expected dividend yield, resulting in a $1.3 million discount from the par value of the loan, which was amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P92_S4	Additionally, the Company was obligated to pay an end of the term charge of $937,500, which was also being expensed over the term of the loan.

1316175_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB, this modification resulted in the RSUs being classified as a liability, and the subsequent change in fair value to be recorded as expense.

1316175_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	The significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 2013, 2012, and 2011 is as follows:
1316175_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	Tax benefits of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carryforwards are recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is more likely than not.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P144_S1	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P144_S2	Because of the Company s history of operating losses, management believes that the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits are currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P144_S3	The net valuation allowance increased by $11.9 million in 2013, decreased by $38.3 million and increased by $39.2 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $54.4 million for the period from September 9, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	The amount of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with excess tax deduction from stock-based compensation arrangement that is allocated to contributed capital of the future tax benefits are subsequently recognized in the amount of $1.4 million.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	Net operating losses and tax return credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2013, are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Company incurred a Section 382 ownership change in 2012 and as such, the Company's net operating loss carryforwards have been limited.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P148_S1	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P148_S2	As a result of the Section 382 limitation, a significant portion of the Company s net operating losses and R D credits (deferred tax assets) have been written off.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million, all of which would not currently affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company s deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P149_S1	The Company did not anticipate any significant change to the unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P149_S2	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the $1.3 million reduction in the unrecognized tax benefit related to prior years positions is due to the Section 382 limitation discussed above.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company would classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, if applicable.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P151_S1	There was no interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through December 31, 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P151_S2	The tax years 2004 through 2013 remain open to examination by one or more major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized net tax benefits will significantly change prior to the end of 2013.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P153_S0	Quarterly results were as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
1316175_14_ITEM15_P154_S0	As discussed in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company determined it needed to restate its previously issued consolidated financial information, including the unaudited financial information for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P154_S1	The restatement resulted from a correction to the accounting of warrants issued by the Company in connection with a private placement of its common stock in September 2010.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P154_S2	The restatement does not have any net impact on operating, investing and financing cash flows previously reported in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P154_S3	Therefore, the consolidated statements of cash flows are not included herein.
1316175_14_ITEM15_P154_S4	The following tables summarize the effects of the restatement on its previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per share data):

1316175_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs .
1316175_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our first Phase 3 product candidate, blisibimod, licensed from Amgen in December 2007, targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), or lupus, Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our second Phase 3 product candidate, liprotamase, licensed from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014, is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	BAFF, or B-cell Activating Factor, (also known as B lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS), is a member of a tumor necrosis family of natural human proteins and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell families as well as plasma cells all of which are critical to the human immune response.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and other dangerous antigens.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Abnormally high elevations of BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including lupus and IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Based on data from our Phase 2b clinical study, we have advanced the clinical development of our BAFF inhibitor, blisibimod, to exploit its potential clinical utility in a number of autoimmune diseases.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	In 2012, we completed the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Lupus patients suffer from a chronic autoimmune disease, where an inappropriate or abnormal immune response often leads to severe skin rash, fatigue, joint pain, ulceration, major kidney complications, including proteinuria, and cardiovascular disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Inhibition of BAFF is believed to reduce survival of B-cells and plasma cells and autoantibodies, leading to a reduction in severity of disease and resolution of lupus symptoms.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	The development program for blisibimod is focused on evaluating the efficacy and safety of blisibimod in patients with lupus, and IgA nephropathy for which we believe current treatments are either inadequate or non-existent.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our current plan includes continuing the ongoing CHABLIS-SC1 registration clinical study in patients with active lupus and the BRIGHT-SC phase 2/3 clinical study in patients with IgA nephropathy, and evaluating the potential of blisibimod in hematological diseases through clinical and nonclinical investigations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch-scale quantities.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	The blisibimod product is designed for at-home, self-administration and is presented as a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Liprotamase is a novel non-porcine PERT that contains three biotechnology-derived digestive enzymes: a lipase, a protease and an amylase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	The lipase in liprotamase is more stable than the porcine derived lipase in the low pH environment of the stomach and therefore liprotamase does not have an enteric polymer coating, nor does it contain porcine proteins or purines that may be associated with a risk of viral transmission or allergic reaction to proteins of porcine origin.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The individual enzyme components of liprotamase are formulated at a fixed ratio of lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The liprotamase enzyme dose ratio was selected from preclinical efficacy studies conducted using a canine model of pancreatic insufficiency which demonstrated that the lipase enzyme in liprotamase was efficacious when administered at 500 units/kg per meal, and the protease doses 1000 units/kg per meal (Borowitz et al . 2006).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	This finding is further supported by the similar efficacy observed between liprotamase and Creon in pigs with surgically-induced pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is currently the mainstay of treatment for nutrient malabsorption in patients with digestive enzyme deficiencies known as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, or EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	EPI occurs when diseases such as cystic fibrosis, or CF, and chronic pancreatitis impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Orally delivered porcine PERTs have been available for many years for the treatment of EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Unmet medical needs for the treatment of EPI remain.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	For example, as the porcine-derived proteins contained in the PERTs pass through the low pH environment of the stomach, enzyme activity rapidly diminishes and, as a consequence, large doses of porcine enzymes are often required.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Since protease and lipase can become irreversibly inactivated in an acid environment, most products are provided as enteric-coated microbeads.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Patient-to-patient variability in acidification of the intestine makes dissolution variable.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Poor stability and variability in terms of potency and pharmaceutical properties have also been identified as important factors contributing to a poor response of some patients to PERTs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	In the third quarter of 2012 at an End of Phase 2 meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we presented the results of the PEARL-SC study and our plans for Phase 3 registration studies in patients with active lupus.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	As a result of this meeting we initiated patient enrollment in the initial Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 study in March 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	CHABLIS-SC1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with seropositive, clinically-active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard-of-care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The study is currently enrolling in 12 countries across Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	The study plans to randomize up to 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo in addition to their standard-of-care medication for 52 weeks.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	We expect to complete enrollment in mid-2015 and receive topline data after the last enrolled patient completes 52 weeks of treatment in mid-2016.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	The primary endpoint of the CHABLIS-SC1 will be clinical improvement in the SRI-6 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S5	Key secondary outcomes from the study, including SRI-8, reduction in the number of lupus flares and steroid use, are intended to further differentiate blisibimod from currently available therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S6	To date, enrolled patient demographics and disease characteristics for the CHABLIS-SC1 study are consistent with our goal to enroll patients with higher levels of lupus activity and positive biomarkers despite the stable use of corticosteroids.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P19_S7	These characteristics were associated with improved outcomes in both our previous Phase 2 clinical study as well as in two large Phase 3 studies conducted with other BAFF-inhibitors, belimumab (Benlysta) and, more recently, tabalumab.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	We believe the CHABLIS development program for blisibimod may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed BAFF antagonist and other novel B-cell directed therapies, including:
1316175_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	1 picomolar affinity for BAFF , compared to the 120-350 picomolar reported for anti-BAFF monoclonal antibodies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meets regularly over the course of the study to assess patient safety.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	During these regular meetings, the DSMB reviews un-blinded safety data which include adverse events, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or SUSARs, deaths, laboratory data, and withdrawal data and compares trends between treatments.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	After the most recent scheduled meeting in October 2014, the DSMB recommended continuing the CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	In February 2015, an interim analysis of CHABLIS-SC1 was conducted by an independent un-blinded statistician, who evaluated at a pre-specified time point, the proportion of responders to the systemic lupus erythematous SRI-6 responder index, and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	This futility analysis was not intended to provide any rules for stopping for overwhelming efficacy, for a change in study sample size, or for an alteration of the study design.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Rather, the analysis suggests that the observed data conforms with the assumptions upon which the trial was designed.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	The systemic lupus erythematosus response index is a recognized endpoint by the FDA for previously approved therapeutics.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Prior to the interim analysis and in response to input from our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluated the published clinical data from other recent lupus studies with BAFF inhibitors, we modified the primary endpoint of CHABLIS-SC1 from a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-8 responder index to a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-6 responder index (previously a secondary endpoint of the study).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	The available data suggests an improved consistency of the SRI-6 endpoint across multiple trials.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	Response rates to the SRI-8 responder index will remain a key secondary endpoint of the study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P24_S4	In addition to serving as a registration study for a potential lupus indication, observations in this study are intended to be included in marketing applications for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy and other indications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	In the first quarter of 2014, we submitted the protocol to the FDA for our second lupus registration study, CHABLIS-SC2.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	In light of the emerging publication of data from completed clinical trials with SLE, the study design of the CHABLIS-SC2 study is currently being refined with a panel of lupus clinical experts and we plan to finalize the design in the second half of 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We are currently investigating blisibimod as a therapy for IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger s disease).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	According to the National Organization of Rare Disease, IgA nephropathy, an orphan indication, is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually in the United States.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	In Asia, a similar prevalence to the United States would be estimated to affect over 500,000 people annually.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	In Asia, routine urinalyses are often performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for any patients with asymptomatic hematuria, thus raising the reported prevalence of the disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	IgA nephropathy may occur when plasma B-cells express excessive amounts of abnormal IgA and subsequent immune complexes containing this immunogenic protein are deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	These IgA deposits build up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (Wyatt Julian, 2013), primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Figure 3 - Data for the cumulative renal survival rate observed from the time of renal biopsy until a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease in 1,012 patients with IgA nephropathy (Presented by Moriyama and colleagues at the American Society of Nephrology, 2013).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Similar to patients with other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, in IgA nephropathy, elevated levels of BAFF are associated with severity of disease activity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	In patients with IgA nephropathy, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	In IgA nephropathy, increased plasma B-cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Significant reductions in plasma B-cells were observed in previous clinical studies of patients with lupus with another BAFF inhibitor antibody, belimumab.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	In our PEARL-SC Phase 2b study, significant reductions in total B-cells as well as significant improvements in proteinuria and increases in complement C3 were observed with blisibimod in lupus patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce proliferative B-cells and plasma B-cells, reduce serum levels of IgA and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The BRIGHT-SC study is a Phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	We intend to enroll up to 200 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy who have proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr) and are receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	We initiated our BRIGHT-SC study in the second quarter of 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P34_S4	The BRIGHT-SC clinical study is currently recruiting patients primarily in Southeast Asia.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P34_S5	We intend to expand the study in the EU, North America and Latin America in 2015 with the goal to complete enrollment by the first half of 2016.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P34_S6	We plan to conduct an interim futility analysis in the first quarter of 2015 to determine the effect of blisibimod on proteinuria after a minimum of eight weeks of treatment.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	In September 2013, we met with the FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as an endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	In this meeting we gained the PMDA s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan and have amended the BRIGHT-SC study to include the specific data requirements of the PMDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P35_S4	We reached an agreement with the EMA on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable as well as the requirement for a single study to support a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application ( CMAA ) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study, would be available post approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P35_S5	The EMA also recommended the protocol to provide information on the required duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P35_S6	The BRIGHT SC protocol will be amended to reflect these recommendations from the EMA, along with other recommendations from the FDA and PMDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Liprotamase is a novel PERT intended for the treatment of EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	The exocrine pancreas is responsible for synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, including lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	EPI occurs when diseases such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) and chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	A reduction in, or absence of the normally secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes, causes lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to enter the distal gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract in unabsorbable forms, leading to GI pain and distention, maldigestion, and steatorrhea.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Without appropriate therapy, patients with EPI may experience malnutrition, poor growth or weight loss, reduced quality of life, and, in severe cases, increased morbidity and early death.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	We believe liprotamase is potentially the first soluble, stable and non-porcine derived enzyme product to offer a novel solution to patients who are unable to maintain appropriate nutritional health with existing enzyme therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Liprotamase s chemical characteristics, unlike currently available PERTs, make it ideal for powder formulation as either a capsule or sachet product, which can be conveniently co-administered with a small volume of water.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Upon completion of the development and manufacture of liprotamase in sachet formulation, we plan to initiate the SOLUTION study in the second half of 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	SOLUTION is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of liprotamase in patients with cystic fibrosis-related exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	This pivotal study is intended to evaluate the non-inferiority of liprotamase compared with other commercially available PERT in a population enriched for PERT responders.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	We believe the SOLUTION study may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed PERTs, including:
1316175_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	lower pill burden given a larger concentration of lipase per capsule: adult patients who may prefer liprotamase capsules will be able to take fewer capsules and smaller capsules in order to attain the same enzyme dosage.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	The size of the capsule can be smaller than comparable procine-PERTs since a relatively high dose (lipase units) of non-enterically-coated liprotamase enzymes can be packed into small capsules compared to the large capsules necessary for the crude procine pancrease enterically-coated extract.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Lupus is an autoimmune disorder that involves inflammation that causes swelling, pain and tissue damage throughout the body.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Lupus can affect any part of the body, but especially the skin, heart, brain, lungs, joints and kidneys.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	The course of the disease is unpredictable, with periods of illness, called flares, alternating with remission.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P44_S3	Although lupus may affect people of either sex, women are 10 times more likely to suffer from the disease than men, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P44_S4	According to the Alliance for Lupus Research, it is estimated that up to 1.5 million people have lupus in the United States.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P44_S5	Lupus Europe estimates that one in 750 women suffers from lupus in Europe and that lupus is a worldwide disease more common in some races than others.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	It is estimated that approximately 10% of people with lupus are treated in the United States.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	These patients are further categorized into three disease categories ranging from mild, moderate, to severe.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	Based on the results from our PEARL-SC study, we believe patients in the moderate to severe disease categories, approximately 30,000 to 40,000 people, are likely to benefit most from treatment with blisibimod and this is the population we are enrolling in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Patients with active lupus may have a broad range of symptoms related to an abnormally active immune response in one or more organs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	In the brain, lupus may cause seizures and other neurologic abnormalities.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	In the heart, lupus may cause heart failure or sudden death.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	Lung inflammation in the lung may cause shortness of breath, pleurisy and chest pain.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	Lupus may also cause swollen joints, arthritis, muscle aches, proteinuria, severe rash, oral ulcers and alopecia.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P46_S5	In addition, patients with lupus nephritis may require kidney dialysis or eventual transplantation.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production are known to be central to the process.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF plays an important role in this disease process.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	In addition, treatment of lupus-prone mice with blisibimod ameliorates the disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a human antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity, which is a portion of the immune system that provides protection to an organism s various mucous membranes from invasion by infections.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	IgA nephropathy (also known as IgA nephritis or Berger's disease) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidney) throughout the world and a principal cause of end-stage renal disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	The prevalence of IgA nephropathy varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan and China), Australia, Finland and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulonephritis).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein, especially aberrant and immunogenic forms of IgA, is deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	These immunogenic IgA immune complexes deposit inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and, as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	The classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) of signs and symptoms in patients with IgA nephropathy is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection or (less commonly) gastrointestinal or urinary infection.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Men are affected three times as often as women.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	In the United States, IgA nephropathy is considered an orphan disease as it is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually, although this number might prove to be higher with more robust screening.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for patients with asymptomatic hematuria and the reported prevalence of the disease is much higher.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	For example, in Japan, IgA nephropathy is estimated to affect over 350,000 people annually.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	According to IMS Health, EPI is a disease that affects an estimated 250,000 patients in the United States.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	The most common causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, the former a longstanding inflammation of the pancreas altering the organ's normal structure and function that can arise as a result of malnutrition, heredity, or (in the western world especially), behavior (alcohol use and smoking), and the latter a recessive hereditary disease most common in Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews where the molecular culprit is an altered, CFTR-encoded chloride channel.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	In children, another common cause is Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the SBDS gene.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	In December 2011, we completed the manufacturing site transfer from Amgen Inc., or Amgen, to our contract manufacturing organization ( CMO ), Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices ( Fujifilm ).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	We also scaled up manufacturing from 300 liters up to 3,000 liters.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	Two batches of blisibimod produced under U.S. and EU good manufacturing procedures ( GMPs ), at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch scale volumes to support the CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	We are currently evaluating an auto injector strategy for the product presentation.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Phase 3 program for blisibimod was presented to the European Medicines Agency (EMA, Scientific Advice) in the second quarter of 2012, to the FDA in the third quarter of 2012 (End-of-Phase 2 meeting) and to the FDA in a follow-up advice procedure in the third quarter of 2013 (Type C request to which the FDA provided written responses in lieu of a meeting).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	The Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC program incorporates feedback and advice obtained from both regulatory agencies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS-SC2) are planned to be multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies intended to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with clinically active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard of care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	The design of the second Phase 3 study, CHABLIS-SC2, will be based on input from clinical experts as well as evaluation from recently reported data with tabalumab.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	The study design is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	An Investigational New Drug application, or IND, submitted to the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products of the FDA for the investigation of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy, is now in effect.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	The Phase 3 program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy builds on the SLE program and the CHABLIS studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	A single pivotal study (BRIGHT-SC) evaluating the change in proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint to support an accelerated (Subpart E) or Conditional Approval in US and EU, respectively, was presented to the FDA, EMA, and PDMA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P60_S3	Each agency provided separate concurrence on the willingness to consider proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint, with varying points of view on the degree of change in proteinuria to predict a treatment effect, and the timing for completion of enrollment of the post marketing confirmatory study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P60_S4	The BRIGHT-SC protocol has been amended to best address the recommendations of the FDA, EMA and PDMA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	In 2013, our licensor, Eli Lilly, gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a Phase 3 trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of liprotamase to respond to the FDA s 2011 complete response letter.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	The Phase 3 study (SOLUTION) is a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study intended to evaluate the non-inferiority of liprotamase compared with another commercially available PERT.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	The SOUTION design also addresses the 2005 EMA protocol assistance comments, which were consistent with the FDA s request for an active comparator trial.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	To date, four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two Phase 1 dose-ranging studies in which a total of 104 patients were enrolled by our licensor, Amgen, a Phase 2b double-blind placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical outcomes study in which 547 subjects were enrolled, and a Phase 2 Open-Label Extension study (OLE) which evaluated the long-term safety of blisibimod in subjects previously enrolled in the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study, both conducted by us.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	As expected for a BAFF inhibitor, statistically significant reductions in total B-cells were observed in patients treated with blisibimod compared with placebo in all three of the placebo-controlled studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	Based on positive results among 104 lupus patients in Amgen s Phase 1a and 1b clinical studies, we conducted the PEARL-SC study, a Phase 2b randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various subcutaneous doses of blisibimod in patients with seropositive lupus and active disease defined as SELENA-SLEDAI 6 at enrollment, which ran from mid-2010 to April 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	The study enrolled 547 patients in 11 countries at 72 clinical sites.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	All patients completed the PEARL-SC study when the final enrolled patient completed six months of therapy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	In June and July of 2012 we announced results from the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study, which we believe support the initiation of a differentiated Phase 3 registration plan utilizing a 200mg weekly dose of blisibimod in patients with active lupus, despite the concomitant use of corticosteroids.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	The primary endpoint of the PEARL-SC study was a clinical improvement at the lupus responder index, or SRI-5, at week 24 for the pooled blisibimod dose groups versus placebo groups.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	SRI-5 is defined as a five-point improvement in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new BILAG 1A or 2B scores, and no new increase in Physician s Global Assessment of more than 0.3 points.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	The primary endpoint of this study was not met due to the lack of efficacy in the two lowest dose groups.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S3	However, the primary endpoint SRI-5 responder rates were numerically higher in subjects receiving blisibimod 200mg weekly (QW) compared with pooled placebo, from Week 16 ( SRI 5 for blisibimod-placebo=8%, p= 0.14), through Week 24 ( SRI 5=8.2%, p=0.15), reaching statistical significance at Week 20 ( SRI 5=13.4%, p = 0.02).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S4	Treatment benefit was greater still when compared with the regimen-matched (QW) placebo.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S5	In pre-specified secondary analyses, benefit was observed at Week 24 with the 200mg QW group compared with matched placebo using modified SRI analyses in which responders attained SELENA-SLEDAI improvements of 7 or 8 ( SRI 5 = 8.7% p=0.23; SRI-7 =16.3% p=0.003; SRI-8 =17.4% p=0.001).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S6	Blisibimod was also effective in a subgroup of patients with severe lupus with baseline SELENA- SLEDAI 10 and receiving corticosteroids at any dose (n=278) utilizing more stringent response thresholds ( SRI-5=13.8%, p=0.18; SRI-6=15.9%, p=0.12; SRI-7=28.9%, p=0.002; SRI- 8=31.1%, p 0.001, Figure 5 and Table 1).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S7	Based on SELENA SLEDAI definitions, 76 subjects (13.9%) had renal involvement at baseline and 54 subjects had proteinuria equivalent 1g/24hr.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S8	Compared with baseline, decreases in proteinuria were observed with blisibimod from Week 12 through Week 52 in the subgroup of subjects with proteinuria equivalent 1 g/24hr at enrollment (Figure 6).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S9	Similarly, decreases in proteinuria were observed in subjects with proteinuria equivalent 0.5 g/24hr through Week 44.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P65_S10	Significantly greater reductions in proteinuria were also observed in a subgroup of subjects with active inflammation (i.e. low C3) and high anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Secondary endpoints included safety, improvements in variant forms of the SRI (e.g. defined by greater improvements in SELENA-SLEDAI), effects on clinical response in subgroup of patients with greater baseline disease severities, time to lupus disease flare, improvements in proteinuria, improvements in biomarkers of inflammation (e.g. anti-dsDNA, complement C3 and C4), and changes in B-cell counts.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	In June of 2012 we completed dosing in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Using a higher treatment threshold of an eight-point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI, or an SRI-8 endpoint, in this enhanced subgroup population, the 200mg blisibimod treatment group demonstrated a 15.6% treatment difference compared to pooled placebo (41.7% versus 26.1%, p 0.05) and 31.1% treatment difference compare to regimen-matched placebo (41.7% versus 10.6%, p 0.001) at 24 weeks.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	In this severe subgroup, separation of clinical response was evident as early as Week 8 and numerical improvements relative to placebo were maintained beyond Week 24.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	This severe subgroup is the population that we believe will benefit most from treatment with blisibimod, and is the population we are enrolling in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S3	Significant and early decreases in proteinuria were also observed with blisibimod as early as Week 8 in subjects with baseline proteinuria equivalent 1g/24 hrs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S4	All doses of blisibimod demonstrated consistent serological response including reductions of B-cells, double-stranded-DNA antibodies and improvement in complement levels.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S5	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S6	In addition to publications in earlier abstracts at key international rheumatology conferences, the efficacy and safety data from the PEARL-SC study were published by Dr Richard Furie and colleagues ( Ann Rheum Dis . 2014).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P68_S7	The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file or furnish with the SEC .
1316175_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	In Figure 5, an SRI-6 responder achieved all of the following: 6 point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, and no new BILAG 1A or 2B organ domain scores, and no worsening ( 0.3 increase) in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	In a subgroup analysis of patients with severe lupus disease (SELENA SLEDAI 10 and receiving steroid at baseline, n=278), the percent of subjects achieving the SRI-5 was higher in subjects receiving the highest dose of blisibimod (200mg QW) compared with placebo.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	The graph shows data for blisibimod (200mg QW) and regimen matched placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks (Furie et al., Ann Rheum Dis . 2014).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Analyses were conducted in the subgroup of subjects with more severe lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI score 10) at enrollment.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	SLE Responder Index (SRI) is defined as patients who respond to treatment and achieve a reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI equal to or greater than the number indicated, no new BILAG 1A or 2B organ domain scores, and no increase in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of greater than 0.3 on a three point scale.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	In subjects with baseline urinary protein excretion equivalent to 1-6g/24hrs, treatment with blisibimod resulted in significantly greater reductions in proteinuria compared to placebo from Week 8 through Week 24.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	Furthermore, the observed treatment-related decreases in proteinuria resulted in near normalization of the proteinuria to 1g/24hrs in those subjects receiving blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	The graph shows data from subgroups of patients defined by baseline proteinuria for blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	Separately, data are shown for the subgroup of subjects with high inflammatory biomarker status at enrollment, defined by low C3 and high anti-dsDNA autoantibodies at baseline.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	Data are plotted for all pooled blisibimod dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P74_S3	See data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the European League Against Rheumatology Annual Conference, Madrid, Spain 2013 in Figure 6.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	In this study, statistically significant reductions in total B-cells were observed in patients treated with blisibimod compared with placebo due to its mechanism of BAFF inhibition.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, treatment with blisibimod was associated with significant improvements in lupus disease activity and lupus biomarkers, including anti-dsDNA antibodies, proteinuria, immunoglobulins including IgG and IgM, and complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated in this study, with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events or infections compared with placebo (see Table 2 in the next section).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	The effects of blisibimod on patient-reported fatigue were evaluated in the PEARL-SC study using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale, and reported by Dr Michelle Petri at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, Boston MA, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	Improvements in patient self-reported fatigue were observed amongst subjects randomized to blisibimod based on the FACIT-Fatigue scale (Figure 7), especially in the 200mg QW group (N=80) where favorable effects of blisibimod compared with placebo were observed as early as Week 8, and a mean 6.9-point improvement from baseline was reported at Week 24 compared to 4.4 with placebo (N=229).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	These effects meet the criteria for minimal clinically-important improvement difference of 5.9 defined by Goligher and colleagues (2008) for patients with SLE.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	In order to evaluate longer-term safety of blisibimod, patients with lupus who completed the PEARL-SC study were able to participate in an OLE study in which they were treated with an active drug (blisibimod).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	The OLE study was opened in Q2 2012 and closed in Q2 2013 after subjects had completed a minimum of one year of continuous therapy with blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	Interim data from the combined PEARL-SC and OLE studies were presented at the 2013 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology and Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ACR/ARHP).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P77_S3	In addition, a case report was published summarizing observations in a patient who was randomized to placebo in the PEARL-SC study then experienced a rapid improvement in serum cryoglobulins upon initiation of blisibimod therapy in the OLE study (Golima et al., Rheumatology , 2013).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	The emerging data for the OLE study corroborate the effects of 24-week therapy with blisibimod observed in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	Specifically, the improvements in proteinuria observed in the subgroup of patients with abnormal proteinuria at enrollment (Figure 8), were maintained over 52 weeks of continuous blisibimod therapy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	In addition, the effects observed with blisibimod on peripheral B-cells, anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, and complement C3 and C4 and immunoglobulins IgG and IgM observed over 24 weeks of dosing in the PEARL-SC study were found to be durable over 52 weeks of therapy through the OLE study (Figures 8 and 9).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P78_S3	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels through the PEARL-SC and OLE studies, with no associated increase in risk of severe infection (Table 2).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	The data from the Phase 2 program with blisibimod support the ongoing exploration of blisibimod s efficacy and safety in the Phase 3 study in patients with lupus (CHABLIS-SC1) as well as the Phase 2 study in patients with IgA nephropathy (BRIGHT-SC1).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	Additional information for the OLE clinical studies can be found at http://www.anthera.com/pipeline/clinical-studies/past-studies/open-label-extension-study .html.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file or furnish with the SEC.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego 2013, in Figure 11, the significant improvements in proteinuria in patients with lupus randomized to blisibimod compared with placebo observed in the PEARL-SC study were found to be durable through their continuing exposure to blisibimod in the OLE study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	The graph shows data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial, and interim data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego 2013 in Figure 9, with its mechanism of BAFF inhibition, blisibimod treatment was associated with significant reductions in the numbers of total B-cells, anti-dsDNA antibodies, as well as significant increases in complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	The graphs shows data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial, and interim data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	According to data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego 2013 in Figure 10, significant reductions in immunoglobulins IgG and IgM were observed with blisibimod compared with placebo during the placebo-controlled PEARL-SC study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	These effects were found to be durable in subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	The effects on immunoglobulins were not associated with infection risk, nor were alterations in white blood cells, monocytes, or neutrophils associated with blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P83_S3	The graphs show data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once- weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC study, and interim data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	Prior to our in-licensing of blisibimod, our licensor, Amgen, completed two Phase 1 clinical studies of blisibimod in lupus patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of the drug using intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	The randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1a clinical study evaluated blisibimod as a single intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 56 lupus patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	Intravenous doses included 1, 3 and 6mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3mg/kg.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	Results from this clinical study indicated the safety and tolerability of blisibimod administered as a single intravenous or subcutaneous dose was comparable to placebo.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Single doses of blisibimod exhibited linear pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	There were comparable adverse events between the blisibimod and placebo groups with no deaths reported.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, no neutralization antibodies were seen across all doses.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	The most common adverse events were nausea (15%), headache (10%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%) and diarrhea (8%).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	Blisibimod was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study as an intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 63 lupus patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	The intravenous dose was 6mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	Patients received their doses of blisibimod or placebo once-weekly for four weeks.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S3	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S4	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod after multiple doses.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S5	Results showed that multiple doses of blisibimod exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S6	Further, results demonstrated a significant decrease in total B-cells as early as 15 days after beginning treatment, and total B-cell reduction (up to approximately 60-70% of baseline) reached its nadir after about 160 days of therapy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S7	By six months after beginning treatment, the B-cell populations had returned to baseline levels.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P88_S8	Further analyses of B-cell subsets found that na ve B-cells and activated B-cells were significantly decreased while memory B-cells were transiently significantly increased following treatment with blisibimod, consistent with a correction of the B-cell abnormalities reported in lupus patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	There were no deaths reported between the blisibimod and placebo groups.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	Few neutralization antibodies were seen, and all resolved in subsequent visits.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	Based on these results and published data from competitor studies, we conducted a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating blisibimod in lupus patients from the second half of 2010 to the third quarter of 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	Liprotamase was studied from 2002 to 2009 in seven clinical trials, in which a total of 492 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	Three Phase 1 trials were conducted, 1 in healthy volunteers and 2 in subjects with EPI due to CF.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	Two short-term trials, the Phase 2 Study TC 2A, and the Phase 3 Study 726 evaluated the efficacy of liprotamase in subjects 7 years of age with EPI due to CF.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P91_S3	Two long-term Phase 3 safety and tolerability trials were also conducted: Study 767 in subjects with EPI due to CF and Study 810 in subjects with EPI due to CP/pancreatectomy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	Completed clinical trials demonstrated that dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) absorption are significantly increased in patients with cystic fibrosis and EPI who received liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	In 2013, Eli Lilly gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a pivotal trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	The dose-ranging Phase 1 study TC-1B evaluated five dose levels across a 50-fold range, from 100-to-5000 units (U) per kg per meal in CF-EPI subjects.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	In this study, greater improvements in nutrients absorption, as measured using the percent change from baseline in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA), were observed at doses of 500 U per kg per meal and higher.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	Study TC-2A, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-finding trial, was conducted in 125 pediatric and adult subjects with CF-related EPI who were treated with liprotamase in one of three dosing regimens containing 6,500 U, 32,500 U, and 130,000 U lipase administered per meal or snack.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	Observed mean CFAs at the end of study were 56.2%, 67.0%, and 69.7% in the 6,500, 32,500, and 130,000 U dose groups, respectively (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0032) with significant improvements in mean changes from baseline (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0005).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	Pairwise comparison of the CFA values showed that statistically greater improvements were observed at the higher doses of liprotamase compared with the lowest dose of 6,500 U (Figure 14).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P95_S3	Similar improvements in the CNA, were observed with liprotamase at the two highest dose levels.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Study 726, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, parallel design, multinational clinical, evaluated the effects of a single capsule of liprotamase (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) or placebo administered with every meal or snack on severe EPI defined as baseline CFA 40% in the absence of PERT.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	There was a protocol-specified dose increase to two capsules per meal and one capsule per snack allowed in cases of involuntary weight loss, steatorrhea, or lack of weight gain.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P96_S2	Amongst the 138 subjects enrolled in this study, treatment with liprotamase resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in the CFA of 21.2% with liprotamase compared with 6.0% with placebo (p = 0.0011, Figure 15).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	Two long-term studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and effects on nutritional status of liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	Study 810 evaluated adult subjects with EPI due to CP or after pancreatectomy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	Amongst the 214 subjects who were treated, an average dose of 5.5 capsules (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) of liprotamase per day maintained nutritional status as assessed by serial measurement of height and weight, including age-appropriate growth and weight gain in children.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P98_S1	Mean BMI z-scores for subjects in Study 767 were maintained over time on study (mean BMI z-score at baseline, Months 3, 6, and 12 were -0.503,-0.637, -0.688, and -0.655, respectively).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	Since our inception in 2004, we have focused primarily on developing our product candidates, blisibimod, liprotamase, varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	The two latter product candidates were terminated in March 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	We currently focus our development efforts on blisibimod, which is being developed for autoimmune disease, including lupus and IgA nephropathy, and liprotamase, as an enzyme replacement therapy for EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P99_S3	In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred $21.8 million, $21.7 million and $49.2 million, respectively, of research and development expense.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	In December 2014, we entered in an exclusive license agreement with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd ( Zenyaku ) for the development and commercialization of blisibimod in Japan and potentially other countries throughout Asia ( the Zenyaku Agreement ).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	We retain full development and commercialization rights of blisibimod for all other global territories including North America and the European Union and we are actively pursuing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to develop and commercialize blisibimod in these territories.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including autoimmune diseases and enzyme replacement therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	We are advancing the development of blisibimod to evaluate the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P102_S1	We have completed a Phase 2b clinical study with blisibimod in patients with lupus and plan to continue the advancement of blisibimod in our ongoing Phase 3 registration program in lupus and development in IgA nephropathy in 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P102_S2	We intend to initiate the development of liprotamase in a Phase 3 registration program in the second half of 2015 in patients with cystic fibrosis-related Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P102_S3	We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of blisibimod in lupus or for the development of liprotamase, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	Our product candidates are focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as rheumatologists, nephrologists and cystic fibrosis specialists.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P103_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P103_S2	In other chronic indications, we intend to seek commercial collaborations with companies that have a large, dedicated sales force focused on general practitioners and we plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non- specialty and international markets.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P104_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institution.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P104_S2	Our primary competitors are described in further detail below, under Approved Categories of Drugs and B-Cell Targeting Drugs Under Late-Stage Clinical Development .
1316175_15_ITEM1_P104_S3	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P105_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P105_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P105_S4	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and partner GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) obtained FDA approval for Benlysta (belimumab) in 2011 for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P106_S1	Benlysta , the first novel therapy approved in the last 50 years, was acquired by GSK in July 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	Other current therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, corticosteroids, anti-malarials and immunosuppressants generally act to hold back broadly the proliferation of many types of cells, including white blood cells.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	However, use of these agents is often associated with limited efficacy or significant adverse events and broad immune suppression.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	Emerging data from 2 large Phase 3 trials with the BAFF-targeted monocloncal antibody, tabalumab, were presented by Professor David Isenberg at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, Boston, MA, November 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	These data demonstrate that targeting BAFF remains an effective strategy for improving chronic disease activity in SLE.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P108_S2	Several other agents under development target other B-cell related pathways or other inflammatory mechanisms for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P108_S3	These product candidates include atacicept, or TACI-Ig, from ZymoGenetics Inc. and epratuzumab from Immunomedics, Inc.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P108_S4	Other pathways targeting both B-cell and non-B-cell mechanisms are in earlier-phase clinical trials, such as Lupuzor from ImmuPharma plc; anti-inhibitors of interferon (IFN) alpha, sifalimumab, MEDI-545 and rontalizumab; the anti-IFN gamma antibody AMG 811; toll-like receptor inhibitors; the anti-interleukin 6 antibodies sirukumab and PF-04236921; the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor CC-10004; the anti-CD74 monocloncal antibody milatuzumab; and inhibition of B7 related protein (B7RP-1) pathway with AMG 557.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P108_S5	We believe that blisibimod may offer potential differentiation from these agents, including demonstrated dosing flexibility with both subcutaneous and intravenous delivery; selective modulation and reduction of relevant B-cell types in lupus patients; the ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF; the use of a bacterial expression platform which is expected to translate to lower manufacturing costs compared with therapeutic antibodies; and distinct patent protection based on a novel and proprietary technology developed and commercialized by Amgen.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis, including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pertzye by Cornestone Therapeutics, Inc., and Ultresa and Zenpep by Aptalis Pharma US.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P109_S1	We are also aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: Johnson and Johnson Research and Development LLC recently completed a Phase 3 study to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral pancrelipase MT in the treatment of adult and pediatric/adolescent cystic fibrosis patients with clinical symptoms of EPI; and Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH Co. KG s compound, Burlulipase, is being tested in a Phase 3 study in patients with EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P110_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	As of the date of this report, our blisibimod patent portfolio includes:
1316175_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	Three pending non-EP foreign patent applications in Brazil, Mexico, and Poland.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Amgen to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P115_S1	In addition, we hold a non-exclusive worldwide license to one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, one pending EP patent application, and over 50 non-EP foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to general peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022, March 2023 and November 2023.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P117_S1	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P117_S2	This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to as late as May 2027, March 2028 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P117_S3	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P117_S4	The exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P117_S5	One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P118_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P118_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P118_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P118_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P119_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P119_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P120_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P120_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P120_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P121_S0	We are aware of two families of third-party U.S. patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P121_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P121_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P121_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P121_S4	If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and possibly requiring us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P121_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P122_S0	As of the date of this report, our liprotomase portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly, including:
1316175_15_ITEM1_P123_S0	One pending non-EP foreign patent application.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Eli Lilly to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S1	The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in March 2025 and July 2028.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S2	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of liprotamase, the latter of these U.S. patents may be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S3	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S4	This could extend the expiration date of this U.S. Patent to as late as July 2033, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S5	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S6	Two of the exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in February 2021 and October 2025.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P124_S7	One of these two patents may be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to February 2026 or October 2030.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P125_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009 and November 2014 (as amended, the Amgen Agreement ), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	Under the Amgen Agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing blisibimod, as well as the right to grant sublicenses.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P126_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P126_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P126_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P127_S1	Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than blisibimod that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Agreement, we have paid $6.0 million in license fees to Amgen for blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P128_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States, European Union or Japan.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P128_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P128_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P128_S4	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P129_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	In connection with the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku, we amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of our collaboration with Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by us to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P130_S1	Under this amendment, we also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of our common stock equal $1,000,000 divided by the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P130_S2	We issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015 pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	On July 11, 2014, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly (the Lilly Agreement ), to develop and commercialize liprotamase, a Phase 3 novel investigational PERT for the treatment of patients with EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P131_S1	Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we were not required to make any up-front payment but we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P131_S2	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P131_S3	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	On December 11, 2014, we entered into the Zenyaku Agreement with Zenyaku, pursuant to which we granted Zenyaku an exclusive license to certain patent rights, know-how and other intellectual property relating to blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	Under the agreement, Zenyaku obtained exclusive rights to develop, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import blisibimod and any related products containing any of blisibimod s binding domains, including but not limited to any pegylated (or otherwise chemically modified) blisibimod in Japan.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P133_S1	Zenyaku also obtained certain rights to grant sublicenses and an option to expand the territory of the license to include China (including Hong Kong), Singapore, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and South Korea.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P133_S2	The licensed patent rights include all patents controlled by us or our affiliates relating to blisibimod, including those licensed to us under the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P133_S3	We retained the right to practice and grant licenses relating to blisibimod technology in all areas outside of the licensed territory, to manufacture and have manufactured compounds and products relating to blisibimod anywhere in the world and to conduct or have conducted clinical trials and other studies of compounds and products relating to blisibimod anywhere in the world.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P134_S0	The development activities of both us and Zenyaku are overseen by a joint development committee.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P135_S0	Under the terms of the Zenyaku Agreement, Zenyaku assumed sole responsibility for the sale, marketing, promotion and commercialization of products relating to blisibimod in the licensed territory, and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to market, promote, sell and commercialize licensed products in such territory.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P136_S0	Zenyaku is also responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs and will reimburse us for i) 100% of blisibimod development cost in Japan; ii) a percentage of global blisibimod development cost outside of Japan; and iii) exclusive purchase of blisibimod clinical drug supplies at cost and blisibimod commercial drug products at a premium from us.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P136_S1	Additionally, Zenyaku is obligated to make milestone payments of up to $22.0 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P137_S0	Pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Zenyaku, dated December 11, 2014, under which we were entitled to require Zenyaku to purchase up to $7.0 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to 1.3 times the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 trading days prior to the delivery of the closing notice (the Premium Purchase Price ).
1316175_15_ITEM1_P137_S1	We delivered the closing notice and entered into a subscription agreement with Zenyaku on January 27, 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P137_S2	We issued 2,795,895 shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to $2.50367 to Zenyaku in exchange for $7.0 million in cash.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P137_S3	Pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement, we may also require Zenyaku to purchase up to an additional $8.0 million of shares of our common stock at the Premium Purchase Price in quarterly installments of no more than $2.0 million during the period from June 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P137_S4	Additionally, prior to May 31, 2016, we may sell $4.0 million of shares of our common stock to Zenyaku should Zenyaku elects to exercise their option for the Additional Asian Countries.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P137_S5	All sales under the stock purchase agreement are subject to the condition that Zenyaku will not at any time be obligated to purchase such number of shares of common stock that would result in Zenyaku being the beneficial owner of more than 15% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P138_S0	Pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement, we intend to enter into a loan agreement with Zenyaku for an aggregate principal amount of $7.0 million, of which $5.0 million, together with interest thereon, is forgivable upon certain achievement of the primary endpoint identified in the first Phase 3 Study for blisibimod to treat IgA nephropathy and the remaining $2.0 million, together with interest thereon, is forgivable upon the submission of the first Biologics License Application for blisibimod in the licensed territory.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P138_S1	In exchange, we intend to issue a Secured Promissory Note to Zenyaku, to be secured by certain information and material necessary for the manufacture of blisibimod, with a maturity date of December 11, 2021 and an accrued interest of 1% per annum.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P138_S2	The Promissory Note is planned for execution in the first half of 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P139_S0	Zenyaku may terminate the agreement at will or in the event annual sales of generic drug containing blisibimod reach 50% of annual sales of the drug resulting from this collaboration in Japan and other potential Asian countries.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P139_S1	If the agreement is not terminated early, Zenyaku may continue to obtain clinical/commercial drug supplies from Anthera after such expiration for three (3) years from providing a written notice to discontinue such supplies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P139_S2	Either party may terminate the agreement if a party materially breaches the agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P139_S3	In addition, Anthera may terminate the agreement if Zenyaku challenges any Anthera patent.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P139_S4	Upon expiration (but not earlier termination), Zenyaku may retain the licensed patent on a fully-paid and royalty free (subject to the Amgen royalty and any third party payments), irrevocable and perpetual basis.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P139_S5	Upon termination due to material breach by Anthera, Zenyaku is entitled to retain all license rights; however, is still obligated to pay the milestone payments to us, royalty payment to Amgen and any third party payments.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P139_S6	Upon termination due to material breach or at will by Zenyaku, all license rights granted to Zenyaku automatically terminate.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P140_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current GMP with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P140_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P140_S2	Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce product candidates provide us with faulty products or such products are later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P141_S0	Our contract manufacturers obtain the raw materials for the drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies from a variety of sources.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P141_S1	We believe that this will provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials and drug product to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P141_S2	We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical systems, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P142_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P142_S1	Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P142_S2	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by local, state and federal regulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P143_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P143_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P143_S2	In order to commercialize our product candidates, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P143_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidates alone.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P143_S4	In therapeutic areas that require a large sales force selling to a large and diverse prescribing population, we currently plan to partner with third parties to commercialize our product candidates while retaining rights to co-promote our products to a select audience of high prescribing physicians in the United States, thereby supplementing or enhancing the efforts of a commercial partner.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P143_S5	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in non-specialty and international markets.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P144_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidate to market alone or in collaboration with a co-development or co- promotion partner.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P144_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P144_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P145_S0	Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P145_S1	Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process, and our biological product candidate, blisibimod, must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P146_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P146_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P146_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P146_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P147_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_15_ITEM1_P148_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P149_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S4	Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S5	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S6	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P150_S7	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P151_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P151_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P151_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P151_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P151_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P151_S5	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P152_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_15_ITEM1_P153_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P153_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P154_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P155_S0	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P155_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P156_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P156_S1	Safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 days after the sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator s brochure.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P156_S2	A sponsor also must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 days after the sponsor s receipt of the information.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P156_S3	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P156_S4	The FDA , a data safety monitoring board, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P156_S5	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P157_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P157_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidates and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P157_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P158_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P158_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P159_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P159_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P159_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P160_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P160_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P160_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P160_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P161_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P161_S1	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP- compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P161_S2	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P162_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P162_S1	The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P162_S2	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P162_S3	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P162_S4	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P163_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P163_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P163_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P163_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P163_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P163_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P163_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P164_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P164_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P164_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P165_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P165_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P165_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P165_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P165_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P165_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P165_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P166_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S6	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P167_S7	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P168_S0	HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P168_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P168_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P169_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P169_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P169_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P170_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P170_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P170_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P170_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P171_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P171_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P171_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if any of our product candidates is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P171_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P172_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P172_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P173_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P173_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P174_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P174_S1	Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P175_S0	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P175_S1	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P176_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P176_S1	A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P176_S2	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P176_S3	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P177_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well- controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P177_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P177_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P178_S0	The FDA Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA includes a provision that allows sponsors to request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P178_S1	The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P178_S2	The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable, (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P179_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record- keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P180_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P180_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P180_S2	Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P180_S3	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P181_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P181_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P181_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P182_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P182_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P183_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P183_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P184_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P184_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P184_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P185_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P186_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P186_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P187_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P187_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P187_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P187_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P188_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P188_S1	European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P189_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P189_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P189_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P190_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P190_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P190_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P190_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P190_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including, at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S3	However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S6	Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S7	It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P191_S8	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P192_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P192_S1	For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P192_S2	Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P192_S3	Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P192_S4	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P192_S5	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P192_S6	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P193_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P193_S1	Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P193_S2	Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P193_S3	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P193_S4	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P193_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P193_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P194_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P194_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P194_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P194_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P195_S0	There are also laws that govern a company s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P195_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company s ability to operate its business.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P196_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P196_S1	We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P196_S2	Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P196_S3	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P196_S4	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P196_S5	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P197_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P198_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P199_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P200_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P200_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P200_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P200_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P200_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P200_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P201_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had 20 employees.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P201_S1	All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P201_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P202_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P202_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P202_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P203_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware in 2004.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P203_S1	T he mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P204_S0	Through a link on the Investors section of our website (under SEC Filings in the Financial Information section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_15_ITEM1_P204_S1	Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Since our inception in 2004, we have focused primarily on developing three of our product candidates, blisibimod, varespladib and varespladib sodium.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The two latter product candidates were terminated in March 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In July 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to a Phase 3, novel investigational PERT, liprotamase, intended for the treatment of EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have financed our operations exclusively through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, and debt financings and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in September 2004.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Substantially all of our losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We expect to incur additional losses over the next several years, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate revenues.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have never generated any product revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct preclinical tests in animals and clinical studies in human beings, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We have not generated any revenue from our development-stage product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Currently, we have one product candidate in clinical development, which is blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our second product candidate, liprotamase, which we acquired from Eli Lilly in July 2014, is planned for a Phase 3 pivotal trial in the United States and Europe in 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our product candidates could fail in clinical studies if we are unable to demonstrate that it is effective or if it causes unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Failure of our product candidates in clinical studies would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our future capital requirements could be substantial and will depend on many factors including:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As of the date of this report, we anticipate that our existing cash, anticipated equity investment and loan proceeds from Zenyaku, partial reimbursement of global blisibimod development expenses from Zenyaku, and access to additional capital through an equity purchase agreement are sufficient to fund our near term liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	terminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for sale.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to our licensors is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In December 2007, we entered into the Amgen Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low teens as net sales increase.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In July 2014, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Pursuant to the Lilly Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives for any liprotamase formulation.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We are also required to make tiered royalty payments on net sales, which percentage increases from the high single digits to the mid-teens as net sales increase.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to our licensors is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of our product candidates, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and in the event we are unable to meet our debt obligations, the lenders could foreclose on our assets.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As a part of our financing strategy, we have in the past and we may in the future enter into credit agreements with lenders.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In connection with these credit agreements, our debt obligations to the lenders could:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors who are not similarly restricted.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may be required to pledge substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under credit agreements in the future.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In the event that we were to fail to make any required payment under any credit agreement, or fail to comply with the covenants contained in the any credit agreement and other related agreements, we may be in default regarding that indebtedness.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	A debt default would enable the lender to foreclose on the assets securing such debt and could significantly diminish the market value and marketability of our common stock and could result in the acceleration of the payment obligations under all or a portion of our consolidated indebtedness.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, conducting product development activities for our primary product candidates, blisibimod, liprotamase, varespladib and varespladib sodium (the two latter product candidates were terminated in March 2012), and performing research and development.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our product candidates which are still under clinical development.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well- controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidates are safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until the U.S. FDA approves our biologics license applications, or BLAs, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have not submitted any BLA or received marketing approval for our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the U.S. FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The U.S. FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	From time to time during the regulatory approval process of our product candidates, we engage in discussions with the U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We may receive informal verbal and or written guidance from these authority agencies which may help form the basis of our clinical trial designs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory agencies may change their position on such informal guidance prior to the approval of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	As a result, we are unable to determine whether the outcome of informal deliberations will become final.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with inquires and requests from the U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value maybe be reduced.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospect.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the U.S. FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Product development costs to us will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidates or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delays outside our control.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical development plans or clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for re- examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidates, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidates have performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain U.S. FDA approval for our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We depend on continuing our current collaboration and developing additional collaboration to develop and commercialize our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our strategy for fully developing and commercializing our products is dependent upon maintaining our current arrangements and establishing new arrangements with research collaborators, corporate collaborators and others.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We have a collaboration agreement with Zenyaku, which provides for, among other things, significant future payments should certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones be achieved.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Under the collaborative arrangement, Zenyaku is responsible for:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Because we expect to rely heavily on our Zenyaku and to enter into new collaborations in the future, the development and commercialization of our programs would be substantially delayed, and our ability to receive future funding would be substantially impaired if our current or future collaborators:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	merged with a third party that wants to terminate the collaboration.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	These issues and possible disagreements with current or future corporate collaborators could lead to delays in the collaborative research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Furthermore, disagreements with these parties could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If any of these issues arise, it may delay the development and commercialization of drug candidates and, ultimately, our generation of product revenues.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We do not and will not have access to all information regarding the product candidate we licensed to Zenyaku.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We do not and will not have access to all information regarding the products being developed and potentially commercialized by Zenyaku, including potentially material information about clinical trial design and execution, safety reports from clinical trials, spontaneous safety reports if a product candidate is later approved and marketed, regulatory affairs, marketing and other areas known by Zenyaku.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, we have confidentiality obligations under our agreement with Zenyaku.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Thus, our ability to keep our shareholders informed about the status of product candidate under our collaboration with Zenyaku will be limited by the degree to which Zenyaku keeps us informed and allows us to disclose such information to the public.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If Zenyaku fails to keep us informed about the clinical development and regulatory approval of our collaboration and product candidate licensed to it, we may make operational and investment decisions that we would not have made had we been fully informed, which may materially and adversely affect our business and operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If we breach the license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are party to the Amgen Agreement, which provides for the exclusive worldwide licenses of the compositions of matter and methods of use for blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive worldwide licenses of compositions of matter and methods of use relating to peptibodies generally.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In December 2014, we became a party to the Zenyaku Agreement as a result of us out-licensing the rights to blisibimod in Japan.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We are also party to the Lilly Agreement, which provides for an exclusive worldwide license of the compositions of matters and methods of use for liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	These agreements require us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify our licensors under the terms of the agreements.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors may terminate our licenses and may be able to re-obtain licensed technologies and aspects of any intellectual properties controlled by us that relate to the licensed technologies that originated from our licensors.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of the licensed product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreements.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents and patent applications licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the license agreements could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The market for inflammatory disease therapeutics is especially large and competitive.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	For lupus, GlaxoSmithKline plc s BAFF antagonist monoclonal antibody, Benlysta , was approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of lupus.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Further, we are aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of lupus: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Merck Serono S.A., whose dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist fusion protein, Atacicept, recently completed a Phase 2/3 clinical study for lupus; Immunomedics, Inc. and UCB S.A., who reported favorable results for their CD-22 antagonist humanized antibody, epratuzumab, in a Phase 2b clinical study in lupus, is now conducting two Phase 3 clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, other companies including Janssen, Medimmune, Pfizer, have completed Phase 2 trials in lupus and may be considering further clinical development.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The market for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is also highly competitive.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis, including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pertzye by Cornestone Therapeutics, Inc., and Ultresa and Zenpep by Aptalis Pharma US.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We are also aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: Johnson and Johnson Research and Development LLC recently completed a Phase 3 study to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral pancrelipase MT in the treatment of adult and pediatric/adolescent cystic fibrosis patients with clinical symptoms of EPI; and Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH Co. KG s compound, Burlulipase, is being tested in a Phase 3 study in patients with EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, and in obtaining U.S. FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining U.S. FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidates we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P54_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Phase 2 clinical studies conducted by us with blisibimod have generated differences in adverse effects and serious adverse events.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The most common adverse effects seen with our product candidates versus placebo include injection site erythema and nasopharyngitis.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The most common serious adverse events seen with blisibimod include Herpes zoster, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis, intervertebral disc protrusion, spontaneous abortion, and kidney stones.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S4	During the placebo-controlled Phase 2 PEARL study, blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events or infections between blisibimod and placebo.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Discontinuation due to adverse event was lower amongst blisibimod-treated subjects (5.7%) compared to placebo (7.9%).
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Amongst the commonly-reported adverse events, imbalance was observed only with injection site reactions (200mg QW blisibimod = 15%, matched placebo = 7%), but these were not serious or severe and did not result in discontinuation of treatment.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P56_S7	Studies conducted by our licensor on liprotamase have generated the following common adverse effects: general gastrointestinal disorder, such as abdominal pain, flatulence, loose stools and diarrhea.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our second product candidate, liprotamase, which we licensed from Eli Lilly in July 2014, received a complete response letter ( CRL ) from the U.S. FDA while it was under development by Eli Lilly in April 2011.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Eli Lilly addressed most of the material items highlighted by the FDA and worked directly with the U.S. FDA on a registration path for liprotamase which, if successful, could result in regulatory approval of liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	There are still open items from the CRL that we will need to address with the U.S. FDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	While we plan to make reasonable efforts to accommodate and address the U.S. FDA s inquires and request, we are unable to determine the final outcome of the CRL.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Any delay in addressing the CRL to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA may result in postponement of our Phase 3 clinical trial of liprotamase in patients with EPI.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If serious adverse events that are considered related to our product candidates are observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Further, if our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidates and could substantially increase the costs of commercialization.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from the product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize any product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidate.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we develop.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in U.S. FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and U.S. FDA regulatory review.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the U.S. FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	For example, the label ultimately approved for blisibimod or liprotamase, if any, may include restrictions on use.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Further, the U.S. FDA has indicated that long-term safety data on blisibimod may need to be obtained as a post-market requirement.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing U.S. FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P64_S4	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P64_S5	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with our product candidates, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the products are manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the products, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the products from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P64_S6	If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	New legal and regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain approvals for our product candidates and could limit or make more burdensome our ability to commercialize any approved products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	New federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	New legislation, and the additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidates, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	If our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from their sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The degree of market acceptance of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third- party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Paul F. Truex, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Colin Hislop, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Debra Odink, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, and Ms. Klara Eason-Dickinson, our Chief Regulatory Officer, and the other principal members of our executive team.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P74_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P79_S2	We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for any product we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Also in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P80_S3	As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P80_S4	These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third- party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, the Health Care Reform Law and additional prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P82_S4	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the EU and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The use of product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P86_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	decreased demand for product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P88_S2	If and when we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P91_S3	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P94_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P94_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P94_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P94_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates or market them.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P97_S1	In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P97_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the U.S. FDA to withdraw approvals previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce drug product for our clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	There are a small number of suppliers, and in some instances, a single supplier for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture drug product.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P98_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P98_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of product candidates to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of product candidates or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P98_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained, the commercial launch would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of such product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P99_S1	If we successfully commercialize a product candidate, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P99_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P99_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, which may not occur on a timely basis.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Some of our manufacturing suppliers are located overseas, and the transportation of drug supplies to or from these facilities to their intended destinations is subject to certain risks of loss and damage beyond our control.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Additionally, the importation of drug supplies into the from foreign countries is subject to customs regulations that may require us to incur additional regulatory costs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the U.S. FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P102_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P102_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P102_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	G uidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P104_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P104_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	If our or our licensors patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidates or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We hold license rights to numerous U.S. European Patents ( EP ), and non-EP foreign patents and patent applications relating to blisibimod and liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Our blisibimod portfolio is made up of exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen, Inc.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P106_S2	Our liprotomase portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We also own several U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications relating to our terminated varespladib sodium/varespladib programs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	These patents and patent applications include both patents and patent applications originally filed by Anthera and patents assigned to Anthera by Eli Lilly or Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P107_S2	Our varespladib sodium/varespladib portfolio previously included a larger set of patents and patent applications relating to sPLA-2 inhibiting compounds and exclusively licensed from Eli Lilly and Shionogi Co., Ltd.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P107_S3	In August 2012, we provided notice of termination to our collaborators to terminate the license agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P107_S4	The license agreement was effectively terminated in November 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P107_S5	Due to termination of the varespladib programs, we do not expect to incur further payments to our collaborators under the license agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P108_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P111_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We are aware of two families of third party United States patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P114_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P114_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P114_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P114_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P116_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P116_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P116_S3	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P116_S4	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P116_S5	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P116_S6	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P117_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P118_S0	We are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the novel BAFF inhibitor blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P118_S1	We are also a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize liprotamase, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to liprotamase compositions and formulations.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering blisibimod and liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P119_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P119_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P119_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P119_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P119_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P120_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P120_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P120_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P121_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and to obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P122_S0	The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in the regulatory approval process.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Assuming we gain a five-year patent term extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2027 or 2028.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P123_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Assuming we gain such a five-year extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s European new chemical entity patents until 2027.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P123_S2	Further, since blisibimod has not been previously approved, blisibimod could be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity from the U.S. FDA.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P123_S3	During the data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small molecule compound or biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that compound or biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P124_S1	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P124_S2	However, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P124_S3	If we fail to receive such Hatch-Waxman extensions or marketing exclusivity rights or if we receive extensions that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P125_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P126_S0	We typically develop product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P126_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P126_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P127_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P127_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P128_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P128_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P128_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P128_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P129_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P129_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P131_S1	If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidates and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P132_S1	Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P132_S2	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P132_S3	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors existing or future patents.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P134_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P135_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P135_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P137_S0	The market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P137_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P138_S0	discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P139_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P139_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P139_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P139_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P139_S5	These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P140_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P140_S1	We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P140_S2	Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention from our business.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Because a small number of our existing stockholders own a material amount of our voting stock, your ability to influence corporate matters will be limited.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 25.59% of our outstanding common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P142_S1	As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to influence our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P142_S2	These persons will also have the ability to influence our management and business affairs.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P142_S3	This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P144_S0	As of December 31, 2014, there were 23,005,209 shares of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P144_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding options, restricted stock units and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock of 3,579,744 that, if exercised or released, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P144_S2	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P144_S3	Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P144_S4	Moreover, certain holders of shares of common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P145_S0	We have registered or will register all common stock that we may issue under our 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan ), our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan ) and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P145_S1	As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 252,904 shares of our common stock had been reserved for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, plus any shares cancelled under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Plan, and an aggregate of 85,123 shares had been reserved for future issuance under our ESPP.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P145_S2	These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P145_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P146_S0	In addition, we may sell shares of stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement with LPC executed in March 2015, pursuant to which we have the right, but not obligations, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of common stock over a period of two years.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P146_S1	We may also sell shares of stock pursuant to a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen ) to create an at-the-market equity program ( ATM ) under which we may from time to time offer and sell up to $25.0 million shares of our common stock, $3.7 million of which remained available to be sold as of the date of this report.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P146_S2	Finally, we maintain an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC for the issuance and sale from time to time of up to approximately $56.7 million of our equity and debt securities.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P147_S0	We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We will need to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P148_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P149_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P151_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P151_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P151_S2	For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P151_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P152_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P152_S1	We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P152_S2	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P152_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P153_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P154_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P154_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P154_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P156_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P157_S0	the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P158_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P158_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P158_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P160_S1	An ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P160_S2	We incurred an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 ownership of the Internal Revenue Code during 2012 and as such, our net operating loss carryforward are limited.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P160_S3	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_15_ITEM1A_P160_S4	If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We occupy approximately 14,000 square feet under a facility lease agreement that expires in September 2017.
1316175_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe our existing facility is adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not subject to any material pending legal proceedings.
1316175_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol ANTH since our initial public offering ( IPO ).
1316175_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that offering, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Market:
1316175_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 23,005,209 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by 24 holders of record and beneficial holders, based on information provided by the Company s transfer agent.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	A significantly larger number of stockholders may be "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P2_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III, Item 12 of this report.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	All information under this Item has been previously reported on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC.
1316175_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	We did not repurchase any securities during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables reflect selected consolidated summary financial data for each of the last five fiscal years and are derived from our audited financial statements.
1316175_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	This data should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Excluded weighted-average shares of unvested stock for 2010 of 5,956, for 2011 of 1,671 and for 2012 of 137.
1316175_15_ITEM6_P2_S1	These shares were subject to a risk of repurchase by the Company until such shares are vested.
1316175_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Net loss per basic and diluted share and weighted average shares used in net loss per basic and diluted share have been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split effectuated by the Company on July 15, 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs .
1316175_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our first Phase 3 product candidate, blisibimod, targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our second Phase 3 product candidate, liprotamase, is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	In December 2014, we entered in an exclusive license agreement with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd ( Zenyaku ) for the development and commercialization of blisibimod in Japan and potentially other countries throughout Asia.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We retain full development and commercialization rights of blisibimod for all other global territories including North America and the European Union and we are actively pursuing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to develop and commercialize blisibimod in these territories.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	In the third quarter of 2012 at an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we presented the results of the PEARL-SC clinical study and our plans for Phase 3 registration studies in patients with active lupus.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	As a result of this meeting we initiated patient enrollment in the initial Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 study in March 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	CHABLIS-SC1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with seropositive, clinically-active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard-of-care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The study is currently enrolling in 12 countries across Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	The study plans to randomize up to 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo in addition to their standard-of-care medication for 52 weeks.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	We expect to complete enrollment in mid-2015 and receive topline data after the last enrolled patient completes 52 weeks of treatment in mid-2016.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	The primary endpoint of the CHABLIS-SC1 will be clinical improvement in the SRI-6 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	Key secondary outcomes from the study, including SRI-8, reduction in the number of lupus flares and steroid use, are intended to further differentiate blisibimod from currently available therapies.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S6	To date, enrolled patient demographics and disease characteristics for the CHABLIS-SC1 study are consistent with our goal to enroll patients with higher levels of lupus activity and positive biomarkers despite the stable use of corticosteroids.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P8_S7	These characteristics were associated with improved outcomes in both our previous Phase 2 clinical study as well as in two large Phase 3 studies conducted with another BAFF-inhibitors, belimumab (Benlysta) and, more recently, tabalumab.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	In February, an interim analysis of CHABLIS-SC1 was conducted by an independent un-blinded statistician, who evaluated at a pre-specified time point, the proportion of responders to the systemic lupus erythematous SRI-6 responder index, and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	This futility analysis was not intended to provide any rules for stopping for overwhelming efficacy, change in study sample size, or alteration of the study design.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Rather, the analysis suggests that the observed data conforms with the assumptions upon which the trial was designed.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The systemic lupus erythematosus response index is a recognized endpoint by the FDA for previously approved therapeutics.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Prior to the interim analysis and in response to input from our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluated the published clinical data from other recent lupus studies with BAFF inhibitors, we modified the primary endpoint of CHABLIS-SC1 from a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-8 responder index to a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-6 composite responder index (previously a secondary endpoint of the study).
1316175_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	The available data suggests an improved consistency of the SRI-6 endpoint across multiple trials .
1316175_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Response rates to the SRI-8 responder index will remain a key secondary endpoint of the study.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	In addition to serving as a registration study for a potential lupus indication, observations in this study are intended to be included in marketing applications for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy and other indications.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	In the first quarter of 2014, we submitted the final protocol to the FDA for our second lupus registration study, CHABLIS-SC2.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The study design of CHABLIS-SC2 study is being discussed with a panel of clinical experts.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	We plan to finalize the design and meet with regulatory agencies in the second half of 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	These two pivotal studies are anticipated to form the basis of submission for blisibimod as treatment for active SLE that is not controlled by current best practice standard of care, including the use of steroids.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The BRIGHT-SC study is a Phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	We intend to enroll up to 200 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy who have proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr) and are receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	We initiated our BRIGHT-SC study in the second quarter of 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	The BRIGHT-SC clinical study is currently recruiting patients primarily in Southeast Asia.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	We intend to expand the study in the EU and Latin America in 2015 with the goal to complete enrollment by the first half of 2016.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P12_S6	We plan to conduct an interim futility analysis in the first quarter of 2015 to determine the effect of blisibimod on proteinuria after a minimum of eight weeks of treatment.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	In September 2013, we met with the U.S. FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as an endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	In this meeting we gained the PMDA s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan and have amended the BRIGHT-SC study to include the specific data requirements of the PMDA.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	We reached an agreement with the EMA on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable as well as the requirement for a single study in support of a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application ( CMAA ) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study, would be available post approval.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	The EMA also recommended the protocol to provide information on the recommended duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P13_S6	The BRIGHT SC protocol will be amended to reflect these recommendations from the EMA, along with other recommendations from the FDA and PMDA.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates, and since inception we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt and debt financings, raising net proceeds of approximately $335.9 million.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P14_S5	In addition to the normal risks associated with drug development companies, we may never successfully complete development of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P14_S6	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	We expect to recognize collaboration revenue from our collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku beginning in 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	We will amortize any license fee from the collaborative arrangement over the period of performance (product development period) and record any development cost reimbursement as a reduction to research and development expense.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	We will periodically review and, if necessary, revise the estimated period of performance of our collaboration.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidates development programs.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: licensing, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for the continued development of blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	We are developing our product candidates in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project, but rather are allocated across our clinical stage programs.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Included non-cash license fee $1.0 million in connection with an amendment to the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Included refund of $0.5 million from a vendor for our VISTA-16 clinical study, which was terminated in March 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	We intend to fund our clinical studies with existing cash and proceeds from potential future debt and equity offerings.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	As we obtain results from clinical studies, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain clinical development programs in order to focus our resources on more promising clinical development programs.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	Completion of clinical studies may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	The cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including:
1316175_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P25_S5	If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	None of our product candidates has received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions, including clinical, chemical manufacturing, regulatory, finance and business development.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, we believe that the following accounting policy is the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We expect to start recognizing collaboration revenue in 2015 after we complete the initial technology transfer of blisibimod to our collaborative partner, Zenyaku, pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We will recognize revenue in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 605 Revenue Recognition , subtopic ASC 605-25 Revenue with Multiple Element Arrangements and subtopic ASC 605-28 Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method , which provide accounting guidance for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and guidance on defining the milestone and determining when the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions is appropriate, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our collaboration with Zenyaku provides for various types of payments to us, including development milestones, sales milestone, royalty, and reimbursement for a portion of the Company s internal and external costs.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	We will recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Reimbursement for the Company s external costs will be reflected as a reduction of research and development expense and not as revenue.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	For multiple-element arrangements, each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The deliverables under the Zenyaku agreement have been determined to be a single unit of accounting and as such the non-refundable, up-front fees will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of its estimated performance period under the agreement, which is the product development period.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	We determine the estimated performance period, and it will be periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related product development plan.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	The effect of a change made to an estimated performance period and therefore revenue recognized ratably would occur on a prospective basis in the period that the change was made.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We recognize revenue from milestone payments when: (i) the milestone event is substantive and its achievability has substantive uncertainty at the inception of the agreement, and (ii) we do not have ongoing performance obligations related to the achievement of the milestone earned.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Milestone payments are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payment (a) is commensurate with either our performance subsequent to the inception of the arrangement to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance subsequent to the inception of the arrangement to achieve the milestone, (b) relates solely to past performance, and (c) is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	See Note 6, Collaborative Arrangements , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for analysis of each milestone event deemed to be substantive or non-substantive.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Revenues under the Zenyaku collaborative agreement will be recognized as research costs are incurred or as the research services are performed over the product development period.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The collaborative arrangement is on a best-efforts basis, does not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation and provides for payment to be made when costs are incurred or the services are performed.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Additionally, we receive reimbursement for our personnel cost at a pre-determined full time equivalent (FTE) rate.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Reimbursement related to FTE services is recognized as research services are performed over the related performance periods.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	We are required to perform research and development activities as specified in the collaboration agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The payments received are not refundable and are based on a contractual reimbursement rate per FTE working on the project.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Reimbursement for FTE cost is recorded in research and development revenue as incurred.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Determining whether and when some of these revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in an arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	We account for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our equity incentive plans under the provisions of ASC 718 which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	This model requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized ratably over the requisite service period of the award.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Due to the limited amount of historical data available to us, particularly with respect to stock-price volatility, employee exercise patterns and forfeitures, actual results could differ from our assumptions.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC 505, Equity.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	As a result, the non-cash charge to operations for non-employee options with service or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock, as the underlying equity instruments vest.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	The two factors which most affect these changes are the price of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock-based compensation is recorded and the volatility of the stock price.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Warrants were recorded either as equity instruments or derivative liabilities at their estimated fair value at the date of issuance.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	In the case of warrants recorded as liabilities, subsequent changes in estimated fair value were recorded in other income (expense) in the Company s statement of operations in each subsequent period.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The warrants were measured at estimated fair value using the Black Scholes valuation model, which was based, in part, upon inputs for which there was little or no observable market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	Inherent in this model were assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	We estimated the volatility of our common stock at the date of issuance, and at each subsequent reporting period, based on historical volatility that matched the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the measurement date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	The expected life of the warrants was assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	The dividend rate was based on our historical rate, which was zero.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	The assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the warrants represented our best estimates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P48_S5	However these estimates involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P48_S6	As a result, if factors changed and different assumptions were used, the warrant liability and the changed in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	We make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	We base our accruals related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P51_S4	In accruing for service fees, we estimate the time and materials incurred by these service providers in each period.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P51_S5	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P51_S6	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2014 included a non-cash and one-time charge of $1.0 million in license fee that we recognized in connection with an amendment to the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	We amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of our collaboration with Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by us to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Pursuant to this amendment, we agreed to issue to Amgen that number of shares of our common stock equal to $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 days prior to issuance, or 420,751 shares of common stock at a price of $2.3767 per share, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of the license fee otherwise payable under the Amgen Agreement .
1316175_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	Excluding this non-cash license fee, research and development decreased by $0.9 million from prior year.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	The decrease in research and development expense in 2014 from 2013 is mainly due to decrease in clinical development expense as fewer subjects were treated in our Phase 3 CHABLIS SC1 and Phase 2/3 BRIGHT-SC studies as compared the PEARL-SC and Open Label Extension studies in 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The change in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 was insignificant as compared to the year ended in 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our general and administrative expenditures have remained relatively consistent since we shifted our focus to the development of blisibimod in 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Other expense recorded in both 2014 and 2013 was a result of net loss realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to the refinancing of our debt from Hercules to MidCap and Square 1 Bank in April 2013, which resulted in a significantly reduced interest rate, and repayment of our debts to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in October and December 2014, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, our research and development costs consisted primarily of start-up clinical expenses for the Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 and Phase 2 BRIGHT-SC1 studies and the ongoing costs to support the PEARL-SC OLE study.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Research and development expense decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 mainly due to the completion of the Phase 2 PEARL-SC study in 2012, which contributed to decreases in manufacturing expense, CRO expense and investigator grants by approximately $27.5 million.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Included in general and administrative expenses were $1.7 million and $0.5 million in stock-based compensation in the years ended 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Excluding the non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation, general and administrative expense decreased in 2013 from 2012 by approximately $1.4 million and reflected our ongoing cost reduction efforts that led to decreases in professional, consulting and overhead expenses.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Other expense recorded in both 2013 and 2012 was a result of net loss realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The decrease in interest expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to the refinancing of our debt from Hercules to MidCap and Square 1 Bank in April 2013, which resulted in a significantly reduced interest rate.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the year ended 2012 represented the change in fair value of warrants issued in September 2010 in connection with our private placement of our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The warrants were reclassified from liabilities into equity in July 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	Therefore, there was no mark-to-market adjustment on warrant liability recorded in the year ended 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt, debt financings, public offerings and our IPO raising net proceeds of approximately $335.9 million.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.6 million.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, and our capital expenditure needs.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	On April 5, 2013, we entered into an equity purchase agreement (the 2013 Purchase Agreement ) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC ), pursuant to which we have the right to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $18.5 million in shares of the our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Purchase Agreement will expire in April 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	Upon executing the agreement, LPC made an initial purchase of $2.0 million in shares of common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	Subsequent to the initial purchase, we have sold approximately $2.4 million in shares of common stock to LPC as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	In February 2015, we entered into a new equity purchase agreement (the 2015 Purchase Agreement ) with LPC, pursuant to which we have the right to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $10.0 million in shares of our common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P67_S5	Concurrent with the execution of the 2015 Purchase Agreement, the 2013 Purchase Agreement, which had $14.1 million available for future sale, was cancelled.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	On November 15, 2013, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the Agreement ) with Cowen to create ATM program under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million through Cowen, as agent.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	As of the date of this report, we had sold $21.3 million in shares of common stock, leaving a balance of $3.7 million available for future sale pursuant to the Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	In January 2012, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179043), which was declared effective on January 24, 2012, for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	In July 2012, we utilized $38.0 million of this shelf registration through the issuance 4,743,750 shares of common stock at $8.00 per share.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	In January 2013, we utilized $40.0 million of this shelf registration through the issuance of 7,575,757 shares of common stock at $5.28 per share, followed by another $6.0 million through the issuance of 1,136,362 shares in February 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	In April 2013, we increased the amount of securities that may be issued under the registration statement by $3.2 million through the filing of a post-effective amendment pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P69_S4	In April 2013, we registered $19.0 million for sale under the 2013 LPC Purchase Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P69_S5	This shelf registration statement expired in January 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	In April 2013, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-187780) for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	On November 15, 2013, we registered $25.0 million under the registration statement for the Cowen ATM.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	In January 2015, we registered $8.0 million under the registration statement for the issuance of our commons stock to Zenyaku and Amgen.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	In February 2015, we registered $10.3 million under the registration statement for the 2015 Purchase Agreement with LPC, leaving a balance of $ 56.7 million available for future issuance under this shelf registration statement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Based on the requirements of Form S-3, however, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock and our stock price, which may limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through Purchase Agreement and registration statements described above.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Cash flow from operations during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	During 2014 and 2013, our operating activities used cash of $25.6 million and $31.9 million, respectively, primarily resulting from our decreased net losses and changes in our working capital accounts.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	The decrease in cash used in 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly attributable to lower net loss recognized in 2014 as a result of lower research and development expense due to the Company focusing exclusively on the development of blisibimod and liprotamase.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	In addition, interest expense also decreased significantly in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of our refinancing of our long-term debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in early 2013 and repayment of our debts to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in October and December 2014, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, investing activities provided cash of $10.0 million, which amount represented the release of $10.0 million in restricted cash as a result of repayment of our long-term debt to Square 1 Bank.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, investing activities used cash of $4.7 million, which amount represented the effect of the establishment of $10.0 million in restricted cash for the Square 1 Bank debt, offset by proceeds of $5.3 million from the maturities of short-term investment.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, financing activities used cash of $7.7 million, which represented the net effect of $18.1 million used for the early retirement of our debt to MidCap, offset by $10.4 million in net proceeds received from the sale of stock to LPC and pursuant to the ATM.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, financing activities provided cash of $43.1 million, which represented the net effect of $45.7 million in net proceeds received from a public offering in January 2013, $19.8 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable, offset by net principal payment of $22.4 million.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Cash flow from operations during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	During 2013 and 2012, our operating activities used cash of $31.9 million and $73.6 million, respectively, primarily resulting from our decreased net losses and changes in our working capital accounts.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	The decrease in cash used in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to lower net loss recognized in 2013 as a result of significant decreases in research and development expense as well as general and administrative expense due to the Company focusing exclusively on the development of blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	In addition, interest expense also decreased significantly in 2013 as compared to 2012 as a result of our refinancing of our long-term debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in early 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	During 2013 and 2012, cash used in investing activities was $4.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	The increase in cash used in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to the establishment of $10.0 million in restricted cash in 2013 as a result of our refinancing our long-term debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	The increase in restricted cash was offset by a decrease in purchase of short-term investments by $10.7 million.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	During 2013 and 2012, financing activities provided cash of $43.1 million and $31.3 million, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to higher proceeds received from the sale of our common stock through public offerings and pursuant to an equity purchase agreement with LPC, which was offset by $22.4 million in principal payments to Hercules and Midcap.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	We have lease obligations consisting of an operating lease for our operating facility that expires in September 2017.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following table summarizes our estimated scheduled future minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidates in development, as these payments are not determinable.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Under the Amgen Agreement, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable on a country-by-country basis and licensed on a product-by-licensed-product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicensee in such country, or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Under the Lilly Ageement, we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens, for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	The Company s royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidates into clinical studies and as we:
1316175_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	implement new operational, financial and management information systems.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	the acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	On January 27, 2015, we received $7.0 million from its collaborative partner, Zenyaku, pursuant to the issuance of 2,795,895 shares of our common stock to Zenyaku under the terms of a collaborative arrangement.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Zenyaku will provide up to another $15.0 million to us over the next 18 months through a combination of a forgivable loan and multiple equity purchases of our common stock at a thirty-percent price premium.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Subsequent to December 31, 2014 and through the date of this report, we received net proceeds of $11.5 million pursuant to the sale of equity through an at-the-market program with Cowen and Company, LLC.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	As of the filing of this report, we believe our existing cash, anticipated equity investment and loan proceeds from our partner, Zenyaku, partial reimbursement of global blisibimod development expense from Zenyaku, access to an equity purchase agreement with LPC and proceeds from our ATM program will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to conduct additional or extended clinical studies and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities, if convertible, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to terminate, significantly modify or delay our development programs, or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1316175_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1316175_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
1316175_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
1316175_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, since a majority of our investments are in highly liquid money market funds, we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure.
1316175_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any material derivative financial instruments.
1316175_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents was $2.6 million as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities.
1316175_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary.
1316175_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth beginning in Item 15 of this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive officer and Principal Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to that company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(e), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this report.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process, effected by an entity s board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures which pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management s and or the board of directors authorization; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material errors in our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with our policies and procedures may deteriorate.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We reviewed the results of management s assessment with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P5_S4	B ased on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P5_S5	BDO USA, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, which is included herein.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	In connection with the restatement discussed below, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Based on this reassessment using the COSO criteria, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, because of a material weakness relating to accounting for warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls over the identification and proper accounting treatment of certain terms and conditions in the warrant agreements.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P7_S3	This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our liabilities, non-cash expense relating to the changes in fair value of common stock warrants and accumulated deficit accounts and related financial disclosures and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and each of the quarterly periods from March 31, 2012 through September 30, 2012 (the Affected Periods ).
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P7_S4	Additionally, this deficiency resulted in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that resulted in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	On March 10, 2014, in connection with an internal accounting review related to the accounting for warrants issued in conjunction with a private placement of our common stock in September 2010, management, in consultation with the Audit Committee of our board of directors, concluded that our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012 (the Affected Periods ) should be restated because of a misapplication in the guidance around accounting for warrants that were historically reflected as a component of equity as opposed to liabilities as required under the applicable accounting pronouncements and should no longer be relied upon.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	However, the non-cash adjustments to the consolidated financial statements, in all of the Affected Periods, do not impact the amounts previously reported for our cash and cash equivalents, operating expenses, total operating, investing or financing cash flows, and net operating loss carryforward.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We developed certain remediation steps to address the previously disclosed material weakness discussed above and to improve our internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	We and our Board of Directors take the control and integrity of our financial statements seriously and believe that the remediation steps described below are essential to addressing the material weakness and maintaining a strong internal control environment.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P9_S2	We began implementing these measures in the second quarter of 2014 and continued to develop remediation plans and implemented additional measures throughout the remainder of 2014, including:
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We continued evaluation and enhancement of internal technical accounting capabilities, augmented by the use of third-party advisors and consultants to assist with areas requiring specialized technical accounting expertise and reviewed by management.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We believe the foregoing efforts, which are now fully implemented, have remediated the material weakness previously identified and have enhanced the overall effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls and procedures .
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Upon completion of our testing of the design and operating effectiveness of these newly implemented control procedures, management concluded that it has remediated the previously identified material weakness as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Management remains committed to the rigorous enforcement of an effective control environment.
1316175_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Except for the remediation of the previously identified material weakness discussed above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1316175_15_ITEM15_P4_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P5_S2	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P5_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P6_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1316175_15_ITEM15_P8_S0	We have audited Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P8_S1	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P9_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P9_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	In our opinion, Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria .
1316175_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2014 and our report dated March 16, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:
1316175_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P15_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P16_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P16_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P16_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P16_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	In our opinion, such 2012 consolidated financial statements of the Company present fairly, in all material respects, the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying 2012 financial statements have been restated to correct an error.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

1316175_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs .
1316175_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	Our first Phase 3 product candidate, blisibimod, targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	Our second Phase 3 product candidate, liprotamase, is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company s planned principal operations are acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital and performing research and development activities.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P26_S2	Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets; secure financing; develop a customer base; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and develop strategic alliances.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Since inception in 2004, the Company has funded its operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt and debt financing.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	On January 27, 2015, the Company received $7.0 million from its collaborative partner, Zenyaku, Kogyo Co., Ltd., or Zenyaku, pursuant to the issuance of 2,795,895 shares of its common stock to Zenyaku under the terms of a collaborative arrangement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	Under the terms of the collaborative arrangement, Zenyaku will provide up to another $15.0 million over the next 18 months through a combination of a forgivable loan and multiple equity purchases of the Company s common stock at a thirty-percent price premium.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P27_S3	Subsequent to December 31, 2014 and through the date of this report, the Company received net proceeds of $11.5 million pursuant to the sale of its common stock through an at-the-market program ( ATM ) with Cowen and Company, LLC.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P27_S4	As of the date of this report, the Company anticipates its existing cash, anticipated equity investment and loan proceeds from Zenyaku, partial reimbursement of global blisibimod development expense from Zenyaku, and access to additional capital through an equity purchase agreement are sufficient to fund its near term liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	During 2014, the Company incurred a net loss of $29.6 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $25.6 million.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations over the next several years during its clinical development phase.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	To fully execute its business plan, the Company will need to complete certain research and development activities and clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	Further, the Company s product candidates will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	These activities may span many years and require substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P30_S3	Any delays in completing these activities could adversely impact the Company.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P30_S4	The Company will need substantial additional financing to conduct new trials in the development of its product candidates; such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P30_S5	The Company plans to meet its capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P30_S6	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	On July 15, 2013, the Company effectuated a 1-for-8 reverse split of its common stock.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	All references to shares of common stock outstanding and per share data for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect such reverse split.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company expects to begin recognizing collaboration revenue in 2015 after it completes the initial technology transfer of blisibimod to its collaborative partner, Zenyaku , pursuant to its collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition , subtopic ASC 605-25 Revenue with Multiple Element Arrangements and subtopic ASC 605-28 Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method , which provides accounting guidance for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and guidance on defining the milestone and determining when the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions is appropriate, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	For multiple-element arrangements, each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	If a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement is not deemed to have a stand-alone value, consideration received for such a deliverable is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement or the estimated performance period, and it will be periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related product development plan.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P33_S2	The effect of a change made to an estimated performance period and therefore revenue recognized ratably would occur on a prospective basis in the period that the change was made.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from milestone payments when: (i) the milestone event is substantive and its achievability has substantive uncertainty at the inception of the agreement, and (ii) it does not have ongoing performance obligations related to the achievement of the milestone earned.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	Milestone payments are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payment (a) is commensurate with either the Company s performance subsequent to the inception of the arrangement to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company s performance subsequent to the inception of the arrangement to achieve the milestone, (b) relates solely to past performance, and (c) is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Revenues under the Zenyaku Agreement for collaborative research activities will be recognized as research costs are incurred or as the research services are performed over the product development period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	The collaborative arrangement is on a best-efforts basis, does not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation and provides for payment to be made when costs are incurred or the services are performed.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company s collaboration with Zenyaku provides for various types of payments to Anthera, including development milestones, sales milestone, royalty and reimbursement for a portion of the Company s internal and external cost.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	All payments are nonrefundable to Zenyaku.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	Reimbursement for the Company s external cost will be reflected as a reduction of research and development expenses and not as revenue.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Additionally, for the collaborative research activities, the Company will bill Zenyaku for its personnel cost at a pre-determined full time equivalent (FTE) rate.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	Revenue related to FTE services will be recognized as research services are performed over the related performance periods.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company is required to perform research and development activities as specified in the collaboration agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	The payments received are not refundable and are based on a contractual reimbursement rate per FTE working on the project.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	Reimbursement for FTE cost will be recorded in research and development revenue as incurred.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Determining whether and when some of these revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue the Company will report.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in an arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that the Company reports in a particular period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical accounting policies or estimates related to clinical trial accruals, tax provision, stock-based compensation, allocation of consideration to various elements under multiple-element arrangement and recognition of revenue..
1316175_15_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P40_S3	Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash currencies and money market funds, for which the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P41_S2	Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had restricted cash of $10.0 million to fund a cash security account related to its Square 1 Bank Loan Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	The Company did not have any restricted cash at December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company s cash equivalents consist of certificates of deposit with maturities less than three months and treasury money market funds.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	The Company s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with maturities exceeding three months but less than one year.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P43_S4	The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to five years, using the straight-line method.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the life of the related asset, whichever is shorter.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company s long-lived assets and other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P48_S2	Through December 31, 2014, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Warrants were recorded either as equity instruments or derivative liabilities at their estimated fair value at the date of issuance.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	In the case of warrants recorded as liabilities, subsequent changes in estimated fair value were recorded in other income (expense) in the Company s statement of operations in each subsequent period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S2	The warrants were measured at estimated fair value using the Black Scholes valuation model, which was based, in part, upon inputs for which there was little or no observable market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S3	Inherent in this model were assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S4	The Company estimated the volatility of its common stock at the date of issuance, and at each subsequent reporting period, based on historical volatility that matched the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S5	The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the measurement date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S6	The expected life of the warrants was assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S7	The dividend rate was based on the Company s historical rate, which was at zero.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S8	The assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the warrants represented the Company s best estimates.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S9	However these estimates involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P49_S10	As a result, if factors changed and different assumptions were used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P50_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P50_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P50_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies are generally accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on the Company s behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	The majority of service providers invoice at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P51_S2	The Company periodically confirms the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and makes adjustments if necessary.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P51_S3	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	Clinical study expenses are further separated into two main categories: clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with manufacturing campaign, product formulation and chemical analysis.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company charges research and development costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	Clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P55_S2	All of the Company s clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P55_S3	The Company accrues costs for clinical studies performed by CROs based on patient enrollment activities and adjusts the estimates, if required, based upon the Company s ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P55_S4	The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the CROs, and adjusts the estimates, if required, on a monthly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended by each CRO.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	All material CRO contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and the Company is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain noncancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Comprehensive loss consists of certain changes in equity that is excluded from net loss.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	Specifically, the Company includes unrealized losses on available for sale securities in other comprehensive loss.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	Comprehensive loss for each period presented is set forth in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company operates in only one segment.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company s long-lived tangible assets consisted of mainly machineries purchased by the Company and installed by its contract manufacturing vendor, Fujifilm Diosynth Boservices, in the United Kingdom.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	The machineries are used for all of the Company s blisibimod product manufacturing campaigns.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted- average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	The computation of diluted Earnings Per Share, or EPS, is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	Diluted EPS is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s calculation of net loss per common share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):
1316175_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	As the Company incurred net losses for all of the periods presented, the following outstanding potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the effect of including them would have been antidilutive:
1316175_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, and rights to purchase shares under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our consolidated financial statements over the employees requisite service period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P66_S2	Additionally, the Company is required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	Expected Term The Company s expected term represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	Expected Volatility Expected volatility is estimated using comparable public company volatility for instruments with similar terms.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has never paid dividends and has no plans to pay dividends.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing method is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	The estimated forfeiture rate is determined based on the Company s historical forfeiture rates to date.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company monitors actual forfeitures and periodically updates the estimate.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and recognized as expense over the related service period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	that would (1) provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue recognition; (2) improve comparability of revenue recognition practice across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; and (3) provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P73_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of this standard will have, if any, on our consolidated financial positon, results of operations or cash flows.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance intended to reduce the overall cost and complexity associated with financial reporting for development stage entities, without reducing the availability of relevant information, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 ( ASU 2014-10 ), Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	The amendments made by ASU 2014-10 are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity s financial statements have not yet been issued.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P74_S3	The Company elected to early adopt the new provision of ASU 2014-10 in the interim period ended June 30, 2014 and therefore, has eliminated the presentation of inception-to-date information since June 30, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P74_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to materially affect as consolidated financial statements.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 , Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) ( ASU 2014-15 ).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	ASU 2014-15 requires management of all entities to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued when applicable).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within that fiscal year.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P75_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to materially affect on our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	Certain items in the prior year s Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P77_S3	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
1316175_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and readily accessible by us at the reporting date.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the- counter derivatives.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there are little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The following tables present the Company s fair value hierarchy for all its financial assets (including those in cash and cash equivalents), in thousands, by major security type measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company had no outstanding notes payable as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	At December 31, 2013, the fair value of the principal amount of the Company s outstanding notes payable are classified within the hierarchy as follows (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	The fair value of notes payable is estimated based on current interest rates available to us for debt instruments in similar terms, degrees of risk and remaining maturities.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The carrying value of these obligations, as of each period presented, approximate their respective fair values.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	For disclosure purposes, the fair value of the principal amount of our outstanding debt obligations is considered to be a Level 3 measurement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	There were no transfers between Level 3, Level 2 or Level 1 during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	Property and equipment are comprised of the following (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company recorded the following depreciation expense in the respective periods (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	On December 11, 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Zenyaku ( Zenyaku Agreement ) to develop and commercialize drug candidates relating to blisibimod in Japan and potentially other countries throughout Asia, while the Company retains full development and commercialization rights of blisibimod for all other global territories including North America and the European Union.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, the Company has the right to receive an upfront and forgivable loan of $7.0 million, milestone payments of up to $22.0 million contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, and up to $15.0 million in sales of the Company s common stock at a purchase price equal to 1.3 times the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock for 20 trading days prior to the delivery of the closing notice, (the Premium Purchase Price ).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company exercised this right with respect to $7.0 million in shares of our common stock, and issued 2,795,895 shares at a price per share of $2.50367 to Zenyaku in exchange for $7.0 million in cash, pursuant to the terms of a subscription agreement dated as of January 27, 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	A dditionally, Zenyaku is granted an option to obtain licensing rights for additional countries in Asia for an incremental equity investment of $4 million in Anthera stock.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P88_S4	Zenyaku is responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs and will reimburse Anthera for i) 100% of blisibimod development cost in Japan for IgA nephropathy; ii) 25% of global blisibimod development cost outside of Japan for IgA nephropathy; iii) Anthera s personnel cost at a pre-determined fixed FTE rate and 4) exclusive purchase of blisibimod clinical drug supplies at cost and blisibimod commercial drug products at a premium from the Company.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P88_S5	Outside of Japan, the Company will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization blisibimod.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P88_S6	The collaborative development effort between the parties will be overseen by a joint development committee.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Zenyaku Agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of the last to expire patent covering such product containing blisibimod in such country or ten years following the commercial launch of a product containing blisibimod in such country, unless terminated earlier.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	Zenyaku may terminate the agreement at will or in the event annual sales of generic drug containing blisibimod reach 50% of annual sales of the drug resulting from this collaboration in Japan and other potential Asian countries.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S2	If the agreement is not early terminated, Zenyaku may continue to obtain clinical/commercial drug supplies from Anthera after such expiration for three (3) years from providing a written notice to discontinue such supplies.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S3	Either party may terminate the agreement if a party materially breaches the agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S4	In addition, Anthera may terminate the agreement if Zenyaku challenges any Anthera patent.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S5	Upon expiration (but not earlier termination), Zenyaku may retain the licensed patent on a fully-paid and royalty free (subject to the Amgen royalty and any third party payments), irrevocable and perpetual basis.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S6	Upon termination due to material breach by Anthera, Zenyaku is entitled to retain all license rights; however, is still obligated to pay the milestone payments to Anthera, Amgen royalty any third party payments.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P89_S7	Upon termination due to material breach or at will by Zenyaku, all license rights granted to Zenyaku automatically terminate.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company s deliverables under the Zenyaku Agreement include the delivery of rights to and license for blisibimod in Japan and performance of research and development activities under a joint development plan.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	The delivered license does not have standalone value at the inception of the arrangement due to the Company s proprietary expertise with respect to the licensed compound and related ongoing developmental participation under the collaboration agreement, which is required for Zenyaku to fully realize the value from the delivered license.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	Therefore, the fees the license will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated performance period under the agreement, which is the product development period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P90_S3	Although the Zenyaku Agreement does not provide a contractually stated price for the rights to blisibimod, the Company determined the Premium Purchase Price to be paid by Zenyaku for its equity investment in Anthera represents consideration for the rights to blisibimod and will record deferred revenue as shares are issued to Zenyaku at the Premium Purchase Price .
1316175_15_ITEM15_P90_S4	The Company will periodically review and, if necessary, revise the estimated periods of performance of its collaboration with Zenyaku.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	Fees for the performance of research and development activities and services are not refundable.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	Therefore, the Company will recognize all FTE reimbursement in research and development revenue as such services are rendered.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	Reimbursement for certain development costs will be recorded as a reduction to research and development expense in the period in which such reimbursement becomes due in accordance with ASC 808 Collaborative Arrangements , subtopic ASC 808-10-45.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	Of the remaining potential future milestones, $7.0 million are related to regulatory milestones and $15.0 million are related to commercialization milestones that may be received under the Zenyaku Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	Regulatory milestones include the filing and acceptance of regulatory applications for marketing approval in major markets.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	Commercialization milestones include the achievement of first commercial sales in a particular market or annual product sales in excess of a pre-specified threshold.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	At the inception of the collaboration agreement the Company assessed regulatory milestones to be substantive where there was substantive scientific and regulatory uncertainty of achievement, the amounts of payments assigned were considered to be commensurate with the enhancement, that occurred subsequent to inception of the Zenyaku Agreement, of the value of the delivered rights and license of blisibimod and the Company s performance is necessary to the achievement of the milestone.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S2	Accordingly, the Company will recognize payments related to the achievement of such milestones, if any, when such milestone is achieved.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S3	Regulatory milestones that do not meet these conditions are considered non-substantive and payments related to the achievement of such milestones, if any, will be recorded as deferred revenue and amortized ratably over the estimated period of performance.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S4	Final determination of whether a regulatory milestone is substantive will depend upon the Company s role in achieving the milestone.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S5	The specific role and responsibilities related to the regulatory and development activities for certain of these milestones have yet to be determined and may change during the development period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S6	Under the Zenyaku Agreement, Zenyaku will initially be responsible for commercialization activities and the Company initially may not be involved in the achievement of these commercialization milestones.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S7	These commercialization milestones would typically be achieved after the completion of the Company s regulatory and development activities.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P94_S8	If there are no future development obligations, the Company expects to account for the commercialization milestones in the same manner as royalties, with revenue recognized upon achievement of the milestone.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	Pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement, the Company is entitled to enter into a loan agreement with Zenyaku for an aggregate principal amount of $7.0 million, of which $5.0 million, together with interest thereon, is forgivable upon certain achievement of the primary endpoint identified in the first Phase 3 Study for blisibimod to treat IgA nephropathy and the remaining $2.0 million, together with interest thereon, is forgivable upon the submission of the first Biologics License Application for blisibimod in the licensed territory.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	In exchange, Anthera will issue a Secured Promissory Note to Zenyaku (the Promissory Note ), to be secured by certain information and materials necessary for the manufacture of blisibimod, with a maturity date of December 11, 2021 and an accrued interest of 1% per annum.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P95_S2	The loan agreement is planned for execution in the first half of 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P95_S3	Proceeds from the Promissory Note and granting the license rights will be allocated in part to the Promissory Note based on its aggregate fair value at the dates of receipt.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P95_S4	This fair value will be determined by discounting cash flows using a discount rate of market rate of borrowings that could be obtained by companies with credit risk similar to Anthera.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P95_S5	The remainder of the proceeds will be recognized as debt issuance discount and will be allocated to the value of the license fee granted to Zenyaku and recognized over the product development period while the debt discount will be amortized over the term of the Promissory Note using effective interest rate method.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company leases its main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	The lease is for approximately 14,000 square feet.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P96_S2	The Company recognizes rental expense on the facility on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P96_S3	Differences between the straight-line net expense on rent payments is classified as deferred rent liability and included in the accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.

1316175_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	In December 2007, the Company and Amgen entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement (the Amgen Agreement ) to develop and commercialize blisibimod in any indication, including for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company paid a nonrefundable, upfront license fee of $6.0 million.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	As there was no future alternative use for the technology, the Company expensed the license fee in research and development expenses during 2007.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P99_S3	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company is obligated to make additional milestone payments to Amgen of up to $33.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P99_S4	The Company is also obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the high single digits to the low double digits, which are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P99_S5	The Company s royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	In connection with the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement, the Company amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of the collaboration between Anthera and Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by Anthera to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	Under this amendment, Anthera also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of its common stock equal $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P100_S2	The Company issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015 , pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement .
1316175_15_ITEM15_P100_S3	The Company accrued $1.0 million of license fees as research and development expense with a corresponding current liability in the year ended December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	On July 11, 2014, the Company and Eli Lilly and Company ( Eli Lilly ) entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement (the Lilly Agreement ), to develop and commercialize liprotamase , a Phase 3 novel investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ), for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency, or EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, the Company was not required to make any up-front payment but is obligated to make milestone payments of up to up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P101_S2	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, the Company is obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens, that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P101_S3	The Company s royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.

1316175_15_ITEM15_P140_S1	The Company has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.

1316175_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 2014, 2013, and 2012 is as follows:
1316175_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	Tax benefits of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carryforwards are recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is more likely than not.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P144_S1	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P144_S2	Because of the Company s history of operating losses, management believes that the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits are currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P144_S3	The net valuation allowance increased by $11.7 million in 2014, increased by $11.9 million in 2013, and decreased by $38.3 million in 2012.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	The amount of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with excess tax deductions from stock-based compensation arrangements that would be allocated to contributed capital if the future tax benefits are subsequently recognized is $1.4 million.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	Net operating losses and tax return credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2014, are as follows (in thousands):

1316175_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide for annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss and research and experimentation credit carryforwards if the Company were to undergo an ownership change, as defined in Section 382.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	In general, an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by 5-percent shareholders, as defined in Section 382, increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such 5-percent shareholders at any time over the preceding three years.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	The Company incurred an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 and 383 during 2012 and as such, the Company s net operating loss carryforwards are limited.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P149_S3	As a result of the Section 382 limitation, $144.9 million of the Company s net operating losses and $11.5 million of R D credits have been written off.

1316175_15_ITEM15_P149_S6	The federal and state R D credits reported are not subject to limitation.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	Subsequent to 2012 and through 2014, the Company has sold an aggregate of 4,260,419 shares of its common stock under an ATM with Cowen and an equity purchase agreement with LPC, such an ownership change may have occurred again.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P150_S1	Accordingly, the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards which existed at that time could be limited.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P150_S2	The Company has not completed a Section 382 analysis to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since the Company became a loss corporation under the Code.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P150_S3	The Company has and will continue to evaluate alternative analyses permitted under Section 382 and IRS notices to determine whether or not any ownership changes have occurred and may occur (and if so, when they occurred) that would result in limitations on its net operating losses ( NOLs ) or certain other tax attributes.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1.0 million, all of which would not currently affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company s deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P151_S1	The Company did not anticipate any significant change to the unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P151_S2	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
1316175_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the $1.3 million reduction in the unrecognized tax benefit related to prior years positions is due to the Section 382 limitation discussed above.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company would classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, if applicable.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P153_S1	There was no interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through December 31, 2014.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P153_S2	The tax years 2004 through 2014 remain open to examination by one or more major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized net tax benefits will significantly change prior to the end of 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P155_S0	Subsequent to the issuance of the Company s 2012 consolidated financial statements, the Company concluded that its previously issued 2012, 2011 and 2010 consolidated financial statements should be restated because of a misapplication in the guidance around accounting for the warrants issued in September 2010.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	On September 24, 2010, in connection with a private placement of the Company s Common Stock, the Company issued warrants to the investors to purchase an aggregate of 525,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $26.40 per share.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P156_S1	These warrants have an exercise period of five years and will expire on September 24, 2015.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P156_S2	The warrants provided the holders with anti-dilution price protection in the event the Company issues securities at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P156_S3	Historically, the warrants were reflected as a component of equity as opposed to liabilities on the balance sheets and the statements of operations did not include the subsequent non-cash changes in estimated fair value of the warrants in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	Under the guidance of ASC 815, warrant instruments that provide for anti-dilution price protection, should be initially classified as derivative liabilities at their estimated fair values.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P157_S1	In periods subsequent to issuance, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments should be recorded as non-cash income or expense in the statement of operations until the applicable warrants are exercised or the exercise price of the warrants becomes fixed.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P157_S2	Management, in consultation with the Company s Audit Committee, determined that the financial statements should be restated to reflect the warrants as liabilities, with subsequent changes in their estimated fair value recorded as non-cash income or expense until the exercise price of the warrants became fixed on July 24, 2012 upon the closing of an equity offering by the Company pursuant to which the Company sold common stock at $8.00 per share, which triggered an adjustment to the exercise price of the warrants to a floor price of $23.20 per share as specified in the warrants.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	The effects of the restatement on the following financial statement line items as of and for the periods indicated are summarized in the following tables (in thousands except share and per share amounts, net loss per basic and diluted share has been adjusted for the Company s 1-for-8 reverse split of its outstanding common stock effectuated on July 15, 2013) :
1316175_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	In addition to the effects on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012, discussed above, the restatement affected Additional Paid In Capital, Accumulated Deficit and Total Stockholders Equity (Deficit).
1316175_15_ITEM15_P159_S1	Total Stockholders Equity (Deficit) decreased from $19,084 (as previously reported) to $2,746 (as restated) as of December 31, 2011.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P159_S2	The restatement affected Additional Paid In Capital and Accumulated Deficit as of December 31, 2011 and 2012 as follows:
1316175_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	(1) Adjusted for the Company s 1-for-8 reverse stock split effectuated on July 15, 2013.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	The restatement effect on the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 was the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment on the warrant liability of $14,070 and an offsetting effect on net loss, resulting in no net impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P161_S1	Therefore, the consolidated statement of cash flows is not included as there were no changes to the Company s operating, investing and financing net cash flows as previously reported.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	Quarterly results were as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
1316175_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	As previously reported, in January 2015, the Company sold $8.0 million in common shares under the registration statement filed with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-187780), consisting of 2,795,895 shares and 420,751 shares of the Company s common stock to Zenyaku and Amgen, respectively.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P163_S1	The Company received net cash proceeds of $7.0 million from Zenyaku for the shares sold to Zenyaku.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P163_S2	The consideration paid by Amgen for its shares of the Company s common stock was in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen by the Company under an amendment to the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	Subsequent to December 31, 2014 and through the date of this report, the Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $11.5 million pursuant to the sale of equity through its ATM program.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	In March 2015, the Company terminated the 2013 Purchase Agreement with LPC, which had a remaining balance of $14.1 million and executed the 2015 Purchase Agreement with more favorable terms, pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not obligation, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $10.0 million in shares of common stock over a period of two years.
1316175_15_ITEM15_P165_S1	As a result of the execution of the 2015 Purchase agreement, $56.7 million remains available for future issuance under the Company s shelf registration statement.

1316175_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	We currently have two Phase 3 product candidates, liprotamase also known as Sollpura TM and blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	We licensed liprotamase from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), or lupus, Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Liprotamase is a novel non-porcine PERT that contains three biotechnology-derived digestive enzymes: a lipase, a protease and an amylase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Through enzyme cross-linking, the lipase enzyme in liprotamase is more stable than the porcine derived lipase in the low pH environment of the stomach and therefore liprotamase does not have an enteric polymer coating.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Furthermore, since the three enzymes in liprotamase are biotechnology-derived, liprotamase does not contain porcine proteins or purines that may be associated with a risk of viral transmission or allergic reaction to proteins of porcine origin.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	The individual enzyme components of liprotamase are formulated at a fixed ratio of lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	The liprotamase enzyme dose ratio was selected from preclinical efficacy studies conducted using a canine model of pancreatic insufficiency which demonstrated that the lipase enzyme in liprotamase was efficacious when administered at 500 units/kg per meal, and the protease doses 1000 units/kg per meal (Borowitz et al . 2006).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	This finding is further supported by the similar efficacy observed between liprotamase and Creon in pigs with surgically-induced pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is currently the mainstay of treatment for nutrient malabsorption in patients with digestive enzyme deficiencies known as EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	EPI occurs when diseases such as cystic fibrosis, or CF, and chronic pancreatitis impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Orally delivered porcine PERTs have been available for many years for the treatment of EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Unmet medical needs for the treatment of EPI remain.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	For example, as the porcine-derived proteins contained in the PERTs pass through the low pH environment of the stomach, enzyme activity rapidly diminishes and, as a consequence, large doses of porcine enzymes are often required.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Since porcine lipase can become irreversibly deactivated in an acid environment, most products are enterically-coated.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Patient-to-patient differences in the acidity of the intestine makes dissolution of enterically-coated products variable, and gives rise to alterations in the rate and extent to which enzymes are released from these products.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	Poor stability and variability in terms of potency and pharmaceutical properties have also been identified as important factors contributing to a poor response of some patients to PERTs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Liprotamase is a novel PERT intended for the treatment of EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The exocrine pancreas is responsible for synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, including lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	EPI occurs when diseases such as CF and chronic pancreatitis impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	A reduction in, or absence of the normally secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes, causes lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to enter the distal gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract in unabsorbable forms, leading to GI pain and distention, maldigestion, and steatorrhea.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Without appropriate therapy, patients with EPI may experience malnutrition, poor growth or weight loss, reduced quality of life, and, in severe cases, increased morbidity and early death.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe liprotamase is potentially the first soluble, stable and non-porcine derived enzyme product to offer a novel solution to patients who are unable to maintain appropriate nutritional health.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Liprotamase s chemical characteristics, unlike currently available PERTs, make it ideal for powder formulation as either a capsule, or sachet of powder for oral solution which can be conveniently administered in solution in a small volume of water.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	We initiated the SOLUTION study in the third quarter of 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	SOLUTION is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of liprotamase in patients with cystic fibrosis-related exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	This pivotal study is intended to evaluate the non-inferiority of liprotamase compared with another commercially available PERT in a population enriched for PERT responders and will enroll up to 150 patients in the United States and Europe.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	Liprotamase will be supplied in capsule form for the SOLUTION study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	A second, smaller Phase 3 study, SIMPLICITY, in younger pediatric subjects is planned for initiation in first half of 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	The SIMPLICITY study will utilize sachets containing liprotamase powder for oral solution for ease of administration and will enroll approximately 60 patients.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P15_S6	We believe the SOLUTION and SIMPLICITY studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed PERTs, including:
1316175_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	a capsule formulation using known, safe, excipients that provides lower pill burden and good delivery performance.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	a sachet formulation containing liprotamase power for oral solution which can be easily dissolved into water, and finally provides patients, especially young pediatric patients, with an easy-to-swallow dosing option.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	BAFF, or B-cell Activating Factor, (also known as B lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS), is a member of a tumor necrosis family of natural human proteins and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell lineages as well as plasma cells all of which are critical to the human immune response.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and other dangerous antigens.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	Abnormally high elevations of BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including lupus and IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Based on data from our Phase 2b clinical study, we have advanced the clinical development of our BAFF inhibitor, blisibimod, to exploit its potential clinical utility in a number of autoimmune diseases.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	In 2012, we completed the PEARL-SC Phase 2b clinical study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Lupus patients suffer from a chronic autoimmune disease, where an inappropriate or abnormal immune response often leads to severe skin rash, fatigue, joint pain, ulceration, major kidney complications, including proteinuria, and cardiovascular disease.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Inhibition of BAFF is believed to reduce survival of B-cells and plasma cells and autoantibodies, leading to a reduction in severity of disease and resolution of lupus symptoms.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	The development program for blisibimod is focused on evaluating the efficacy and safety of blisibimod in patients with lupus, and IgA nephropathy for which we believe current treatments are either inadequate or non-existent.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our current plan includes continuing the ongoing CHABLIS-SC1 registration clinical study in patients with active lupus and the BRIGHT-SC phase 2 clinical study in patients with IgA nephropathy, initiating CHABLIS-SC 7.5, and evaluating the potential of blisibimod in hematological diseases through clinical and nonclinical investigations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch-scale quantities.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	The blisibimod product is designed for at-home, self-administration and is presented as a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	In the third quarter of 2012 at an End of Phase 2 meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we presented the results of the PEARL-SC study and our plans for Phase 3 registration studies in patients with active lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	As a result of this meeting we initiated patient enrollment in the initial Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 study in March 2013.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	CHABLIS-SC1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with seropositive, clinically-active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard-of-care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	The study enrolled 442 SLE patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo in addition to their standard-of-care medication for 52 weeks.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	Topline data is expected after the last enrolled patient completes 52 weeks of treatment around the third quarter of 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	The primary endpoint of the CHABLIS-SC1 will be clinical improvement in the SLE Responder Index-6 (SRI-6) response at 52 weeks.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	Key secondary outcomes from the study, including SRI-8, reduction in the number of lupus flares and steroid use, are intended to provide more insight into blisibimod s efficacy, and further differentiate blisibimod from currently available therapies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	The demographics and disease characteristics of the patients enrolled in the CHABLIS-SC1 study are consistent with our goal to enroll patients with higher levels of lupus activity and positive biomarkers despite the stable use of corticosteroids.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	These characteristics were associated with improved outcomes in both our previous Phase 2 clinical study as well as in large Phase 3 studies conducted with other BAFF-inhibitors, belimumab (Benlysta) and tabalumab.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe the CHABLIS development program for blisibimod may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed BAFF antagonist and other novel B-cell directed therapies, including:
1316175_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	fully human IgG1 Fc domain confers acceptable pharmacokinetic properties to support once-weekly dosing.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meets regularly over the course of the study to assess patient safety.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	During these regular meetings, the DSMB reviews un-blinded safety data which include adverse events, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or SUSARs, deaths, laboratory data, and withdrawal data and compares trends between treatments.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	After the most recent scheduled meeting in November 2015, the DSMB recommended continuing the CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	In February 2015, an interim analysis of CHABLIS-SC1 was conducted by an independent un-blinded statistician, who evaluated at a pre-specified time point, the proportion of responders to the systemic lupus erythematous SRI-6 responder index, and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	This futility analysis was not intended to provide any rules for stopping for overwhelming efficacy, for a change in study sample size, or for an alteration of the study design.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	Rather, the analysis suggests that the observed data conforms with the assumptions upon which the trial was designed.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	The systemic lupus erythematosus response index is a recognized endpoint by the FDA for previously approved therapeutics.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Prior to the interim analysis and on the advice of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluated the published clinical data from other recent lupus studies with BAFF inhibitors, we modified the primary endpoint of CHABLIS-SC1 from a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-8 responder index to a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-6 responder index (previously a secondary endpoint of the study) as data, including emerging observations with tabalumab (Isenberg et al ., Annual Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, November 2014), suggest that SRI-6 responder rates are consistent and stable across multiple trials.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Response rates to the SRI-8 responder index will remain a key secondary endpoint of the study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	In addition to serving as a registration study for a potential lupus indication, observations in this study are intended to be included in marketing applications for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy and other indications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	We submitted a study protocol for our second lupus study, CHABLIS 7.5 (formerly named CHABLIS-SC2), to the FDA in the third quarter of 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	The CHABLIS 7.5 study s name emphasizes the intent to reduce background corticosteroid medication to 7.5mg prednisone in order to mitigate the risks associated with long-term steroid medication.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	This study will evaluate the effect of blisibimod on top of standard-of-care medication in patients with severe, seropositive SLE that is inadequately controlled with corticosteroids.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	Patient eligibility for this study is informed by responder traits identified in the Phase 2 trial with blisibimod as well as the large Phase 3 programs with other BAFF inhibitors, belimumab and tabalumab.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	We plan to initiate the CHABLIS 7.5 study in the first half of 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P36_S5	These two pivotal studies are anticipated to form the basis of submission for blisibimod as a treatment for active SLE that is not controlled by standard-of-care medication, including corticosteroids.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We partnered our development of IgA nephropathy with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. ( Zenyaku ) through a collaborative and license agreement executed in December 2014, which agreement was terminated effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	According to the National Organization of Rare Disease, IgA nephropathy, an orphan indication, is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually in the United States.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	In Asia, a higher reported prevalence is attributed to the routine urinalyses that are often performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for any patients with asymptomatic hematuria.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	IgA nephropathy may occur when plasma B-cells express excessive amounts of abnormal IgA and subsequent immune complexes containing this immunogenic protein are deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	These IgA deposits build up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	According to a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (Wyatt Julian, 2013), primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Similar to patients with other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, in IgA nephropathy, elevated levels of BAFF are associated with histological severity of disease in kidney tissue.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	In patients with IgA nephropathy, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy individuals.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	In IgA nephropathy, increased plasma B-cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	Significant reductions in plasma B-cells were observed in previous clinical studies of patients with lupus with another BAFF inhibitor antibody, belimumab.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	In our PEARL-SC Phase 2b study, significant reductions in total B-cells as well as significant improvements in proteinuria and increases in complement C3 were observed with blisibimod in lupus patients.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce proliferative B-cells and plasma B-cells, reduce serum levels of IgA and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	The BRIGHT-SC study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Enrollment criteria are biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Patients must be receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The BRIGHT-SC study was initiated in the second quarter of 2013.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The BRIGHT-SC clinical study has enrolled patients in Southeast Asia, the European Union ( EU ) and Eastern Europe.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	In March 2015, an interim futility analysis of BRIGHT-SC study was conducted by an independent unblinded statistician, who evaluated several important biomarkers of renal disease in patients who had completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	We plan to conduct an analysis of the clinical data in the first half of 2016 when more than 40 patients have completed 6 months of treatment, followed by a longer-term treatment data in the second half of 2016 when a majority of the patients have completed one year of treatment.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	According to IMS Health, EPI is a disease that affects an estimated 250,000 patients in the United States.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	The most common causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, the former a longstanding inflammation of the pancreas altering the organ's normal structure and function that can result in malnutrition, heredity, or (in the western world especially), behavior (alcohol use and smoking), and the latter a recessive hereditary disease most common in Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews where the molecular culprit is an altered, CFTR-encoded chloride channel.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	In children, another common cause is Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the SBDS gene.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Lupus is an autoimmune disorder that involves inflammation that causes swelling, pain and tissue damage throughout the body.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Lupus can affect any part of the body, but especially the skin, heart, brain, lungs, joints and kidneys.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	The course of the disease is unpredictable, with periods of disease worsening, called flares.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Although lupus may affect people of either sex, women are 10 times more likely to suffer from the disease than men, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	According to the Alliance for Lupus Research, it is estimated that up to 1.5 million people have lupus in the United States.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Lupus Europe estimates that one in 750 women suffers from lupus in Europe and that lupus is a worldwide disease more common in some races than others.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	It is estimated that approximately 10% of people with lupus are treated in the United States.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Based on the results from our PEARL-SC study, we believe patients in the moderate-to-severe lupus, approximately 30,000 to 40,000 people, are likely to benefit most from treatment with blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	This is the population we are enrolling in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Patients with active lupus may have a broad range of symptoms related to an abnormally active immune response in one or more organs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	In the brain, lupus may cause seizures and other neurologic abnormalities.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	In the heart, lupus may cause heart failure or sudden death.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	Lung inflammation in the lung may cause shortness of breath, pleurisy and chest pain.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	Lupus may also cause swollen joints, arthritis, muscle aches, proteinuria, severe rash, oral ulcers and alopecia.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	In addition, patients with lupus nephritis may require kidney dialysis or eventual transplantation.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Although the cause of lupus is still not completely understood, B-cell activation and autoantibody production are known to be central to the process.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Evidence has emerged that over-expression of BAFF correlates with disease severity in patients (Petri M .

1316175_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	In preclinical studies, transgenic mice created to over-express BAFF begin to exhibit symptoms similar to lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	In addition, treatment of lupus-prone mice with blisibimod ameliorates the disease (Hsu H, Khare S.D., Lee F, Miner K, Hu YL, Stolina M., Hawkins N., Chen Q., Ho S.Y., Min H., Xiong F., Boone T., Zack D.J., A Novel Modality of BAFF-Specific Inhibitor AMG623 Peptibody Reduces B-cell Number and Improves Outcomes in Murine Models of Autoimmune Disease . 2012, Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology, 30(2): 197-201).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a human antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity, which is a portion of the immune system that provides protection to an organism s various mucous membranes from invasion by infections.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	IgA nephropathy (also known as IgA nephritis or Berger's disease) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidney) throughout the world and a principal cause of end-stage renal disease.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	The prevalence of IgA nephropathy varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan and China), Australia, Finland and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulonephritis).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein, especially aberrant and immunogenic forms of IgA, is deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	These immunogenic IgA immune complexes deposit inside the small blood vessels of the kidney and, as a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	The classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) of signs and symptoms in patients with IgA nephropathy is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection or (less commonly) gastrointestinal or urinary infection.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	In the United States, IgA nephropathy is considered an orphan disease as it is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for patients with asymptomatic hematuria and the reported prevalence of the disease is much higher.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	For example, in Japan, IgA nephropathy is estimated to affect over 350,000 people annually.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	In December 2011, we completed the manufacturing site transfer from Amgen to our contract manufacturing organization ( CMO ), Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices ( Fujifilm ).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	We also scaled up manufacturing from 300 liters up to 3,000 liters.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	Three batches of blisibimod produced under U.S. and EU good manufacturing procedures ( GMPs ), at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	We have successfully manufactured blisibimod at launch scale volumes to support the CHABLIS-SC1, CHABLIS-7.5 and BRIGHT-SC studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	We are currently evaluating an auto injector strategy for use with the subcutaneous product presentation of blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Technology transfer to commercial scale active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API and drug product manufacturing CMOs was initiated in 2015 and is ongoing.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	The large scale fermentation and the associated down-stream processing for all three enzyme APIs are anticipated to be complete through process validation in 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	In parallel, commercial scale capsule and sachet manufacturing are also being established at respective product CMOs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	In 2013, our licensor, Eli Lilly, gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a Phase 3 trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of liprotamase to respond to the FDA s 2011 complete response letter.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Phase 3 study (SOLUTION) is a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study intended to evaluate the non-inferiority of liprotamase compared with another commercially available PERT.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	The SOUTION design also addresses the 2005 EMA protocol assistance comments, which were consistent with the FDA s request for an active comparator trial.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Phase 3 program for blisibimod was presented to the European Medicines Agency (EMA, Scientific Advice) in the second quarter of 2012, to the FDA in the third quarter of 2012 (End-of-Phase 2 meeting) and to the FDA in a follow-up advice procedure in the third quarter of 2013 (Type C request to which the FDA provided written responses in lieu of a meeting).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	The Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC program incorporates feedback and advice obtained from both regulatory agencies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	The Phase 3 studies (CHABLIS-SC1 and CHABLIS7.5) are planned to be multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies intended to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with clinically active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard of care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P70_S3	The design of the second Phase 3 study, CHABLIS-7.5, will be based on input advice from clinical experts as well as learnings from recently reported data from clinical trials in SLE.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P70_S4	The CHABLIS-SC1 study has completed enrollment of 442 patients, and the CHABLIS 7.5 protocol was submitted to the FDA in the second half of 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	In September 2013, we met with the FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as an endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	In this meeting we gained the PMDA s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan and have amended the BRIGHT-SC study to include the specific data requirements of the PMDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P71_S4	We reached an agreement with the EMA on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable as well as the requirement for a single study to support a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application ( CMAA ) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study, would be available post approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P71_S5	The EMA also recommended the protocol to provide information on the required duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P71_S6	Data generated from the analysis of the BRIGHT-SC study in the first half of 2016, will be used to guide the final study design elements for the Phase 3 registration study protocol.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	We continue to dose patients in our BRIGHT-SC clinical study for the treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ), an orphan disease.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Following results from previous studies in SLE, namely the PEARL-SC phase 2 clinical study, where patients, with baseline urinary protein excretion ( UPE ) of greater than one gram per 24 hours, demonstrated statistically significant reductions in urinary protein after 24 weeks, we initiated the BRIGHT-SC clinical study to evaluate the effects of blisibimod treatment in patients with IgAN.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	Following our receipt of a termination notice from Zenyaku and the subsequent expiration of the 120-day termination period on January 7, 2016, we elected to stop further enrollment in the BRIGHT-SC clinical study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	We have enrolled 57 patients, 45 of which remained in the study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S3	We plan to conduct a proof-of-concept efficacy analysis when substantially all patients have received a minimum of six months of therapy in Q2 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S4	This analysis will examine the effects of blisibimod versus placebo in the proportion of qualifying patients who achieve a complete response ( CR ) and a partial response ( PR ) at six months.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S5	CR is defined as the proportion of patients with baseline UPE of greater than two grams per 24 hours, achieving UPE of less than one gram per 24 hours or a 50% reduction in UPE from baseline, and the proportion of patients with baseline UPE between one and two grams per 24 hours, achieving UPE of less than one gram per 24 hours and a 50% reduction from baseline.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S6	PR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving urinary protein excretion ( UPE ) of less than or equal to one gram per 24 hours.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S7	Based on our previous discussions with regulatory authorities, we believe an evaluation of the change in proteinuria could serve as a surrogate endpoint to support an accelerated or conditional approval in various key commercial geographies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P73_S8	Following the completion of the BRIGHT-SC study we intend to explore a Special Protocol Assessment from the US FDA to ensure final concurrence on the willingness to consider proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint, the timing for completion of enrollment of the post marketing confirmatory study and blisibimod s eligibility to receive orphan designation.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Liprotamase was studied from 2002 to 2009 in seven clinical trials, in which a total of 492 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	Three Phase 1 trials were conducted, 1 in healthy volunteers and 2 in subjects with EPI due to CF.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	Two short-term trials, the Phase 2 Study TC-2A, and the Phase 3 Study 726 evaluated the efficacy of liprotamase in subjects 7 years of age with EPI due to CF.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	Two long-term Phase 3 safety and tolerability trials were also conducted: Study 767 in subjects with EPI due to CF and Study 810 in subjects with EPI due to CP/pancreatectomy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Completed clinical trials demonstrated that dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) absorption are significantly increased in patients with cystic fibrosis and EPI who received liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	In 2013, Eli Lilly gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a pivotal trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	The dose-ranging Phase 1 study TC-1B evaluated five dose levels across a 50-fold range, from 100-to-5000 units (U) per kg per meal in CF-EPI subjects.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	In this study, greater improvements in nutrients absorption, as measured using the percent change from baseline in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA), were observed at doses of 500 U per kg per meal and higher.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	Study TC-2A, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-finding trial, was conducted in 125 pediatric and adult subjects with CF-related EPI who were treated with liprotamase in one of three dosing regimens containing 6,500 U, 32,500 U, and 130,000 U lipase administered per meal or snack.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	Observed mean CFAs at the end of study were 56.2%, 67.0%, and 69.7% in the 6,500, 32,500, and 130,000 U dose groups, respectively (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0032) with significant improvements in mean changes from baseline (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0005).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	Pairwise comparison of the CFA values showed that statistically greater improvements were observed at the higher doses of liprotamase compared with the lowest dose of 6,500 U (Figure 1).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	Similar improvements in the CNA, were observed with liprotamase at the two highest dose levels.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	Study 726, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, parallel design, multinational clinical, evaluated the effects of a single capsule of liprotamase (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) or placebo administered with every meal or snack in subjects with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	Amongst the 138 subjects enrolled in this study, treatment with liprotamase resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in the CFA of 21.2% with liprotamase compared with 6.0% with placebo (p = 0.0011) (Figure 2).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	The median body weight of subjects in this trial was 50 kg, for which the corresponding liprotamase dose was 650 U lipase/kg/meal or snack.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Two long-term studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and effects on nutritional status of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	Study 810 evaluated adult subjects with EPI due to CP or after pancreatectomy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Amongst the 214 subjects who were treated, an average dose of 5.5 capsules (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) of liprotamase per day maintained nutritional status as assessed by serial measurement of height and weight, including age-appropriate growth and weight gain in children.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	Mean BMI z-scores for subjects in Study 767 were maintained over time on study (mean BMI z-score at baseline, Months 3, 6, and 12 were -0.503,-0.637, -0.688, and -0.655, respectively).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	To date, four randomized, clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two Phase 1 dose-ranging studies in which a total of 104 patients were enrolled by our licensor, Amgen, a Phase 2b double-blind placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical outcomes study (PEARL-SC) in which 547 subjects were enrolled, and a Phase 2 Open-Label Extension study (OLE) which evaluated the long-term safety of blisibimod in subjects previously enrolled in the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study, both conducted by us.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	As expected for a BAFF inhibitor, statistically significant reductions in total B-cells were observed in patients treated with blisibimod compared with placebo in all three of the placebo-controlled studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	Based on positive safety and pharmacodynamics results among 118 lupus patients in Amgen s Phase 1a and 1b clinical studies, we conducted the PEARL-SC study, a Phase 2b randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various subcutaneous doses of blisibimod in patients with seropositive lupus and active disease defined as SELENA-SLEDAI 6 at enrollment, which ran from mid-2010 to April 2012.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	The study enrolled 547 patients in 11 countries at 72 clinical sites.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	All patients completed the PEARL-SC study when the final enrolled patient completed six months of therapy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	In June and July of 2012 we announced results from the Phase 2b PEARL-SC study, which we believe support the initiation of a differentiated Phase 3 registration plan utilizing a 200mg weekly dose of blisibimod in patients with active lupus, despite the concomitant use of corticosteroids.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	The primary endpoint of the PEARL-SC study was a clinical improvement at the lupus responder index, or SRI-5, at week 24 for the pooled blisibimod dose groups versus placebo groups.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	SRI-5 is defined as a five-point improvement in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new BILAG 1A or 2B scores, and no new increase in Physician s Global Assessment of more than 0.3 points.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S2	The primary endpoint of this study was not met due to the lack of efficacy in the two lowest dose groups.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S3	However, the primary endpoint SRI-5 responder rates were numerically higher in subjects receiving blisibimod 200mg weekly (QW) compared with pooled placebo, from Week 16 ( SRI 5 for blisibimod-placebo=8%, p= 0.14), through Week 24 ( SRI 5=8.2%, p=0.15), reaching statistical significance at Week 20 ( SRI 5=13.4%, p = 0.02).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S4	Treatment benefit was greater still when compared with the regimen-matched (QW) placebo.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S5	In pre-specified secondary analyses, benefit was observed at Week 24 with the 200mg QW group compared with matched placebo using modified SRI analyses in which responders attained SELENA-SLEDAI improvements of 7 or 8 ( SRI 5 = 8.7% p=0.23; SRI-7 =16.3% p=0.003; SRI-8 =17.4% p=0.001).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S6	Blisibimod was also effective in a subgroup of patients with severe lupus with baseline SELENA- SLEDAI 10 and receiving corticosteroids at any dose (n=278) utilizing more stringent response thresholds ( SRI-5=13.8%, p=0.18; SRI-6=15.9%, p=0.12; SRI-7=28.9%, p=0.002; SRI- 8=31.1%, p 0.001, Figure 3 and Table 1).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S7	Based on SELENA SLEDAI definitions, 76 subjects (13.9%) had renal involvement at baseline and 54 subjects had proteinuria equivalent 1g/24hr.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S8	Compared with baseline, decreases in proteinuria were observed with blisibimod from Week 12 through Week 52 in the subgroup of subjects with proteinuria equivalent 1 g/24hr at enrollment (Figure 4).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S9	Similarly, decreases in proteinuria were observed in subjects with proteinuria equivalent 0.5 g/24hr through Week 44.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P85_S10	Significantly greater reductions in proteinuria were also observed in a subgroup of subjects with active inflammation (i.e. low C3) and high anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	Secondary endpoints included safety, improvements in variant forms of the SRI (e.g. defined by greater improvements in SELENA-SLEDAI), effects on clinical response in subgroup of patients with greater baseline disease severities, time to lupus disease flare, improvements in proteinuria, improvements in biomarkers of inflammation (e.g. anti-dsDNA, complement C3 and C4), and changes in B-cell counts.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	In June of 2012 we completed dosing in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Using a higher treatment threshold of an six-point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI, or an SRI-6 endpoint, in this enhanced subgroup population, the 200mg blisibimod treatment group demonstrated a 15.9% treatment difference compared to regimen-matched placebo (54.2% versus 46.4%, p=0.12).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	In this severe subgroup, separation of clinical response was evident as early as Week 8 and numerical improvements relative to placebo were maintained beyond Week 24.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	This severe subgroup is the population that we believe will benefit most from treatment with blisibimod, and is the population we are enrolling in our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P88_S3	Significant and early decreases in proteinuria were also observed with blisibimod as early as Week 8 in subjects with baseline proteinuria equivalent 1g/24 hrs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P88_S4	Consistent pharmacodynamics responses were noted with blisibimod including reductions of B-cells, double-stranded-DNA antibodies and increases in complement C3 and C4.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	In addition to publications in earlier abstracts at key international rheumatology conferences, the efficacy and safety data from the PEARL-SC study were published by Dr. Richard Furie and colleagues ( Ann Rheum Dis . 2015), and Dr. Scheinberg ( International Journal of Clinical Rheumatology , 2014).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	Additional information and publications from the PEARL-SC study can be found at http://www.anthera.com/pipeline/clinical-studies/past-studies/pearl-sc.html.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file or furnish with the SEC.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	In the above figure, an SRI-6 responder achieved all of the following: 6 point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, and no new BILAG 1A or 2B organ domain scores, and no worsening ( 0.3 increase) in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	In a subgroup analysis of patients with severe lupus disease (SELENA SLEDAI 10 and receiving steroid at baseline, n=278), the percent of subjects achieving the SRI-5 was higher in subjects receiving the highest dose of blisibimod (200mg QW) compared with placebo.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	The graph shows data for blisibimod (200mg QW) and regimen matched placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks (Furie et al., Ann Rheum Dis . 2014).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	Analyses were conducted in the subgroup of subjects with more severe lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI score 10) at enrollment.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	SLE Responder Index (SRI) is defined as patients who respond to treatment and achieve a reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI equal to or greater than the number indicated, no new BILAG 1A or 2B organ domain scores, and no increase in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of greater than 0.3 on a three point scale.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	In subjects with baseline urinary protein excretion equivalent to 1-6g/24hrs (measured as urinary protein:creatinine ratio 1-6 mg/mg), treatment with blisibimod resulted in significantly greater reductions in proteinuria compared to placebo from Week 8 through Week 24.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	Furthermore, the observed treatment-related decreases in proteinuria resulted in near normalization of the proteinuria to 1g/24hrs in those subjects receiving blisibimod, and were durable through 52 weeks of continuous blisibimod dosing in the PEARL-SC and open-label extension studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	Figure 4 shows data from subgroups of patients defined by baseline proteinuria for blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	Separately, data are shown for the subgroup of subjects with high inflammatory biomarker status at enrollment, defined by low C3 and high anti-dsDNA autoantibodies at baseline.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P96_S2	Data are plotted for all pooled blisibimod dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P96_S3	See data presented by Dr. Richard Furie at the European League Against Rheumatology Annual Conference, Madrid, Spain 2013 in Figure 4.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	In this study, statistically significant reductions in total B-cells were observed in patients treated with blisibimod compared with placebo due to its mechanism of BAFF inhibition.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	In addition, treatment with blisibimod was associated with significant improvements in lupus disease activity and lupus biomarkers, including anti-dsDNA antibodies, proteinuria, immunoglobulins IgG and IgM, and complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P97_S2	Lupus biomarker observations from the PEARL-SC trial are summarized in the next section, Open-Label Extension Study in Patients Enrolled in PEARL-SC Study , along with data from the open-label extension study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated in this study, with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events or infections compared with placebo.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	Amongst the adverse events reported, only injection site reactions were more frequent with blisibimod than placebo; these were never serious or severe.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	The effects of blisibimod on patient-reported fatigue were evaluated in the PEARL-SC study using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale, and reported by Dr. Michelle Petri at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, Boston MA, 2014.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	Improvements in patient self-reported fatigue were observed amongst subjects randomized to blisibimod based on the FACIT-Fatigue scale as shown in Figure 5, especially in the 200mg QW group (N=80) where favorable effects of blisibimod compared with placebo were observed as early as Week 8, and a mean 6.9-point improvement from baseline was reported at Week 24 compared to 4.4 with placebo (N=229).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	These effects meet the criteria for minimal clinically-important improvement difference of 5.9 defined by Goligher and colleagues (2008) for patients with SLE.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	In order to evaluate longer-term safety of blisibimod, patients with lupus who completed the PEARL-SC study were able to participate in an OLE study in which they were treated with blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P100_S1	The OLE study was opened in the second quarter of 2011 and closed in the second quarter of 2013 after subjects had completed a minimum of one year of continuous therapy with blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P100_S2	Interim data from the combined PEARL-SC and OLE studies were presented at the 2013 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology and Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ACR/ARHP).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P100_S3	In addition, a case report was published summarizing observations in a patient who was randomized to placebo in the PEARL-SC study then experienced a rapid improvement in serum cryoglobulins upon initiation of blisibimod therapy in the OLE study (Golima et al., Rheumatology , 2013).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	The emerging data for the OLE study corroborate the effects of 24-week therapy with blisibimod observed in the PEARL-SC study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	Specifically, the improvements in proteinuria observed in the subgroup of patients with abnormal proteinuria at enrollment were maintained over 52 weeks of continuous blisibimod therapy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	In addition, the effects observed with blisibimod on peripheral B-cells, anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, and complement C3 and C4 and immunoglobulins IgG and IgM observed over 24 weeks of dosing in the PEARL-SC study were found to be durable over 52 weeks of therapy through the OLE study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P101_S3	Blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels through the PEARL-SC and OLE studies, with no associated increase in risk of severe infection as illustrated in the following table.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	The data from the Phase 2b (PEARL-SC) clinical program with blisibimod support the ongoing exploration of blisibimod s efficacy and safety in the Phase 3 study in patients with lupus (CHABLIS-SC1) as well as the clinical study in patients with IgA nephropathy (BRIGHT-SC).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	Additional information for the OLE clinical studies can be found at http://www.anthera.com/pipeline/clinical-studies/past-studies/open-label-extension-study.html.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file or furnish with the SEC.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	The significant improvements in proteinuria in patients with lupus randomized to blisibimod compared with placebo observed in the PEARL-SC study were found to be durable through their continuing exposure to blisibimod in the OLE study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	Figure 6 shows data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial, and interim data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52 (presented by Dr. Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego, 2013).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	As expected for its mechanism of BAFF inhibition, blisibimod treatment was associated with significant reductions in the numbers of total B-cells, anti-dsDNA antibodies, as well as significant increases in complement components C3 and C4.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P106_S1	In addition, significant reductions in immunoglobulins IgG and IgM were observed with blisibimod compared with placebo during the placebo-controlled PEARL-SC study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P106_S2	The effects of blisibimod on lupus biomarkers and serum immunoglobulins observed in the PEARL-SC study were found to be durable in subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P106_S3	The effects on immunoglobulins were not associated with infection risk, nor were alterations in white blood cells, monocytes, or neutrophils associated with blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	Figure 7 show data for blisibimod (all pooled dose levels as well as 200mg once-weekly) and placebo administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks in the PEARL-SC trial, and data for subjects who continued to receive blisibimod through the OLE trial are presented through Week 52 (interim data presented by Dr. Furie at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, San Diego 2013).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P108_S1	Prior to our in-licensing of blisibimod, our licensor, Amgen, completed two Phase 1 clinical studies of blisibimod in lupus patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of the drug using intravenous and subcutaneous formulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P108_S2	The randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1a clinical study evaluated blisibimod or placebo as a single intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 54 lupus patients.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P108_S3	Intravenous doses included 1, 3 and 6mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3mg/kg.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of single dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P109_S1	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P109_S2	Results from this clinical study indicated the safety and tolerability of blisibimod administered as a single intravenous or subcutaneous dose were comparable to placebo.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	Single doses of blisibimod exhibited linear pharmacokinetics after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P110_S1	There were comparable adverse events between the blisibimod and placebo groups with no deaths reported.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P110_S2	In addition, no neutralization antibodies were seen across all doses.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	The most common adverse events were nausea (15%), headache (10%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%) and diarrhea (8%).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P111_S1	Observations from this trial were published in 2015 (Stohl and colleagues, Arthritis Research Therapy ).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P112_S0	Blisibimod was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study as an intravenous or subcutaneous therapy among 64 lupus patients.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P112_S1	The intravenous dose was 6mg/kg, and subcutaneous doses included 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P112_S2	Patients received their doses of blisibimod or placebo once-weekly for four weeks.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P112_S3	The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple dose administrations of blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P112_S4	Secondary endpoints were designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of blisibimod after multiple doses.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P113_S0	Blisibimod exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after repeat intravenous and subcutaneous administration.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P113_S1	Further, a significant decrease in total B-cells as early as 15 days after beginning treatment, and total B-cell reduction (up to approximately 60-70% of baseline) reached its nadir after about 160 days of therapy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P113_S2	By six months after beginning treatment, the B-cell populations had returned to baseline levels.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P113_S3	Further analyses of B-cell subsets found that naive B-cells and activated B-cells were significantly decreased while memory B-cells were transiently significantly increased following treatment with blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P114_S0	There were no deaths reported between the blisibimod and placebo groups.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P115_S0	Few neutralization antibodies were seen, and all resolved in subsequent visits.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P115_S1	Observations from this trial were published in 2015 (Stohl and colleagues, Arthritis Research Therapy ).
1316175_16_ITEM1_P116_S0	Based on these results and published data from competitor studies, we conducted a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating blisibimod in lupus patients from the second half of 2010 to the third quarter of 2012.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P117_S0	Since our inception in 2004, we have focused primarily on developing our product candidates, which currently include liprotamase and blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P117_S1	We currently focus our clinical development and research efforts on liprotamase, as an enzyme replacement therapy for EPI, and blisibimod, which is being developed for autoimmune disease, including lupus and IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P117_S2	In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $33.6 million, $21.8 million and $21.7 million, respectively, of research and development expense.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P118_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including enzyme replacement therapies and autoimmune diseases.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P118_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P119_S0	We are advancing the development of liprotamase in a Phase 3 registration program in patients with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P119_S1	We are also advancing the development of blisibimod to evaluate the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P119_S2	We have completed a Phase 2b clinical study with blisibimod in patients with lupus and plan to continue the advancement of blisibimod in our ongoing Phase 3 registration program in lupus and development in IgA nephropathy in 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P119_S3	We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of liprotamase and blisibimod, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P120_S0	Our product candidates are focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as cystic fibrosis specialists, rheumatologists and nephrologists.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P120_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P121_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P121_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P121_S2	Our primary competitors are described in further detail below, under Approved Categories of Drugs .
1316175_16_ITEM1_P121_S3	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P122_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P122_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P122_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P122_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P122_S4	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P123_S0	There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis, including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pertzye by Cornestone Therapeutics, Inc., and Ultresa and Zenpep by Aptalis Pharma US.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P123_S1	Alcresta recently gained marketing approval for its product, Relizorb, which utilizes a digestive lipase enzyme, and is designed for use by adults on enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing dietary fats.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P124_S0	We are aware of one company with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH Co. KG s compound, Burlulipase (also known as NM-BL), recently completed a Phase 1/Phase 2 study in patients with EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P125_S0	Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and partner GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) obtained FDA approval for Benlysta (belimumab) in 2011 for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P125_S1	Benlysta , the first novel therapy approved in the last 50 years, was acquired by GSK in July 2012.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P125_S2	Other current therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, corticosteroids, anti-malarials and immunosuppressants are generally associated with limited efficacy or significant adverse events and broad immune suppression.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P126_S0	Emerging data from 2 large Phase 3 trials with the BAFF-targeted monoclonal antibody, tabalumab, were presented by Professor David Isenberg at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Conference, Boston, MA, November 2014.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P126_S1	These data demonstrate that targeting BAFF remains an effective strategy for improving chronic disease activity in SLE.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P126_S2	Several other agents under development target other B-cell related pathways or other inflammatory mechanisms for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P126_S3	These product candidates include atacicept, or TACI-Ig, from ZymoGenetics Inc. and anifrolumab from AstraZeneca, Other pathways targeting both B-cell and non-B-cell mechanisms are in earlier-phase clinical trials, such as Lupuzor from ImmuPharma plc; the anti-IFN gamma antibody AMG 811; toll-like receptor inhibitors; the anti-interleukin 6 antibodies sirukumab and PF-04236921; the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor CC-10004; the anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody milatuzumab; and inhibition of B7 related protein (B7RP-1) pathway with AMG 557.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P126_S4	We believe that blisibimod may offer potential differentiation from these agents, including focused evaluation on the populations of lupus patients who were identified in prior trials with BAFF inhibitors to be responsive to this treatment modality; selective modulation and reduction of relevant B-cell types in lupus patients; the ability to inhibit the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF; the use of a bacterial expression platform which is expected to translate to lower manufacturing costs compared with therapeutic antibodies; and distinct patent protection based on a novel and proprietary technology developed and commercialized by Amgen.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P127_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P127_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P130_S0	As of the date of this report, our liprotomase portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly, including:
1316175_16_ITEM1_P131_S0	Three pending non-EP foreign patent application.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Eli Lilly to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S1	The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in March 2025 and July 2028.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S2	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of liprotamase, one of these U.S. patents may be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S3	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S4	This could extend the expiration date of the selected U.S. Patent to as late as March 2030 or July 2033, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S5	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S6	The three exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire between February 2021 and October 2025.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P132_S7	One of these patents may be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to between February 2026 and October 2030.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P133_S0	As of the date of this report, our blisibimod patent portfolio includes:
1316175_16_ITEM1_P134_S0	Four pending non-EP foreign patent applications in Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Poland.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P135_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Amgen to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P135_S1	In addition, we hold a non-exclusive worldwide license to one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, one pending EP patent application, and over 50 non-EP foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to general peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P136_S0	The four exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022, March 2023 and November 2023.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P137_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P137_S1	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P137_S2	This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to as late as May 2027, March 2028 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P137_S3	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P137_S4	The exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P137_S5	One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P138_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P138_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P138_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P138_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P139_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P139_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P140_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P140_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P140_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P141_S0	We are aware of two families of third-party U.S. patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P141_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P141_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P141_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P141_S4	If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and possibly requiring us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P141_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P142_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009 and November 2014 (as amended, the Amgen Agreement ), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P143_S0	Under the Amgen Agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing blisibimod, as well as the right to grant sublicenses.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P143_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P143_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P143_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P144_S0	During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P144_S1	Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than blisibimod that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P145_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Agreement, we have paid $6.0 million in license fees to Amgen for blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P145_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States, European Union or Japan.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P145_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P145_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P145_S4	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P146_S0	The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P146_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P147_S0	In connection with the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku, we amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of our collaboration with Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by us to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P147_S1	Under this amendment, we also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of our common stock equal $1 .0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P147_S2	We issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015 pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement .
1316175_16_ITEM1_P148_S0	On July 11, 2014, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly (the Lilly Agreement ), to develop and commercialize liprotamase, a Phase 3 novel investigational PERT for the treatment of patients with EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P148_S1	Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we were not required to make any up-front payment but we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P148_S2	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P148_S3	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P149_S0	On December 11, 2014, we entered into the Zenyaku Agreement with Zenyaku, pursuant to which we granted Zenyaku an exclusive license to certain patent rights, know-how and other intellectual property relating to blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P149_S1	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P149_S2	The termination was at will and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P149_S3	We did not incur any termination penalties in connection with the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement by Zenyaku.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P149_S4	As of the date of termination, no patients had been enrolled in any blisibimod clinical studies in the Zenyaku territory and Zenyaku had not purchased any blisibimod product from us.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P149_S5	As a result of the termination on January 7, 2016, we regained full worldwide rights for blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P150_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current GMP with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P150_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P150_S2	Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce product candidates provide us with faulty products or such products are later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P151_S0	Our contract manufacturers obtain the raw materials for the drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies from a variety of sources.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P151_S1	We believe that this will provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials and drug product to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P151_S2	We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical systems, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P152_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P152_S1	Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P152_S2	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by local, state and federal regulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P153_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P153_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P153_S2	In order to commercialize our product candidates, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P153_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidates alone.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P153_S4	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in international markets.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P154_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidates to market.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P154_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P154_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P155_S0	Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P155_S1	Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process, and our biological product candidate, blisibimod, must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P156_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P156_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P156_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P156_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P157_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_16_ITEM1_P158_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P159_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S4	Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S5	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S6	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P160_S7	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P161_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P161_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P161_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P161_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P161_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P161_S5	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P162_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_16_ITEM1_P163_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P163_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P164_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P165_S0	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P165_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P166_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P166_S1	Safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 days after the sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator s brochure.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P166_S2	A sponsor also must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 days after the sponsor s receipt of the information.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P166_S3	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P166_S4	The FDA , a data safety monitoring board, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P166_S5	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P167_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P167_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidates and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P167_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P168_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P168_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P169_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P169_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P169_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P170_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P170_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P170_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P170_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P171_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P171_S1	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP- compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P171_S2	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P172_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P172_S1	The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P172_S2	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P172_S3	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P172_S4	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P173_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P173_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P173_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P173_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P173_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P173_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P173_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P174_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P174_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P174_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P175_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P175_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P175_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P175_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P175_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P175_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P175_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P176_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S6	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P177_S7	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P178_S0	HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P178_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P178_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P179_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P179_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P179_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P180_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P180_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P180_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P180_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P181_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P181_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P181_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if any of our product candidates is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P181_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P182_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P182_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P183_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P183_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P184_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P184_S1	Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P185_S0	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P185_S1	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P186_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P186_S1	A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P186_S2	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P186_S3	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P187_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well- controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P187_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P187_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P188_S0	The FDA Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA includes a provision that allows sponsors to request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P188_S1	The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P188_S2	The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable, (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P189_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record- keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P190_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P190_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P190_S2	Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P190_S3	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P191_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P191_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P191_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P192_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P192_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P193_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P193_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P194_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P194_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P194_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P195_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P196_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P196_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P197_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P197_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P197_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P197_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P198_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P198_S1	European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P199_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P199_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P199_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P200_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P200_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P200_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P200_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P200_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including, at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S3	However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S6	Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S7	It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P201_S8	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P202_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P202_S1	For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P202_S2	Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P202_S3	Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P202_S4	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P202_S5	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P202_S6	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P203_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P203_S1	Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P203_S2	Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P203_S3	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P203_S4	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P203_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P203_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P204_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P204_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P204_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P204_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P205_S0	There are also laws that govern a company s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P205_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company s ability to operate its business.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P206_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P206_S1	We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P206_S2	Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P206_S3	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P206_S4	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P206_S5	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P207_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P208_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P209_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P210_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P210_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P210_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P210_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P210_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P210_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P211_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had 25 employees.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P211_S1	All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P211_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P212_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P212_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P212_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P213_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware in 2004.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P213_S1	The mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P214_S0	Through a link on the Investors section of our website (under SEC Filings in the Financial Information section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_16_ITEM1_P214_S1	Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with two clinical assets in the late stage of development.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2004.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $352.0 million.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Substantially all of our losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We expect to incur additional losses over the next several years, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate revenues.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have never generated any product revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct clinical studies in patients, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Although we recognized collaborative revenues from our license agreement with Zenyaku in 2015, we cannot guarantee we will recognize collaborative revenue in the future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized collaborative revenue related to the amortization of upfront license fee and reimbursement for our internal full time equivalent ( FTE ) employee and certain research and development expenses by Zenyaku.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	The termination was at will and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	As a result of an early termination the Zenyaku Agreement, we do not expect to recognize revenues under the Zenyaku Agreement beyond January 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We have not generated any revenue from our development-stage product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P7_S7	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our product candidates could fail in clinical studies if we are unable to demonstrate that it is effective or if it causes unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Failure of our product candidates in clinical studies would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	As of the date of this report, we anticipate that our existing cash and access to additional capital through an equity purchase agreement and an at-the-market sales agreement are sufficient to fund our near term liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	terminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for sale.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to our licensors is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In December 2007, we entered into the Amgen Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low teens as net sales increase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In July 2014, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Pursuant to the Lilly Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives for any liprotamase formulation.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We are also required to make tiered royalty payments on net sales, which percentage increases from the high single digits to the mid-teens as net sales increase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ( CFFT ) for the development of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Under the research award agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the five times the award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to our licensors is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of our product candidates, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and in the event we are unable to meet our debt obligations, the lenders could foreclose on our assets.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As a part of our financing strategy, we have in the past and we may in the future enter into credit agreements with lenders.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In connection with these credit agreements, our debt obligations to the lenders could:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors who are not similarly restricted.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may be required to pledge substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under credit agreements in the future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In the event that we were to fail to make any required payment under any credit agreement, or fail to comply with the covenants contained in the any credit agreement and other related agreements, we may be in default regarding that indebtedness.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	A debt default would enable the lender to foreclose on the assets securing such debt and could significantly diminish the market value and marketability of our common stock and could result in the acceleration of the payment obligations under all or a portion of our consolidated indebtedness.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, conducting product development activities for our primary product candidates, liprotamase and blisibimod, and performing research and development.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our product candidates which are still under clinical development.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well- controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidates are safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until the U.S. FDA approves our biologics license applications, or BLAs, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We have not submitted any BLA or received marketing approval for our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the U.S. FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	The U.S. FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	From time to time during the regulatory approval process of our product candidates, we engage in discussions with the U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We may receive informal verbal and or written guidance from these authority agencies which may help form the basis of our clinical trial designs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory agencies may change their position on such informal guidance prior to the approval of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	As a result, we are unable to determine whether the outcome of informal deliberations will become final.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with inquires and requests from the U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value maybe be reduced.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospect.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the U.S. FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Product development costs to us will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidates or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delays outside our control.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical development plans or clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for re- examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidates, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidates have performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain U.S. FDA approval for our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we breach the license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are party to the Amgen Agreement, which provides for the exclusive worldwide licenses of the compositions of matter and methods of use for blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive worldwide licenses of compositions of matter and methods of use relating to peptibodies generally.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We are also party to the Lilly Agreement, which provides for an exclusive worldwide license of the compositions of matter, formulation, and methods of use patents for liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These agreements require us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify our licensors under the terms of the agreements.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors may terminate our licenses and may be able to re-obtain licensed technologies and aspects of any intellectual properties controlled by us that relate to the licensed technologies that originated from our licensors.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of the licensed product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreements.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents and patent applications licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the license agreements could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The market for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is also highly competitive.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis, including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pertzye by Cornestone Therapeutics, Inc., and Ultresa and Zenpep by Aptalis Pharma US.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We are also aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: Johnson and Johnson Research and Development LLC recently completed a Phase 3 study to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral pancrelipase MT in the treatment of adult and pediatric/adolescent cystic fibrosis patients with clinical symptoms of EPI; and Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH Co. KG s compound, Burlulipase, is being tested in a Phase 3 study in patients with EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The market for inflammatory disease therapeutics is especially large and competitive.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	For lupus, GlaxoSmithKline plc s BAFF antagonist monoclonal antibody, Benlysta , was approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In 2015, new efficacy data with a subcutaneous presentation of Benlysta were presented, along with safety and pharmacokinetics data for an autoinjector for the subcutaneous product.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We assume that these presentations will become commercially-available in the future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Further, we are aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of lupus: AstraZeneca is conducting 3 Phase 3 trials in lupus and lupus nephritis with their drug candidate, anifrolumab, Merck Serono S.A., whose dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist fusion protein, Atacicept, recently completed a Phase 2/3 clinical study for lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	In addition, other companies including Janssen, Pfizer, have completed Phase 2 trials in lupus and may continue to advance their clinical development in lupus.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, and in obtaining U.S. FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining U.S. FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidates we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P49_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Phase 2 clinical studies conducted by us with blisibimod have generated differences in adverse effects and serious adverse events.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The most common adverse effects seen with our product candidates versus placebo include injection site erythema and nasopharyngitis.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S3	The most common serious adverse events seen with blisibimod include Herpes zoster, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis, intervertebral disc protrusion, spontaneous abortion, and kidney stones.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S4	During the placebo-controlled Phase 2 PEARL study, blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events or infections between blisibimod and placebo.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Discontinuation due to adverse event was lower amongst blisibimod-treated subjects (5.7%) compared to placebo (7.9%).
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Amongst the commonly-reported adverse events, imbalance was observed only with injection site reactions (200mg QW blisibimod = 15%, matched placebo = 7%), but these were not serious or severe and did not result in discontinuation of treatment.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Studies conducted by our licensor on liprotamase have generated the following common adverse effects: general gastrointestinal disorder, such as abdominal pain, flatulence, loose stools and diarrhea.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our second product candidate, liprotamase, which we licensed from Eli Lilly in July 2014, received a complete response letter ( CRL ) from the U.S. FDA while it was under development by Eli Lilly in April 2011.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Eli Lilly has attempted to address the material items highlighted by the FDA in the CRL and worked directly with the U.S. FDA on a clinical development program for liprotamase which, if successful, could result in regulatory approval of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	There are still open items from the CRL that we will need to address with the U.S. FDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	While we plan to make reasonable efforts to accommodate and address the U.S. FDA s inquires and request, we are unable to determine the final outcome of the CRL.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Any delay in addressing the CRL to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA may result in postponement of our Phase 3 clinical trial of liprotamase in patients with EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If serious adverse events that are considered related to our product candidates are observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Further, if our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidates and could substantially increase the costs of commercialization.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from the product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize any product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidate.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we develop.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in U.S. FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and U.S. FDA regulatory review.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the U.S. FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	For example, the label ultimately approved for blisibimod or liprotamase, if any, may include restrictions on use.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Further, the U.S. FDA has indicated that long-term safety data on blisibimod may need to be obtained as a post-market requirement.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing U.S. FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P59_S5	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with our product candidates, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the products are manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the products, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the products from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P59_S6	If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	New legal and regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain approvals for our product candidates and could limit or make more burdensome our ability to commercialize any approved products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	New federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	New legislation, and the additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidates, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from their sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The degree of market acceptance of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third- party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Paul F. Truex, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Craig Thompson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Colin Hislop, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Chuck Olson, our Chief Technology Officer, and Ms. Klara Dickinson-Eason, our Chief Regulatory Officer, and the other principal members of our executive team.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P69_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for any product we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Also in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P75_S3	As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P75_S4	These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third- party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, the Health Care Reform Law and additional prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P77_S4	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P77_S5	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the EU and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The use of product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P81_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	decreased demand for product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If and when we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P86_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P86_S3	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P89_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P89_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P89_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P89_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P91_S2	If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates or market them.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P92_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the U.S. FDA to withdraw approvals previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce drug product for our clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	There are a small number of suppliers, and in some instances, a single supplier for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture drug product.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials and equipment to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P93_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials and equipment by our manufacturers.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of product candidates to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of product candidates or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P93_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained, the commercial launch would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of such product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P94_S1	If we successfully commercialize a product candidate, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P94_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P94_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, which may not occur on a timely basis.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Some of our manufacturing suppliers are located overseas, and the transportation of drug supplies to or from these facilities to their intended destinations is subject to certain risks of loss and damage beyond our control.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Additionally, the importation of drug supplies into and from foreign countries is subject to customs regulations that may require us to incur additional regulatory costs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the U.S. FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P97_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P97_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P97_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	G uidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P99_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If our or our licensors patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidates or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We hold license rights to numerous U.S. European Patents ( EP ), and non-EP foreign patents and patent applications relating to blisibimod and liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our liprotomase portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Our blisibimod portfolio is made up of exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen, Inc.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P102_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P105_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We are aware of two families of third party United States patents and pending foreign applications that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P108_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P108_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P108_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P108_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P110_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P110_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P110_S3	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P110_S4	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P110_S5	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P110_S6	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P111_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the novel BAFF inhibitor blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P112_S1	We are also a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize liprotamase, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to liprotamase compositions and formulations.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering blisibimod and liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P113_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P113_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P113_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P113_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P113_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P114_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P115_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and to obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P116_S0	The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in the regulatory approval process.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Assuming we gain a five-year patent term extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2027 or 2028.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P117_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Assuming we gain such a five-year extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s European new chemical entity patents until 2027.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Further, since blisibimod has not been previously approved, blisibimod could be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity from the U.S. FDA.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P117_S3	During the data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small molecule compound or biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that compound or biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P118_S1	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P118_S2	However, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P118_S3	If we fail to receive such Hatch-Waxman extensions or marketing exclusivity rights or if we receive extensions that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P119_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We typically develop product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P120_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P120_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P121_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P121_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P122_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P122_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P122_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P123_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P125_S1	If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidates and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P126_S2	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P126_S3	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors existing or future patents.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P128_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P129_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P129_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P131_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P132_S0	discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P133_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P133_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P133_S5	These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P134_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P134_S1	We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P134_S2	Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention from our business.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Because a small number of our existing stockholders own a material amount of our voting stock, your ability to influence corporate matters will be limited.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 27.63% of our outstanding common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P136_S1	As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to influence our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P136_S2	These persons will also have the ability to influence our management and business affairs.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P136_S3	This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P138_S0	As of December 31, 2015, there were 40,004,037 shares of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P138_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase 4,296,159 shares of our common stock that, if exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P138_S2	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P138_S3	Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P138_S4	Moreover, certain holders of shares of common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P139_S0	We have registered or will register all common stock that we may issue under our 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan ), our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan ) and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P139_S1	As of December 31, 2015, an aggregate of 729,492 shares of our common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, plus any shares cancelled under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Plan, and an aggregate of 55,929 shares of common stock have been reserved for future issuance under our ESPP.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P139_S2	These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P139_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P140_S0	In addition, we may sell shares of stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement with LPC executed in March 2015, pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $6.0 million of common stock until March 2017.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P140_S1	We may also sell shares of stock pursuant to a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen ) pursuant to an at-the-market equity program ( ATM ) under which we may from time to time offer and sell up to $25.0 million shares of our common stock, $3.2 million of which remained available to be sold as of the date of this report.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P140_S2	Finally, we maintain an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC for the issuance and sale from time to time of up to approximately $1.2 million of our equity and debt securities, which will expire in April 2016 and which we may replace at any time.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We will need to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P142_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P143_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P145_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P145_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P145_S2	For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P145_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P146_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P146_S1	We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P146_S2	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P146_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P147_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P148_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P148_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P151_S0	the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P152_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P152_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P152_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P154_S1	An ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P154_S2	We underwent an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 ownership of the Internal Revenue Code during 2012 and as such, our net operating loss carryforwards are limited.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P154_S3	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_16_ITEM1A_P154_S4	If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We occupy approximately 14,000 square feet under a facility lease agreement that expires in September 2017.
1316175_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe our existing facility is adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not subject to any material pending legal proceedings.
1316175_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol ANTH since our initial public offering ( IPO ).
1316175_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that offering, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Market:
1316175_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2015, an aggregate of 40,004,037 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by 55 registered holders, based on information provided by the Company s transfer agent.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	A significantly larger number of stockholders may be "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III, Item 12 of this report.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	All information under this Item has been previously reported on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC.
1316175_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	We did not repurchase any securities during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables reflect selected consolidated summary financial data for each of the last five fiscal years and are derived from our audited financial statements.
1316175_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	This data should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from CFFT for our development of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $2.6 million in research award from CFFT in connection with achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM6_P1_S2	The amount has been recognized as a component of Operating Expenses.
1316175_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We currently have two compounds in development, liprotamase and blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	We licensed liprotamase from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014 .
1316175_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Liprotamase is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates, and since inception we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, debt financing, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a former collaborative partner, Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd ( Zenyaku ), and a research award from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT").
1316175_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P8_S5	In addition to the normal risks associated with drug development companies, we may never successfully complete development of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P8_S6	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	In December 2014, we entered in an exclusive license agreement with Zenyaku for the development and commercialization of blisibimod in Japan and potentially other countries throughout Asia.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	The termination was at will and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	There are no termination penalties incurred by us in connection with the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	As a result of the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement, we do not expect to recognize revenues under the Zenyaku Agreement beyond January 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	We also regained full worldwide rights for blisibimod and we are actively pursuing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to further advance the development of blisibimod globally.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from CFFT for our development of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	We retain the right to develop and commercialize liprotamase and will owe royalties to CFFT on net sales of any drug candidate approved and commercialized under the collaboration.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The funding is to be disbursed by CFFT to us upon our achievement of milestones specified in the agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	At our discretion, we may choose to fund a particular stage of the liprotamase development plan without CFFT funds.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	Any CFFT funds not expended on the development program of liprotamase must be returned to CFFT and, upon such return, the amounts of such returned funds will not be included as part of the research award for the purpose of calculating royalties or other amounts owed by us to CFFT.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	To the extent CFFT provides or makes available any information, expertise, know-how or other intellectual property related to cystic fibrosis or the treatment, prevention or cure thereof ( CFFT Know-How ) to us, CFFT grants to us a non-exclusive, transferrable, sublicensable, worldwide rights and license under all of CFFT s rights in such CFFT Know-How to assist us to research, develop, commercialize, make or have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import, export and otherwise exploit the product.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	We initiated the SOLUTION study in the third quarter of 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	SOLUTION is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of liprotamase in patients with cystic fibrosis-related exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	This pivotal study is intended to evaluate the non-inferiority of liprotamase compared with another commercially available PERT in a population enriched for PERT responders and will enroll approximately 130 patients in the United States and Europe.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	A second, smaller Phase 3 study, SIMPLICITY, in younger pediatric subjects is planned for initiation in first half of 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	The SIMPLICITY study will use sachets containing a formulation of liprotamase powder for oral solution for ease of administration, and will enroll approximately 60 patients.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	We believe the SOLUTION and SIMPLICITY studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed PERTs, including:
1316175_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	a capsule formulation using known, safe, excipients that provides lower pill burden and good delivery performance.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	a sachet formulation containing liprotamase power for oral solution which can be easily dissolved into water, and finally provides patients, especially young pediatric patients, with an easy-to-swallow dosing option.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	CHABLIS-SC1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with seropositive, clinically-active lupus (SELENA-SLEDAI 10) who require corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard-of-care for treatment of their disease.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The study was designed to randomize up to 400 patients to receive either 200mg of blisibimod or placebo in addition to their standard-of-care medication for 52 weeks.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	We reached the enrollment target in June 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	Topline data is expected after the last enrolled patient completes 52 weeks of treatment around the third quarter of 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	The primary endpoint of the CHABLIS-SC1 will be clinical improvement in the SRI-6 response at 52 weeks.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	Key secondary outcomes from the study, including SRI-8, reduction in the number of lupus flares and steroid use, are intended to further differentiate blisibimod from currently available therapies.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S6	To date, enrolled patient demographics and disease characteristics for the CHABLIS-SC1 study are consistent with our goal to enroll patients with higher levels of lupus activity and positive biomarkers despite the stable use of corticosteroids.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P15_S7	These characteristics were associated with improved outcomes in both our previous Phase 2 clinical study as well as in large Phase 3 studies conducted with other BAFF-inhibitors, belimumab (Benlysta) and tabalumab.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	We believe the CHABLIS development program for blisibimod may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed BAFF antagonist and other novel B-cell directed therapies, including:
1316175_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	fully human IgG1 Fc domain confers acceptable pharmacokinetic properties to support once-weekly dosing.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meets regularly over the course of the study to assess patient safety.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	During these regular meetings, the DSMB reviews un-blinded safety data which include adverse events, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or SUSARs, deaths, laboratory data, and withdrawal data and compares trends between treatments.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	After the most recent scheduled meeting in November 2015, the DSMB recommended continuing the CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	In February 2015, an interim analysis of CHABLIS-SC1 was conducted by an independent un-blinded statistician, who evaluated at a pre-specified time point, the proportion of responders to the systemic lupus erythematous SRI-6 responder index, and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	This futility analysis was not intended to provide any rules for stopping for overwhelming efficacy, for a change in study sample size, or for an alteration of the study design.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	Rather, the analysis suggests that the observed data conforms with the assumptions upon which the trial was designed.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The systemic lupus erythematosus response index is a recognized endpoint by the FDA for previously approved therapeutics.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Prior to the interim analysis and on the advice of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluated the published clinical data from other recent lupus studies with BAFF inhibitors, we modified the primary endpoint of CHABLIS-SC1 from a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-8 responder index to a comparison of the proportion of responders to the SRI-6 responder index (previously a secondary endpoint of the study) as data, including emerging observations with tabalumab (Isenberg et al ., Annual Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, November 2014), suggest that SRI-6 responder rates are consistent and stable across multiple trials.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	Response rates to the SRI-8 responder index will remain a key secondary endpoint of the study.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	In addition to serving as a registration study for a potential lupus indication, observations in this study are intended to be included in marketing applications for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy and other indications.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	We submitted a study protocol for our second lupus study, CHABLIS 7.5 (formerly named CHABLIS-SC2), to the FDA in the third quarter of 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The CHABLIS 7.5 study s name emphasizes the intent to reduce background corticosteroid medication to 7.5mg prednisone in order to mitigate the risks associated with long-term steroid medication.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	This study will evaluate the effect of blisibimod on top of standard-of-care medication in patients with severe, seropositive SLE that is inadequately controlled with corticosteroids.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Patient eligibility for this study is informed by responder traits identified in the Phase 2 trial with blisibimod as well as the large Phase 3 programs with other BAFF inhibitors, belimumab and tabalumab.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	We plan to initiate the CHABLIS 7.5 study in the first half of 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P21_S5	These two pivotal studies are anticipated to form the basis of submission for blisibimod as a treatment for active SLE that is not controlled by standard-of-care medication, including corticosteroids.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The BRIGHT-SC study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Enrollment criteria are biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr).
1316175_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Patients must be receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	The BRIGHT-SC study was initiated in the second quarter of 2013.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The BRIGHT-SC clinical study has enrolled patients in Southeast Asia, the European Union ( EU ) and Eastern Europe.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	In September 2013, we met with the U.S. FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as an endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	In this meeting we gained the PMDA s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan and have amended the BRIGHT-SC study to include the specific data requirements of the PMDA.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	We reached an agreement with the EMA on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable as well as the requirement for a single study in support a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application ( CMAA ) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study, would be available post approval.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P26_S5	The EMA also recommended the protocol to provide information on the recommended duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	In March 2015, an interim futility analysis of BRIGHT-SC study was conducted by an independent unblinded statistician, who evaluated several important biomarkers of renal disease in patients who had completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	We plan to conduct a six-month efficacy analysis in the first half of 2016 when approximately 40 patients have completed 6 months of treatment, followed by a topline analysis in the second half of 2016 when a majority of the patients have completed one year of treatment.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	However, as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod, we began recognizing license fee revenue and collaborative revenue in 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	The license fee from the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku was initially amortized as revenue over the performance obligation period (product development period) while reimbursement for our FTEs was recorded as collaborative revenues as incurred.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	In September 2015, we received a termination notice from Zenyaku to terminate the collaborative arrangement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P28_S4	Consequently, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period and have fully amortized our deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidates development programs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: licensing, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for the continued development of blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	We are developing our product candidates in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Includes reimbursed development costs totaling $1.5 million pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Included non-cash license fee $1.0 million in connection with an amendment to the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	We intend to fund our clinical studies with existing cash and proceeds from potential future debt and equity offerings.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	As we obtain results from clinical studies, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain clinical development programs in order to focus our resources on more promising clinical development programs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	Completion of clinical studies may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	The cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including:
1316175_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P38_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P38_S5	If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	None of our product candidates has received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions, including clinical, chemical manufacturing, regulatory, finance and business development.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	During 2015, we had a collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku which provided for various types of payments to us, including development milestones, sales milestone, royalty, and reimbursement for a portion of the Company s internal and external costs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	All payments from Zenyaku were nonrefundable.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The collaborative arrangement was on a best-efforts basis, did not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation and provided for payment to be made when costs were incurred or services were performed.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	The collaboration was terminated on January 7, 2016 pursuant to a termination notice from Zenyaku to us.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	With respect to the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku, we recognized revenue in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 605 Revenue Recognition , subtopic ASC 605-25 Revenue with Multiple Element Arrangements and subtopic ASC 605-28 Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method , which provide accounting guidance for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and guidance on defining the milestone and determining when the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions is appropriate, respectively.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	For multiple-element arrangements, each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our contro l.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	The deliverables under the Zenyaku agreement had been determined to be a single unit of accounting and as such any license fees received were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated performance period under the agreement, which was the product development period.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	As a result of the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period in the third quarter of 2015 and fully amortized our deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	For the collaborative research activities, we were entitled to reimbursement from Zenyaku for our internal personnel cost at a pre-determined full time equivalent ( FTE ) rate.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Revenue related to FTE services was recognized as research services that were performed over the related performance periods.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	We were required to perform research and development activities as specified in the collaboration agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The payments received were not refundable and were based on a contractual reimbursement rate per FTE working on the project.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	Reimbursement for FTE cost was recorded as collaborative revenue as incurred.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	We account for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our equity incentive plans under the provisions of ASC 718 which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	This model requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized ratably over the requisite service period of the award.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Due to the limited amount of historical data available to us, particularly with respect to stock-price volatility, employee exercise patterns and forfeitures, actual results could differ from our assumptions.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC 505, Equity.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	As a result, the non-cash charge to operations for non-employee options with service or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock, as the underlying equity instruments vest.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	The two factors which most affect these changes are the price of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock-based compensation is recorded and the volatility of the stock price.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	The majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P55_S4	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We base our accruals related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P57_S4	In accruing for service fees, we estimate the time and materials incurred by these service providers in each period.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P57_S5	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P57_S6	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We began to recognize revenues in 2015 as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $2.6 million for the amortization of the license fee and $0.6 million for the reimbursement of FTEs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	License fee from the collaborative arrangement is amortized over the period of performance (product development period) while reimbursement for our FTEs is recorded as collaborative revenue.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	In September 2015, we received a termination notice from Zenyaku to terminate the collaborative arrangement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P59_S4	Consequently, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period and have fully amortized our deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Research and development expenses increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation recognized in 2015 as a result of options issued in 2015 and higher expense in manufacturing and CRO fees to support the ongoing CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC studies and enable the initiation of our Phase 3 SOLUTION study with liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase is partially offset by $1.5 million in expense reimbursements from Zenyaku for certain development costs associated with blisibimod .
1316175_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	General and administrative expenses increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2015 as a result of options issued in 2015 and higher expense related to professional services to support the growth of the Company.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following table summarizes our research award for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from CFFT for our development of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $2.6 million in research award from CFFT in connection with achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	The amount has been recognized as a component of Operating Expenses.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	There was no research award recognized in 2014.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Income (expense) recorded in 2015 and 2014 was mainly a result of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the net impact of realized gain or loss from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	There was no interest expense recorded in 2015 due to the full payment of our long-term debt in 2014.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2014 included a non-cash charge of $1.0 million in license fee that we recognized in connection with an amendment to the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	Excluding this non-cash license fee, research and development decreased by $0.9 million in 2014 from 2013.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	The decrease in research and development expense was mainly due to a decrease in clinical development expense as fewer subjects were treated in our Phase 3 CHABLIS SC1 and Phase 2 BRIGHT-SC studies as compared the PEARL-SC and Open Label Extension studies in 2013.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The change in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 was insignificant as compared to the year ended in 2013.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	Other expense recorded in both 2014 and 2013 was a result of net loss realized from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	The decrease in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to the refinancing of our debt from Hercules to MidCap and Square 1 Bank in April 2013, which resulted in a significantly reduced interest rate, and repayment of our debts to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in October and December 2014, respectively.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt, debt financings and public offerings of common stock, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a collaborative partner, and a research award from CFFT.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $47.0 million.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, and our capital expenditure needs.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	On March 12, 2015, we executed an equity purchase agreement (as amended, the Purchase Agreement ), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC ) pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of common stock over a period of two years in amounts as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	In July 2015, we amended the Purchase Agreement and reduced the amount LPC can purchase to an aggregate of $6.0 million of common stock over a period of two years.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	No sales of common stock have been made under the Purchase Agreement as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	The Purchase Agreement will expire in March 2017.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	On November 15, 2013, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the Agreement ) with Cowen to create an at-the-market ( ATM ) offering program under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million through Cowen, as agent.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we have sold $21.8 million of common stock through the ATM program, of which $12.4 million was sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, leaving a balance of $3.2 million available for future sale pursuant to the Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	In April 2013, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-187780) for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	On November 15, 2013, we registered $25.0 million under the registration statement for the Cowen ATM.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	In 2015, we registered $10.0 million under the registration statement for the issuance of our common stock to Zenyaku and Amgen.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	In March 2015, we registered $10.3 million under the registration statement for the 2015 Purchase Agreement with LPC, which was subsequently reduced to $6.3 million in July 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	In March and July 2015, we utilized $57.5 million of this registration statement through the issuance of 10,222,223 shares of common stock in two separate public offerings.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P78_S5	As of December 31, 2015, there was $1.2 million available for future issuance under this shelf registration statement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P78_S6	The current shelf registration statement is scheduled to expire in April 2016 and we expect to file a replacement shelf registration statement to register up to $100.0 million of our securities prior to that date.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Based on the requirements of Form S-3, however, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock and our stock price, which may limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through the Purchase Agreement and registration statements described above.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	During 2015 and 2014, our operating activities used cash of $30.9 million and $25.6 million, respectively.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The increase in cash used for operating activities in 2015 was mainly attributable to higher research and development expense due to the continued advancement of blisibimod in the clinics and the launch of a new registration enabling trial with liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, investing activities used cash of $80,000 in capital expenditures.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014, investing activities provided cash of $10.0 million, which amount represented the release of $10.0 million in restricted cash as a result of repayment of our long-term debt to Square 1 Bank.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, financing activities provided cash of $75.3 million from the issuance of common stock through two rounds of public offerings, an ATM program, and equity investments by Zenyaku.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014, financing activities used cash of $7.7 million, which represented the net effect of $18.1 million used for the early retirement of our debt to MidCap, offset by $10.4 million in net proceeds received from the sale of stock to LPC and pursuant to an ATM program.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cash flow from operations during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	During 2014 and 2013, our operating activities used cash of $25.6 million and $31.9 million, respectively.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	The decrease in cash used in 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly attributable to lower research and development expense due to the Company focusing exclusively on the development of blisibimod and liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	In addition, interest expense also decreased significantly in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of our refinancing of our long-term debt from Hercules to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in early 2013 and repayment of our debts to Midcap and Square 1 Bank in October and December 2014, respectively.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, investing activities provided cash of $10.0 million, which amount represented the release of $10.0 million in restricted cash as a result of repayment of our long-term debt to Square 1 Bank.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, investing activities used cash of $4.7 million, which amount represented the effect of the establishment of $10.0 million in restricted cash for the Square 1 Bank debt, offset by proceeds of $5.3 million from the maturities of short-term investments.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, financing activities used cash of $7.7 million, which represented the net effect of $18.1 million used for the early retirement of our debt to MidCap, offset by $10.4 million in net proceeds received from the sale of stock to LPC and pursuant to the ATM.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, financing activities provided cash of $43.1 million, which represented the net effect of $45.7 million in net proceeds received from a public offering in January 2013 and $19.8 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable, offset by net principal payments of $22.4 million.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	We have lease obligations consisting of an operating lease for our operating facility that expires in September 2017.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The following table summarizes our estimated scheduled future minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	The above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidates in development, as these payments are not determinable.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Under the Amgen Agreement, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable on a country-by-country basis and licensed on a product-by-licensed-product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicensee in such country, or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Under the Lilly Agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens, for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Under the research award agreement with CFFT, we are obligated to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to five times the actual award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	To date, we have not generated any revenue.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidates into clinical studies and as we:
1316175_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	implement new operational, financial and management information systems.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	the acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	As of the filing of this report, we believe our existing cash, anticipated equity investment and access to an equity purchase agreement with LPC and our ATM program will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to conduct additional or extended clinical studies and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities, if convertible, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P99_S3	To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to terminate, significantly modify or delay our development programs, or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1316175_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1316175_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
1316175_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
1316175_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, since a majority of our investments are in highly liquid money market funds, we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure.
1316175_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any material derivative financial instruments.
1316175_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents was $47.0 million as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities.
1316175_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary.
1316175_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The consolidated financial statements required by this item are set forth beginning in Item 15 of this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive officer and Principal Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to that company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(e), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this report.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process, effected by an entity s board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures which pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management s and or the board of directors authorization; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material errors in our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with our policies and procedures may deteriorate.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .

1316175_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We reviewed the results of management s assessment with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P5_S5	BDO USA, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, which is included herein.
1316175_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P6_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P7_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P9_S0	We have audited Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P9_S1	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P10_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P10_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( the Company ) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	The Company currently has two compounds in development, liprotamase and blisibimod.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P19_S2	The Company licensed liprotamase from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	Liprotamase is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor or ( BAFF ) which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), or lupus, Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and others .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	The Company s planned principal operations are acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital and performing research and development activities.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company is currently conducting research and development activities to treat autoimmune diseases and EPI.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets; secure financing; develop a customer base; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and develop strategic alliances .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Since inception in 2004, the Company has funded its operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, debt financing, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a collaborative partner, and a research award from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT").
1316175_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	As of the date of this report, the Company anticipates its existing cash, and access to additional cash through an equity purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital ( LPC ) and an at-the-market ( ATM ) Sales Agreement with Cowen Company, LLC ( Cowen ) will be sufficient to fund its near term liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	To fully execute its business plan, the Company will need to complete certain research and development activities and clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	Further, the Company s product candidates will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	These activities may span many years and require substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	Any delays in completing these activities could adversely impact the Company.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P26_S4	The Company will need substantial additional financing to conduct new trials in the development of its product candidates; such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P26_S5	The Company plans to meet its capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, debt financing, potential partnerships and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P26_S6	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	During 2015, the Company had a collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. ( Zenyaku ) which provided for various types of payments from Zenyaku, including development milestones, sales milestone, royalty, and reimbursement for a portion of the Company s internal and external costs.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	All payments from Zenyaku are nonrefundable.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P28_S2	The collaborative arrangement was on a best-efforts basis, did not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation and provided for payment to be made when costs were incurred or services were performed.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P28_S3	The collaboration was terminated on January 7, 2016 pursuant to a termination notice from Zenyaku to the Company.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	With respect to the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku, the Company recognized revenue in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 605 Revenue Recognition , subtopic ASC 605-25 Revenue with Multiple Element Arrangements and subtopic ASC 605-28 Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method , which provide accounting guidance for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and guidance on defining the milestone and determining when the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions is appropriate, respectively.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	For multiple-element arrangements, each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our contro l.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	The deliverables under the Zenyaku agreement had been determined to be a single unit of accounting and as such any license fees received were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated performance period under the agreement, which was the product development period.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	As a result of an early termination of the Zenyaku agreement, the Company revised the amortization period of its deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period in the third quarter of 2015 and had fully amortized its deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016 .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	For the collaborative research activities, the Company was entitled to reimbursement from Zenyaku for its internal personnel cost at a pre-determined full time equivalent ( FTE ) rate.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	Revenue related to FTE services was recognized as research services were performed over the related performance periods.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	The Company was required to perform research and development activities as specified in the collaboration agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P32_S3	The payments received were not refundable and were based on a contractual reimbursement rate per FTE working on the project.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P32_S4	Reimbursement for FTE costs was recorded as collaborative revenue as incurred .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical accounting policies or estimates related to clinical trial accruals, tax provision, stock-based compensation, allocation of consideration to various elements under multiple-element arrangement and recognition of revenue.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P33_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P33_S3	Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash currencies and money market funds, for which the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	The Company s cash equivalents consist of certificates of deposit with maturities less than three months and treasury money market funds.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P35_S2	The Company s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with maturities exceeding three months but less than one year.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P35_S3	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P35_S4	The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to five years, using the straight-line method.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the life of the related asset, whichever is shorter.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company s long-lived assets and other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P40_S2	Through December 31, 2015, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	Expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P41_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P41_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P41_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies are generally accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on the Company s behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	The majority of service providers invoice at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P42_S2	The Company periodically confirms the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and makes adjustments if necessary.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P42_S3	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	Clinical study expenses are further separated into two main categories: clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with manufacturing campaign, product formulation and chemical analysis.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company charges research and development costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	Clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	All of the Company s clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P46_S3	The Company accrues costs for clinical studies performed by CROs based on patient enrollment activities and adjusts the estimates, if required, based upon the Company s ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P46_S4	The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the CROs, and adjusts the estimates, if required, on a monthly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended by each CRO.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	All material CRO contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and the Company is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain noncancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Comprehensive loss consists of certain changes in equity that are excluded from net loss.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Specifically, the Company includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities in other comprehensive loss.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	Comprehensive loss for each period presented is set forth in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company operates in only one segment.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company s long-lived tangible assets consisted of mainly machinery purchased by the Company and installed by its contract manufacturing vendor, Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices, in the United Kingdom.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	The machinery is used for all of the Company s blisibimod product manufacturing campaigns.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	The computation of diluted Earnings Per Share, or EPS, is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Diluted EPS is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s calculation of net loss per common share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	As the Company incurred net losses for all of the periods presented, the following outstanding potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the effect of including them would have been antidilutive:
1316175_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, and rights to purchase shares under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and recognizes the costs in its consolidated financial statements over the employees requisite service period.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	Additionally, the Company is required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Expected Term The Company s expected term represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method, which is computed as the arithmetic mean of weighted vested period and contractual life.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Expected Volatility Expected volatility is estimated using comparable public company volatility for instruments with similar terms.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has never paid dividends and has no plans to pay dividends.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing method is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	The estimated forfeiture rate is determined based on the Company s historical forfeiture rates to date.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company monitors actual forfeitures and periodically updates the estimate.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and recognized as expense over the related service period.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	In September 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 , Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	ASU 2014-15 defines when and how companies are required to disclose going concern uncertainties, which must be evaluated each interim and annual period.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	Specifically, the ASU requires management to determine whether substantial doubt exists regarding the entity s going concern presumption.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	Substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indication that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become within one year after the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	If substantial doubt exists, certain disclosures are required; the extent of those disclosures depends on an evaluation of management s plans (if any) to mitigate the going concern uncertainty.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within that fiscal year.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P65_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to materially affect its consolidated financial statements .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance on the classification of deferred taxes, Accounting Standards Update No. 20154-17 ( ASU 2015-17 ), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	ASU 2015-17 eliminates the guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes , that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	The amendments require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single amount in a classified balance sheet.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P66_S3	The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P66_S4	Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of any interim period or annual reporting period.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P66_S5	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to materially affect its consolidated financial statements.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	ASU 2016-02 impacts any entity that enters into a lease with some specified scope exceptions.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	The guidance updates and supersedes Topic 840, Leases.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods with those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	We have not evaluated the impact of this guidance, but do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	In March 2015, the Company received a research award of up to $3 million from the CFFT for the Company's development of liprotamase.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	The Company retains the right to develop and commercialize liprotamase and will owe royalties to CFFT on net sales of any drug candidate approved and commercialized under the collaboration.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P69_S2	The funding is to be disbursed by CFFT to the Company upon the Company s achievement of milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P69_S3	At its discretion, the Company may choose to fund a particular stage of the liprotamase development plan without CFFT funds.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P69_S4	Any CFFT funds not expended on the development program of liprotamase must be returned to CFFT and, upon such return, the amounts of such returned funds will not be included as part of the research award for the purpose of calculating royalties or other amounts owed by the Company to CFFT.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	To the extent CFFT provides or makes available any information, expertise, know-how or other intellectual property related to cystic fibrosis or the treatment, prevention or cure there-of ( CFFT Know-How ) to the Company, CFFT grants to the Company a non-exclusive, transferrable, sublicensable, worldwide rights and license under all of CFFT s rights in such CFFT Know-How to assist the Company to research, develop, commercialize, make or have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import, export and otherwise exploit the product.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	In consideration for CFFT s research award and any licenses of intellectual property granted by CFFT, the Company agrees to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to five times the actual award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized $2.6 million of research award from CFFT in connection with achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	As of December 31, 2015, there was $0.4 million available under the research award.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P73_S2	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P73_S3	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
1316175_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and readily accessible by us at the reporting date.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there are little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	The following tables present the Company s fair value hierarchy for all its financial assets (including those in cash and cash equivalents), in thousands, by major security type measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	Property and equipment are comprised of the following (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company recorded $285,000, $344,000, and $353,000 respectively, in depreciation and amortization expense.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	In December 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Zenyaku ( Zenyaku Agreement ) for the development and commercialization of blisibimod in Japan and potentially other countries throughout Asia, while the Company retained full development and commercialization rights of blisibimod for all other global territories including North America and the European Union.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	Under the terms of the Zenyaku Agreement, the Company had the right to receive an upfront and forgivable loan of $7.0 million, milestone payments of up to $22.0 million contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, and up to $15.0 million in sales of the Company s common stock at a purchase price equal to 1.3 times the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock for 20 trading days prior to the delivery of the closing notice (the Premium Purchase Price ).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	Not all the conditions required to secure the forgivable loan were met and therefore, the Company had not exercised its right to receive the loan from Zenyaku.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P82_S2	During 2015, the Company had exercised its right with respect to $11.0 million of the $15.0 million in equity puts to Zenyaku, of which $9.0 million was received through the issuance of 2,946,810 shares of common stock and the Company does not expect to receive the remaining $2.0 million.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Under the terms of the Zenyaku Agreement, Zenyaku was responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs in Japan and would reimburse Anthera for i) 100% of blisibimod development cost in Japan for IgA nephropathy; ii) 25% of global blisibimod development cost outside of Japan for IgA nephropathy; iii) a percentage of Anthera s personnel costs at a pre-determined full-time equivalent ( FTE ) rate and iv) exclusive purchase of blisibimod clinical drug supplies at cost and blisibimod commercial drug products from the Company at a premium to the Company s manufacturing cost .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided the Company a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016 ( Termination Notice ).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	The termination was at will and the Termination Notice alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by the Company.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P84_S2	There were no termination penalties incurred by the Company in connection with the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement by Zenyaku.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P84_S3	No patients had been enrolled in any blisibimod clinical studies in the Zenyaku territory and Zenyaku.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P84_S4	The Company regained global rights of blisibimod on January 7, 2016.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	As a result of the Termination Notice received from Zenyaku in September 2015, the Company changed the amortization period of its deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period beginning in September 2015 when the Company received the termination notice from Zenyaku.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	The effect of this change in estimate was a $2.0 million increase license revenue and $0.05 decrease in net loss per share as a result of accelerating the amortization of deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P85_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded revenue of $3.2 million, which was comprised of $2.6 million for the amortization of the license fee revenue and $0.6 million for the reimbursement of FTEs, respectively.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P85_S3	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $1.5 million as reduction to research and development expenses in connection with the reimbursement of qualifying costs under the collaboration agreement .
1316175_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company leases its main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The lease is for approximately 14,000 square feet and the lease agreement will expire in September 2017.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P86_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized $222,000, $244,000 and $215,000, respectively, in rental expense.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	As of December 31, 2015, future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	In December 2007, the Company and Amgen entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement (the Amgen Agreement ) to develop and commercialize blisibimod in any indication, including for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company paid a nonrefundable, upfront license fee of $6.0 million.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P88_S2	As there was no future alternative use for the technology, the Company expensed the license fee in research and development expenses during 2007.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P88_S3	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company is obligated to make additional milestone payments to Amgen of up to $33.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P88_S4	The Company is also obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the high single digits to the low double digits, which are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P88_S5	The Company s royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	In connection with the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement, the Company amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of the collaboration between Anthera and Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by Anthera to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	Under this amendment, Anthera also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of its common stock equal $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P89_S2	The Company issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015, pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P89_S3	The Company accrued $1.0 million of license fees as research and development expense with a corresponding current liability in the year ended December 31, 2014.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	On July 11, 2014, the Company and Eli Lilly and Company ( Eli Lilly ) entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement (the Lilly Agreement ), to develop and commercialize liprotamase, a Phase 3 novel investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ), for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency, or EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, the Company was not required to make any up-front payment but is obligated to make milestone payments of up to up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P90_S2	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, the Company is obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens, that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P90_S3	The Company s royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	Based on the requirements of Form S-3, however, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in the Company s common stock and stock price, which may limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through LPC Purchase Agreement and registration statements described above.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P100_S7	In addition, in the case of certain large stockholders, the minimum exercise price of incentive options must equal 110% of fair market value on the date of grant and the maximum term is limited to five years.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P100_S8	Subject to overall Plan limitations, the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued in the form of incentive options shall not exceed 6,250,000 shares of common stock.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value stock options are as follows:
1316175_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	The intrinsic value of stock options represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options and the market price of our stock on that day for all in-the-money options.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Information about stock options outstanding, vested and exercisable as of December 31, 2015, was as follows:

1316175_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	Effective July 2010, under the terms of the ESPP, eligible employees of the Company may authorize the Company to deduct amounts from their compensation, which amounts are used to enable the employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P109_S1	The Company initially reserved 12,500 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder plus on January 1, 2011 and each January 1 thereafter, the number of shares of stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) 31,250 shares of common stock.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	Under the ESPP, eligible employees of the Company may authorize the Company to deduct amounts from their compensation, which amounts are used to enable the employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	The purchase price per share is 85% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the first date or the ending date of the applicable semi-annual purchase period, whichever is less (the Look-Back Provision ).
1316175_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	The 15% discount and the Look-Back Provision make the ESPP compensatory.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to value the employee stock purchase rights.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the following weighted-average assumptions were used in the valuation of the stock purchase rights:
1316175_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense, including expense recorded for the ESPP, was as follows (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan, or the 401(k) Plan.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P113_S1	Employee contributions are voluntary and are determined on an individual basis, limited by the maximum amounts allowable under federal tax regulations.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P113_S2	Prior to 2011, the Company had not made any contributions to the 401(k) Plan.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P113_S3	In December 2012, the Company amended its 401(k) plan to provide for non-elective employer contribution at the Company s discretion.

1316175_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company has incurred net operating losses since inception.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Company has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	The significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 2015, 2014, and 2013 is as follows:
1316175_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Tax benefits of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carryforwards are recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is more likely than not.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P118_S2	Because of the Company s history of operating losses, management believes that the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits are currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P118_S3	The net valuation allowance increased by $14.3 million in 2015, $11.7 million in 2014, and $11.9 million in 2013.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	The amount of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with excess tax deductions from stock-based compensation arrangements that would be allocated to contributed capital if the future tax benefits are subsequently recognized is $1.5 million.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	Net operating losses and tax return credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide for annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss and research and experimentation credit carryforwards if the Company were to undergo an ownership change, as defined in Section 382.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	In general, an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by 5-percent shareholders, as defined in Section 382, increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such 5-percent shareholders at any time over the preceding three years.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	The Company underwent an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 and 383 during 2012 and as such, the Company s net operating loss carryforwards are limited.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P123_S2	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P123_S3	As a result of the Section 382 limitation, $144.9 million of the Company s net operating losses and $11.5 million of R D credits have been written off.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P123_S4	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had federal net operating losses of $70.8 million that are subject to an annual limitation of $4.8 million through 2016 and decreases to $1.1 million thereafter.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P123_S5	Any unused annual limitation balance is available for carryforward to subsequent years for utilization.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P123_S6	The federal and state R D credits reported are not subject to limitation.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Since the Company s last ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 and 383, which occurred in 2012, the Company has increased its outstanding shares of common stock from 19,415,901 as of December 31, 2012 to 40,004,034 as of December 31, 2015, which may have resulted in a further ownership change.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	Accordingly, the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards which existed at that time could be limited.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P124_S2	The Company has not completed a Section 382 analysis to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since the Company became a loss corporation under the Code.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P124_S3	The Company has and will continue to evaluate alternative analyses permitted under Section 382 and IRS notices to determine whether or not any ownership changes have occurred and may occur (and if so, when they occurred) that would result in limitations on its net operating losses ( NOLs ) or certain other tax attributes.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1.3 million, all of which would not currently affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company s deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P125_S1	The Company did not anticipate any significant change to the unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P125_S2	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
1316175_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	The Company would classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, if applicable.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P126_S1	There was no interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through December 31, 2015.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P126_S2	The tax years 2004 through 2014 remain open to examination by one or more major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1316175_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized net tax benefits will significantly change prior to the end of 2016.

1316175_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	We currently have two product candidates, Sollpura, formally known as liprotamase, and blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	We licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Sollpura TM is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), or lupus, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	* Continued access study provided to patients who previously completed the SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	We plan to modifiy the study to allow patients completing future studies (e.g., RESULT or SIMPLICITY Part B) to have continued access and continue the EASY study until the Biologic License Application ( BLA ) for Sollpura is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	The exocrine pancreas is responsible for synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, including lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	In addition, the pancreas secretes bicarbonate into the duodenum to neutralize the very high acidity of stomach contents.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	EPI occurs when diseases such as CF and chronic pancreatitis impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	A reduction in, or absence of the normally secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes, causes lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to enter the distal gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract in un-absorbable forms, leading to GI pain and distention, mal-digestion, and steatorrhea.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Without appropriate therapy, patients with EPI may experience malnutrition, poor growth or weight loss, reduced quality of life, and, in severe cases, increased morbidity and early death.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	PERT is currently the mainstay of treatment for nutrient malabsorption in patients with digestive enzyme deficiencies known as EPI and orally delivered porcine PERTs have been available for many years for its treatment.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	As the porcine-derived proteins contained in the PERTs pass through the low pH environment of the stomach, they are protected by the enteric coating until they reach a pH of approximately 5.6 or greater in the duodenum and then are rapidly released.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Patient-to-patient differences in the acidity of the upper intestine makes dissolution of enterically-coated products variable, and gives rise to alterations in the rate and extent to which enzymes are released from these products.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Poor stability and variability in terms of potency and pharmaceutical properties have also been identified as important factors contributing to a poor response of some patients to PERTs.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Sollpura is a novel non-porcine PERT that contains three biotechnology-derived digestive enzymes: a lipase, a protease and an amylase.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Through enzyme cross-linking, the lipase enzyme in Sollpura is more stable than the porcine derived lipase in the low pH environment of the stomach and therefore Sollpura does not have an enteric polymer coating.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	Furthermore, since the three enzymes in Sollpura are biotechnology-derived, Sollpura does not contain porcine proteins or purines that may be associated with a risk of viral transmission or allergic reaction to proteins of porcine origin.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	The individual enzyme components of Sollpura are formulated at a fixed ratio of lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	The Sollpura enzyme dose ratio was selected from preclinical efficacy studies conducted using a canine model of pancreatic insufficiency which demonstrated that the lipase enzyme in Sollpura was efficacious when administered at 500 units/kg per meal, and the protease doses 1000 units/kg per meal.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	This finding is further supported by the similar efficacy observed between Sollpura and Creon in pigs with surgically-induced pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe Sollpura is potentially the first soluble, stable and non-porcine derived enzyme product to offer a novel solution to patients who are unable to maintain appropriate nutritional health.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Sollpura s chemical characteristics, unlike currently available PERTs, make it ideal for powder formulation as either a capsule, or sachet of powder for oral solution which can be conveniently administered in solution in a small volume of water.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We initiated the Phase 3 SOLUTION study in the third quarter of 2015.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	SOLUTION is a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sollpura in patients with cystic fibrosis-related exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	This pivotal study enrolled 128 patients in North America, Europe and Israel to evaluate the non-inferiority of Sollpura compared with another commercially available PERT in a population of porcine-derived PERT responders.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	Topline data announced in December 2016 showed that the study narrowly missed the Coefficient of Fat Absorption ( CFA ) non-inferiority margin of the primary modified Intent to Treat population (mITT) analysis by 1%; however, by additional pre-specified analyses of CFA (mITT-Baseline Observation Carried Forward and Per Protocol), Sollpura met the non-inferiority criterion.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S4	The study also confirmed that the ratio of the three enzymes in Sollpura demonstrated an appropriate response in the Coefficient of Nitrogen Absorption (CNA).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S5	CNA is a measure of protein digestion and absorption and is a key requirement of our planned United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulatory submission.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S6	Data from the SOLUTION study identified that, for some patients, higher doses may be necessary to compensate for the lower solubility of Sollpura under the acidic upper small intestinal conditions found in many patients with EPI due to CF.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P14_S7	We expect to release data from the extension phase of the study towards the end of first quarter of 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Because the SOLUTION study failed to achieve its primary endpoint by only one 1%, we plan to initiate a new Phase 3 study, informed by the SOLUTION study data, which we refer to as the RESULT study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	The RESULT study is expected to commence in the first half of 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	Similar to the SOLUTION study, the RESULT study will also be a randomized, open-label, assessor- blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	Approximately 150 cystic fibrosis patients who are porcine PERT responders will be enrolled in similar geographies as the SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	Based on data from the SOLUTION study, the planned RESULT study s design is being modified to (1) start Sollpura dosing as 125% of the pre-study PERT dose, and (2) allow for a more liberal dose titration, as needed, based on signs and symptoms throughout the primary treatment phase of the study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	We believe that efficacy in the SOLUTION study was limited by a restrictive dose optimization paradigm in a population whose dose of lipase at baseline had been optimized for porcine PERTs (but not Sollpura) and that modification of the dosing paradigm may allow for success in the RESULT study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P15_S6	Topline data from the RESULT study is expected towards the end of 2017 or in early 2018.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	A second, smaller Phase 3 study, SIMPLICITY, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	The SIMPLICITY study utilizes sachets containing Sollpura powder for oral solution.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	We expect to enroll approximately 46 patients in the two parts of the study (Part A and Part B).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Part A of the SIMPLICITY study, which evaluated the safety and general usability of the Sollpura powder for oral solution in 15 patients aged 7 years or older, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	An independent Data Monitoring Committee (the DMC ) evaluated the data from Part A and in its determination that it is safe to proceed with enrolling pediatric subjects less than 7 years of age in Part B of the study, unanimously approved the initiation of Part B of the study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Based on the data produced by the SOLUTION study, we plan to amend the SIMPLICITY study to follow similar dosing paradigm as the RESULT study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Part B of SIMPLICITY study will commence enrollment towards the middle of 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	We expect to fully enroll the SIMPLICITY study and to report topline data around the end of 2017 or the early 2018 depending upon study initiation timeline.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	During the third quarter of 2016, we initiated the EASY study, which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients who completed the SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	The EASY study will also be offered to patients completing RESULT and SIMPLICITY studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	We currently plan to continue the EASY study until the BLA for Sollpura is approved by the FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	We believe our Sollpura studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed porcine-derived PERTs, including:
1316175_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	A product that is wholly non-porcine.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	a capsule formulation using known, safe, excipients that provides lower pill burden and good delivery performance.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	a sachet formulation containing Sollpura power for oral solution which can be easily dissolved into water, and finally provides patients, especially young pediatric patients, with an easy-to-swallow dosing option.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	BAFF, or B-cell Activating Factor (also known as B lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS), is a member of a tumor necrosis family of natural human proteins and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell lineages as well as plasma cells all of which are critical to the human immune response.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and other dangerous antigens.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	Abnormally high elevations of BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including lupus and IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	According to the National Organization of Rare Disease, IgA nephropathy, an orphan indication, is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually in the United States.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	In Asia, a higher reported prevalence is attributed to the routine urinalyses that are often performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for any patients with asymptomatic hematuria.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	IgA nephropathy may occur when plasma B-cells express excessive amounts of abnormal IgA and subsequent immune complexes containing this immunogenic protein are deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	These IgA containing immune complexes deposit in the mesangium of glomeruli in the kidney and are proinflammatory.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	As a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	According to a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (Wyatt Julian, 2013), primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	In patients with IgA nephropathy, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy individuals, and elevated levels of BAFF are associated with histological severity of disease in kidney tissue.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	In IgA nephropathy, increased plasma B-cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	Significant reductions in plasma B-cells were observed in previous clinical studies of patients with lupus with another BAFF inhibitor antibody, belimumab.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	In our PEARL-SC Phase 2b study and our CHABLIS-SC1 Phase 3 study, significant reductions in total B-cells as well as significant improvements in proteinuria and increases in complement C3 were observed with blisibimod in lupus patients.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce proliferative B-cells and plasma B-cells, reduce serum levels of IgA and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	In June 2013, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study, BRIGHT-SC study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	The BRIGHT-SC study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	Enrollment criteria are biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Patients must be receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The BRIGHT-SC clinical study has enrolled patients in Southeast Asia, the European Union ( EU ) and Eastern Europe.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	In March 2015, an interim futility analysis of BRIGHT-SC study was conducted by an independent unblinded statistician, who evaluated several important biomarkers of renal disease in patients who had completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	In December 2016, an additional interim analysis of the BRIGHT-SC study was reported.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	This analysis, which was conducted when the last subject enrolled had completed the Week 48 assessments, confirmed and extended the observations from the analysis in June 2016 with more subjects contributing to the later timepoint in the analysis.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Of the original 57 patients enrolled into the study, 44 had a Week 48 observation and 22 patients had a Week 96 observation at the time of this analysis.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	As with the analysis in June 2016, the numerical reduction in proteinuria in blisibimod versus placebo treated patients at Week 48 did not meet the predefined statistical primary endpoint of complete or partial response.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	However, a tendency toward slowing proteinuria progression was again observed with blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	In contrast, over the same period the mean PCR worsened by almost 1.5 g/g in subjects randomized to placebo.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S6	Concomitant decreases were observed in B cells and immunoglobulins with blisibimod compared with placebo which supports the hypothesized mechanism of action that blisibimod-mediated BAFF inhibition acts to reduce peripheral B cells and immunoglobulins, and may prevent deterioration of PCR levels in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P41_S7	Given the positive effect observed in this analysis, Anthera plans to continue to follow the subjects enrolled in the BRIGHT study to gain more understanding of the long-term effects of blisibimod on disease progression.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Effects of Blisibimod on Proteinuria in Subjects with IgA Nephropathy in the BRIGHT-SC Study:
1316175_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	According to our estimate, EPI is a disease that affects an estimated 130,000 patients in the United States.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	The most common causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, the former a longstanding inflammation of the pancreas altering the organ's normal structure and function that can result from malnutrition, heredity, or (in the western world especially), behavior (alcohol use and smoking), and the latter a recessive hereditary disease most common in Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews where the molecular culprit is an altered, CFTR-encoded chloride channel.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	In children, another common cause is Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the SBDS gene.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a human antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity, which provides protection to an organism s various mucous membranes from invasion by infections.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	IgA nephropathy (also known as IgA nephritis or Berger's disease) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidney) throughout the world and a principal cause of end-stage renal disease.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	The prevalence of IgA nephropathy varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan and China), Australia, Finland and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulonephritis).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein, especially aberrant and immunogenic forms of IgA, are recognized by other immunoglobulins, forming proinflammatory immune complexes which are deposited in the kidney.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	As a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	The classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection or (less commonly) gastrointestinal or urinary infection.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	In the United States, IgA nephropathy is considered an orphan disease as it is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for patients with asymptomatic hematuria and the reported prevalence of the disease is much higher.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	For example, in Japan, IgA nephropathy is estimated to affect over 350,000 people annually.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Technology transfer to commercial scale active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing and drug product manufacturing CMOs was initiated in 2015 and completed in late 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	The large scale fermentation and the associated down-stream process validation activities for all three enzyme APIs are anticipated to be complete in late 2017 to early 2018.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	In parallel, commercial scale capsule and sachet drug product manufacturing process validation is anticipated to be completed in late 2017 to early 2018.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	In December 2011, we completed the manufacturing site transfer from Amgen to our contract manufacturing organization ( CMO ), Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices ( Fujifilm ).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	We also scaled up manufacturing from 300 liters up to 3,000 liters.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	Three batches of blisibimod produced under U.S. and EU good manufacturing procedures ( GMPs ), at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	In 2013, our licensor, Eli Lilly, gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a Phase 3 clinical study (SOLUTION) that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of Sollpura to respond to the FDA s 2011 complete response letter.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	We completed the SOLUTION study and reported topline data in December 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	The SOLUTION study narrowly missed the primary endpoint by one percent.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	As a result of the narrow miss we intend to initiate a new Phase 3 study, RESULT, incorporating the learnings from the SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P54_S4	The RESULT study should also address the 2005 EMA protocol assistance comments, which were consistent with the FDA s request for an active comparator trial.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	In September 2013, we met with the FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as an endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	In this meeting we gained the PMDA s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan and have amended the BRIGHT-SC study to include the specific data requirements of the PMDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	We reached an agreement with the EMA on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable as well as the requirement for a single study to support a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application ( CMAA ) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study, would be available post approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P55_S5	The EMA also recommended the protocol to provide information on the required duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P55_S6	Data generated from the analyses of the BRIGHT-SC study at week 24 and 48 will be used to guide the final study design elements for the Phase 3 registration study protocol.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	We continue to dose patients in our Phase 2 BRIGHT-SC clinical study for the treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy, an orphan disease.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	As a result of the proteinuria effect after 48 weeks of dosing, and the demonstration of blisibimod s effect on immunological markers relevant to IgA nephropathy including reductions of B cells, and immunoglobulins including IgA, IgG and IgM, we plan to continue the study until the majority of subjects have had the opportunity to complete two years of treatment.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	Based on our previous discussions with regulatory authorities, we believe an evaluation of the change in proteinuria could serve as a surrogate endpoint to support an accelerated or conditional approval in various key commercial geographies.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	In December 2016, we submitted an orphan designation request to the US FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P56_S4	The FDA agreed that IgAN meets the regulatory definition of a serious condition.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P56_S5	Following the completion of the BRIGHT-SC study we intend to explore a Special Protocol Assessment from the US FDA to ensure final concurrence on the willingness to consider proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint, the timing for completion of enrollment of the post marketing confirmatory study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Sollpura was studied from 2002 to 2009 in seven clinical trials, in which a total of 492 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	Three Phase 1 trials were conducted, 1 in healthy volunteers and 2 in subjects with EPI due to CF.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	Two short-term trials, the Phase 2 Study TC-2A, and the Phase 3 Study 726 evaluated the efficacy of Sollpura in subjects 7 years of age with EPI due to CF.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	Two long-term Phase 3 safety and tolerability trials were also conducted: Study 767 in subjects with EPI due to CF and Study 810 in subjects with EPI due to chronic pancreatitis/pancreatectomy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	Completed clinical trials demonstrated that dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) absorption are significantly increased in patients with cystic fibrosis and EPI who received Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	In 2013, Eli Lilly gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a pivotal trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	The dose-ranging Phase 1 study TC-1B evaluated five dose levels across a 50-fold range, from 100-to-5000 lipase units (U) per kg per meal in CF-EPI subjects.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	In this study, greater improvements in nutrients absorption, as measured using the percent change from baseline in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA), were observed at doses of 500 lipase U per kg per meal and higher.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Study TC-2A, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-finding trial, was conducted in 125 pediatric and adult subjects with CF-related EPI who were treated with Sollpura in one of three dosing regimens containing 6,500 U, 32,500 U, and 130,000 U lipase administered per meal or snack.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	Observed mean CFAs at the end of study were 56.2%, 67.0%, and 69.7% in the 6,500, 32,500, and 130,000 U dose groups, respectively (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0032) with significant improvements in mean changes from baseline (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0005).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	Pairwise comparison of the CFA values showed that statistically greater improvements were observed at the higher doses of Sollpura compared with the lowest dose of 6,500 U. Similar improvements in the CNA, were observed with Sollpura at the two highest dose levels.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Study 726, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, parallel design, multinational clinical, evaluated the effects of a single capsule of Sollpura (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) or placebo administered with every meal or snack in subjects with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Among the 138 subjects enrolled in this study, treatment with Sollpura resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in the CFA of 21.2% with Sollpura compared with 6.0% with placebo (p = 0.0011).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	The median body weight of subjects in this trial was 50 kg, for which the corresponding Sollpura dose was 650 U lipase/kg/meal or snack.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Two one-year studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and effects on nutritional status of Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	Study 810 evaluated adult subjects with EPI due to CP or after pancreatectomy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	Among the 214 subjects who were treated, an average dose of 5.5 capsules (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) of Sollpura per day maintained nutritional status as assessed by serial measurement of height and weight, including age-appropriate growth and weight gain in children.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P62_S3	Mean BMI z-scores for subjects in Study 767 were maintained over time on study (mean BMI z-score at baseline, Months 3, 6, and 12 were -0.503,-0.637, -0.688, and -0.655, respectively).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	To date, five randomized, clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two Phase 1 dose-ranging studies by our licensor, Amgen, two double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical outcomes studies, PEARL-SC (Phase 2b) and CHABLIS-SC1 (Phase 3), and a Phase 2 Open-Label Extension study (OLE).
1316175_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	All five clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	The PEARL-SC study was completed in June 2012 and the CHABLIS-SC1 study was completed in November 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	Both studies failed to meet the primary endpoints and we elected to stop further development of blisibimod for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	In the CHABLIS-SC1 study, the primary endpoint compared the effects of blisibimod and placebo at Week 52 using the SLE Responder Index-6 (SRI-6): 6-point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, no new BILAG 1A or 2B domain scores, and 0.3-point increase in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	Compared with placebo, a higher proportion of subjects on blisibimod met the SRI-6 criteria from Week 16 through Week 52.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	However, this effect was not statistically significant at the primary endpoint analysis at Week 52.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	Significant changes in SLE-relevant disease markers were observed with blisibimod, including reductions in urinary protein:creatinine ratio, peripheral B cell lineages, anti-dsDNA, anti-phospholipid antibodies, and serum immunoglobulins, and significant increases in complement C3 and C4.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P64_S4	We believe the latter effects support the ongoing research with blisibimod into IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P64_S5	As a result of the outcomes of the CHABLIS-SC1 trial, at the end of 2016, we elected to discontinue the Phase 3 CHABLIS-7.5 study, which was initiated in June 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	Since our inception in 2004, we have focused primarily on developing our product candidates, which currently include Sollpura and blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	We currently focus our clinical development and research efforts on Sollpura, as an enzyme replacement therapy for EPI, and blisibimod, which is being developed for a renal disease, IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $46.5 million, $33.6 million and $21.8 million, respectively, of research and development expense.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including enzyme replacement therapies and renal disease.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	We are advancing the development of Sollpura in a Phase 3 registration program in patients with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	We are also advancing the development of blisibimod to evaluate the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of Sollpura and blisibimod, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our product candidates are focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as cystic fibrosis specialists and nephrologists.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	Our primary competitors are described in further detail below, under Approved Categories of Drugs .
1316175_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P70_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P70_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P70_S4	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis, including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pertzye by Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc., and Ultresa and Zenpep by Aptalis Pharma US.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	Alcresta recently gained marketing approval for its product, Relizorb, which utilizes a digestive lipase enzyme, and is designed for use by adults on enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing dietary fats.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	We are aware of one company with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH Co. KG s compound, Burlulipase (also known as NM-BL), recently completed a Phase 1/Phase 2 study in patients with EPI.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	As of the date of this report, our Sollpura portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly, including:
1316175_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	Three pending non-EP foreign patent application.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Eli Lilly to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in March 2025 and July 2028.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of Sollpura, one of these U.S. patents may be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S3	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S4	This could extend the expiration date of the selected U.S. Patent to as late as March 2030 or July 2033, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S5	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S6	The three exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire between February 2021 and October 2025.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P78_S7	One of these patents may be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to between February 2026 and October 2030.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	As of the date of this report, our blisibimod patent portfolio includes:
1316175_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	Four pending non-EP foreign patent applications in Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Poland.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Amgen to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	In addition, we hold a non-exclusive worldwide license to one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, one pending EP patent application, and over 50 non-EP foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to general peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	The four exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022, March 2023 and November 2023.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P83_S2	This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to as late as May 2027, March 2028 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P83_S3	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P83_S4	The exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P83_S5	One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P84_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P84_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	We are aware of two third-party issued U.S. patents that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P87_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of either of these issued U.S. patents in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P87_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P87_S4	If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and possibly requiring us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P87_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009 and November 2014 (as amended, the Amgen Agreement ), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	Under the Amgen Agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing blisibimod, as well as the right to grant sublicenses.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P89_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P89_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than blisibimod that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Agreement, we have paid $6.0 million in license fees to Amgen for blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States, European Union or Japan.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P91_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P91_S4	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	In connection with a collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku for the development of IgA nephropathy that was executed in December 2014 and terminated in January 2016, we amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of our collaboration with Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by us to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	Under this amendment, we also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of our common stock equal to $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P93_S2	We issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015 pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	On July 11, 2014, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly (the Lilly Agreement ), to develop and commercialize Sollpura, a Phase 3 novel investigational PERT for the treatment of patients with EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we were not required to make any up-front payment but we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2015.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P94_S3	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	On December 11, 2014, we entered into the Zenyaku Agreement with Zenyaku, pursuant to which we granted Zenyaku an exclusive license to certain patent rights, know-how and other intellectual property relating to blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P95_S2	The termination was at will and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P95_S3	We did not incur any termination penalties in connection with the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement by Zenyaku.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P95_S4	As of the date of termination, no patients had been enrolled in any blisibimod clinical studies in the Zenyaku territory and Zenyaku had not purchased any blisibimod product from us.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P95_S5	As a result of the termination on January 7, 2016, we regained full worldwide rights for blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current GMP with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce product candidates provide us with faulty products or such products are later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	Our contract manufacturers obtain the raw materials for the drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies from a variety of sources.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	We believe that this will provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials and drug product to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical systems, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P98_S2	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by local, state and federal regulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P99_S2	In order to commercialize our product candidates, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P99_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidates alone.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P99_S4	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in international markets.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidates to market.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P101_S1	Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either the new drug application, or NDA, process, or the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P101_S2	Both of our drug candidates, Sollpura and blisibimod, are biologically manufactured and will go through the BLA process for approval if successful in Phase 3.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P102_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P102_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S3	The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S4	Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S5	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S6	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P106_S7	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P107_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P107_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P107_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P107_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P107_S5	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P109_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P112_S1	Safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 days after the sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator s brochure.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P112_S2	A sponsor also must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 days after the sponsor s receipt of the information.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P112_S3	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P112_S4	The FDA, a data safety monitoring board, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P112_S5	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P113_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidates and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P113_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P115_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P115_S2	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P116_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P116_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P116_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P117_S1	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP- compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P117_S2	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P118_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P118_S1	The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P118_S2	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P118_S3	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P118_S4	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P119_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P119_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P119_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P119_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P119_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P119_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P119_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P120_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P120_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P120_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P121_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P121_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Act permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P121_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P121_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P121_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P121_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P121_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P122_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S6	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P123_S7	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P124_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P124_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P125_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P125_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P126_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P126_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P126_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P127_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P127_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P127_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if any of our product candidates is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P127_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P128_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P128_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P129_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P129_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P130_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P130_S1	Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P131_S0	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P131_S1	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P132_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P132_S1	A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P132_S2	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P132_S3	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P133_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well- controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P133_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P133_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P134_S0	The FDA Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA includes a provision that allows sponsors to request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P134_S1	The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P134_S2	The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable, (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P135_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record- keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P136_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P136_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P136_S2	Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P136_S3	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P137_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P137_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P137_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P138_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P138_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P139_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P139_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P140_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P140_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P140_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P141_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P142_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P142_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P143_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P143_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P143_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P143_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P144_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P144_S1	European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P145_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P145_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P145_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P146_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P146_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P146_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P146_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P146_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including, at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S3	However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S6	Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S7	It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P147_S8	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P148_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P148_S1	For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P148_S2	Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P148_S3	Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P148_S4	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P148_S5	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P148_S6	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P149_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P149_S1	Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P149_S2	Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P149_S3	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P149_S4	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P149_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P149_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P150_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P150_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P150_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P150_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P151_S0	There are also laws that govern a company s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P151_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company s ability to operate its business.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P152_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P152_S1	We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P152_S2	Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P152_S3	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P152_S4	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P152_S5	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P153_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P154_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P155_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P156_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P156_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P156_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P156_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P156_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P156_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P157_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we had 33 employees.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P157_S1	All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P157_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P158_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P158_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P158_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P159_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware in 2004.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P159_S1	The mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P160_S0	Through a link on the Investors section of our website (under SEC Filings in the Financial Information section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_17_ITEM1_P160_S1	Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with two assets in the clinical stage of development.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2004.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $407.6 million.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Substantially all of our losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We expect to incur additional losses over the next several years, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate revenues.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	As more fully discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, we believe there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we do not currently have sufficient cash resources to fund our operations through March 16, 2018, or one year from the filing date of the Form 10-K. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we are unable to continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose their entire investment .
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have never generated any product revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct clinical studies in patients, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	However, as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod, we began recognizing license fee revenue and collaborative revenue in 2015.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The license fee revenue from the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku was initially amortized as revenue over the performance obligation period (product development period) while reimbursement for our full time employees ( FTEs ) was recorded as collaborative revenues as incurred.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The termination was at will and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	As a result of an early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement, we do not expect to recognize revenues under the Zenyaku Agreement beyond January 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our product candidates have failed in clinical studies because we were unable to demonstrate that they were effective.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Furthermore, our products candidates could fail if they cause unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Failure of our product candidates in clinical studies will have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The amount of cash and other sources of capital available to us, including the net proceeds from our March 2017 offering, are not expected to be sufficient to fund our expected needs for the next twelve months, which results in substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph to the effect that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in its report included in its opinion to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	terminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for sale.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to our licensors is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In December 2007, we entered into the Amgen Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low teens as net sales increase.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In July 2014, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Pursuant to the Lilly Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives for any Sollpura formulation.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We are also required to make tiered royalty payments on net sales, which percentage increases from the high single digits to the mid-teens as net sales increase.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ( CFFT ) for the development of Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Under the research award agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the five times the award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to our licensors is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of our product candidates, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, conducting product development activities for our primary product candidates, Sollpura and blisibimod, and performing research and development.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our product candidates which are still under clinical development.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well- controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidates are safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until the U.S. FDA approves our biologics license applications, or BLAs, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We have not submitted any BLA or received marketing approval for our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the U.S. FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The U.S. FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	From time to time during the regulatory approval process of our product candidates, we engage in discussions with the U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may receive informal verbal and or written guidance from these authority agencies which may help form the basis of our clinical trial designs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory agencies may change their position on such informal guidance prior to the approval of our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	As a result, we are unable to determine whether the outcome of informal deliberations will become final.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with inquires and requests from the U.S. FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value maybe be reduced.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospect.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the U.S. FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Product development costs to us will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidates or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delays outside our control.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical development plans or clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for re- examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidates, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidates have performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain U.S. FDA approval for our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we breach the license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are party to the Amgen Agreement, which provides for the exclusive worldwide licenses of the compositions of matter and methods of use for blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive worldwide licenses of compositions of matter and methods of use relating to peptibodies generally.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We are also party to the Lilly Agreement, which provides for an exclusive worldwide license of the compositions of matter, formulation, and methods of use patents for Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	These agreements require us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify our licensors under the terms of the agreements.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors may terminate our licenses and may be able to re-obtain licensed technologies and aspects of any intellectual properties controlled by us that relate to the licensed technologies that originated from our licensors.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of the licensed product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreements.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents and patent applications licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the license agreements could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The market for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is also highly competitive.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis, including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pertzye by Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc., and Ultresa and Zenpep by Aptalis Pharma US.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We are also aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: Johnson and Johnson Research and Development LLC recently completed a Phase 3 study to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral pancrelipase MT in the treatment of adult and pediatric/adolescent cystic fibrosis patients with clinical symptoms of EPI; and Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH Co. KG s compound, Burlulipase, is being tested in a Phase 3 study in patients with EPI.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, and in obtaining U.S. FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining U.S. FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidates we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P44_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Blisibimod - the most common adverse effects seen with blisibimod versus placebo include injection site erythema and nasopharyngitis.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The most common serious adverse events seen with blisibimod include Herpes zoster, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis, intervertebral disc protrusion, spontaneous abortion, and kidney stones.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	During the placebo-controlled Phase 2 PEARL study, blisibimod was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels with no meaningful imbalances in serious adverse events or infections between blisibimod and placebo.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Discontinuation due to adverse event was lower among blisibimod-treated subjects (5.7%) compared to placebo (7.9%).
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Amongst the commonly-reported adverse events, imbalance was observed only with injection site reactions (200mg QW blisibimod = 15%, matched placebo = 7%), but these were not serious or severe and did not result in discontinuation of treatment.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Sollpura the most common adverse effects seen with Sollpura include general gastrointestinal disorder, such as abdominal pain, flatulence, loose stools and diarrhea.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our second product candidate, Sollpura, which we licensed from Eli Lilly in July 2014, received a complete response letter ( CRL ) from the U.S. FDA while it was under development by Eli Lilly in April 2011.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Eli Lilly has attempted to address the material items highlighted by the FDA in the CRL and worked directly with the U.S. FDA on a clinical development program for Sollpura which, if successful, could result in regulatory approval of Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	There are still open items from the CRL that we will need to address with the U.S. FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	While we plan to make reasonable efforts to accommodate and address the U.S. FDA s inquires and request, we are unable to determine the final outcome of the CRL.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Any delay in addressing the CRL to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA may result in postponement of our Phase 3 clinical trial of Sollpura in patients with EPI.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If serious adverse events that are considered related to our product candidates are observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Further, if our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidates and could substantially increase the costs of commercialization.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from the product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize any product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidate.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we develop.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in U.S. FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and U.S. FDA regulatory review.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the U.S. FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	For example, the label ultimately approved for blisibimod or Sollpura, if any, may include restrictions on use.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Further, the U.S. FDA has indicated that long-term safety data on blisibimod may need to be obtained as a post-market requirement.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing U.S. FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with our product candidates, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the products are manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the products, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the products from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P56_S6	If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from their sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The degree of market acceptance of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third- party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The use of product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P64_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	decreased demand for product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	If and when we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P69_S3	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P72_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P72_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P72_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P74_S2	If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates or market them.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P75_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the U.S. FDA to withdraw approvals previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce drug product for our clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	There are a small number of suppliers, and in some instances, a single supplier for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture drug product.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials and equipment to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P76_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials and equipment by our manufacturers.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P76_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P76_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of product candidates to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of product candidates or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P76_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained, the commercial launch would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of such product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	If we successfully commercialize a product candidate, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, which may not occur on a timely basis.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Some of our manufacturing suppliers are located overseas, and the transportation of drug supplies to or from these facilities to their intended destinations is subject to certain risks of loss and damage beyond our control.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Additionally, the importation of drug supplies into and from foreign countries is subject to customs regulations that may require us to incur additional regulatory costs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the U.S. FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P80_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	G uidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory requirements or reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	New federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P84_S1	New legislation and additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidates, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P88_S2	We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for any product we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Also in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P89_S3	As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P89_S4	These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third- party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, the Health Care Reform Law and additional prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P91_S4	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P91_S5	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the EU and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Craig Thompson, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. William R. Shanahan, our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Chuck Olson, our Chief Technology Officer, and Ms. Klara Dickinson-Eason, our Senior Vice President and Chief Regulatory Officer, and the other principal members of our executive team.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P95_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We are a target of this type of litigation.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P98_S2	cv-715, on behalf of a putative class of the Company s stockholders against the Company and certain of its current and former officers, as discussed in Item 3.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our common stock is currently at risk for delisting from NASDAQ.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market ( NASDAQ ).
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P100_S1	NASDAQ has minimum requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on NASDAQ.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P100_S2	These requirements include maintaining a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P100_S3	On February 10, 2017, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Global Stock Market informing us that for the last 30 consecutive business days the bid price of our common stock has closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P100_S4	The letter stated that Nasdaq will provide the Company a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until August 9, 2017, to regain compliance.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P100_S5	To regain compliance, any time before August 9, 2017, the bid price of our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	In addition, if delisted we would no longer be subject to NASDAQ rules, including rules requiring us to have a certain number of independent directors and to meet other corporate governance standards.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Our failure to be listed on NASDAQ or another established securities market would have a material adverse effect on the value of your investment in us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	If our common stock is not listed on NASDAQ or another national exchange, the trading price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share and we have net tangible assets of $6,000,000 or less, the open-market trading of our common stock will be subject to the penny stock rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P102_S1	If our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	obtain a signed and dated acknowledgement from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before a transaction in a penny stock can be completed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	As a result of these requirements, the market price of our securities may be adversely impacted, and current stockholders may find it more difficult to sell our securities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile, which could result in the decline of the value of your investment in our common stock or class action litigation against us and our management, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P108_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P108_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P108_S5	These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Securities litigation against us, including as discussed elsewhere in this form 10-K, could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention and resources and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Because a small number of our existing stockholders own a material amount of our voting stock, your ability to influence corporate matters will be limited.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 17.56% of our outstanding common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P111_S1	As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to influence our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P111_S2	These persons will also have the ability to influence our management and business affairs.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P111_S3	This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P113_S0	As of the date of this report, there were 45,964,286 shares of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P113_S1	On March 14, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with H.C. Wainwright, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell 30,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares of our common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P113_S2	Under the terms of the underwriter agreement, we granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase an additional 4,500,000 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 9,000,000 shares of common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P113_S3	In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase 8,294,438 shares of our common stock that, if exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P113_S4	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P113_S5	Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P113_S6	Moreover, certain holders of shares of common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We have registered or will register all common stock that we may issue under our 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan ), our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan ) and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P114_S1	As of December 31, 2016, an aggregate of 472,676 shares of our common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, plus any shares cancelled under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Plan, and an aggregate of 68,677 shares of common stock have been reserved for future issuance under our ESPP.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P114_S2	These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P114_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P115_S0	In addition, we may sell shares of stock pursuant a Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC ( H.C. Wainwright ) executed in April 2016 pursuant to an at-the-market equity program ( ATM ) under which we may from time to time offer and sell up to $25.0 million shares of our common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P115_S1	On March 14, 2017, we amended the H.C. Wainwright agreement and reduced the amount of securities to $23 million, of which $20.3 million remained available to be sold as of the date of this report.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We will need to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P117_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P118_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P120_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P120_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P120_S2	For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P120_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P121_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P121_S1	We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P121_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P122_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P123_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P123_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P123_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P126_S0	the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P127_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P127_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P129_S1	An ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P129_S2	We underwent an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 ownership of the Internal Revenue Code during 2012 and as such, our net operating loss carryforwards are limited.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P129_S3	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P129_S4	If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P130_S0	We may be unable to issue securities under our shelf registration statement, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P131_S0	We have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P131_S1	The registration statement is subject to Instruction I.B.6.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P131_S2	of Form S-3, which imposes a limitation on the maximum amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to the registration statement during any twelve-month period.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P131_S3	At the time we sell securities pursuant to the registration statement, the amount of securities to be sold plus the amount of any securities we have sold during the prior twelve months in reliance on Instruction I.B.6.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P131_S4	may not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days immediately preceding such sale, as computed in accordance with Instruction I.B.6.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P131_S5	Based on this calculation and as a result of this offering, we expect that we will be significantly limited, and likely unable, to sell additional securities pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-3 for a period of twelve months following the date of this offering, unless and until the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates increases significantly.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P131_S6	If we cannot sell securities under our shelf registration, we may be required to utilize more costly and time-consuming means of accessing the capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and cash position.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P132_S0	have the right to require the Company to redeem any or all of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock that is ineligible for conversion.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P133_S0	The Company is not required to issue any shares of common stock upon conversion of any shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock to the extent that (i) the aggregate issuance of common stock will be greater than 8,385,828 shares or 19.99% of the total outstanding shares of the Company and (ii) the conversion has not been approved by the Company s stockholders in accordance with the stockholder approval requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5635(d) (a Blocked Conversion ).
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P133_S1	In the event that a Blocked Conversion occurs after April 30, 2017, the holders of shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock who are not able to convert their Series X Convertible Preferred Stock in full because of the Blocked Conversion shall have the right to require the Company to redeem any or all of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock that is ineligible for conversion at a redemption price equal to the product of: (x) the number of their shares underlying the to-be-redeemed Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, multiplied by (y) the two-day volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock prior to the date of delivery of such notice of redemption.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Based on a conversion price of $1.9692 per share, the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock would convert into 8,632,947 shares of common stock, which exceeded the Threshold Amount by 247,119 shares of common stock or approximately 487 shares of Series X convertible preferred stock, which are subject to contingent redemption as of December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P133_S3	Such forced redemption would be an additional cost to the Company and may negative affect its stock price.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P134_S0	If our or our licensors patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidates or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P135_S0	We hold license rights to numerous U.S. European Patents ( EP ), and non-EP foreign patents and patent applications relating to blisibimod and Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P135_S1	Our Sollpura portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P135_S2	Our blisibimod portfolio is made up of exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen, Inc.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P136_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P137_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P138_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P139_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P140_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P141_S0	the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We are aware of two third-party issued United States patents that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P142_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P142_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of either of these issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P142_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P142_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P142_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P143_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P144_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P144_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P144_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P144_S3	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P144_S4	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P144_S5	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P144_S6	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P145_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P145_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P146_S0	We are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the novel BAFF inhibitor blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P146_S1	We are also a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Sollpura, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to Sollpura compositions and formulations.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P147_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering blisibimod and Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P147_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P147_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P147_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P147_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P147_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P147_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P148_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P148_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P148_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P148_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P149_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and to obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P150_S0	The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in the regulatory approval process.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P150_S1	Assuming we gain a five-year patent term extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2027 or 2028.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P151_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P151_S1	Assuming we gain such a five-year extension for blisibimod and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to blisibimod, we would have exclusive rights to blisibimod s European new chemical entity patents until 2027.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P151_S2	Further, since blisibimod has not been previously approved, blisibimod could be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity from the U.S. FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P151_S3	During the data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P152_S0	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small molecule compound or biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that compound or biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P152_S1	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P152_S2	However, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P152_S3	If we fail to receive such Hatch-Waxman extensions or marketing exclusivity rights or if we receive extensions that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P153_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P154_S0	We typically develop product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P154_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P154_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P155_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P155_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P156_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P156_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P156_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P156_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P157_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P157_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P159_S1	If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidates and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P160_S1	Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P160_S2	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P160_S3	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors existing or future patents.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P161_S0	Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P162_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P162_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P163_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P163_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_17_ITEM1A_P163_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We occupy approximately 14,000 square feet under a facility lease agreement that expires in September 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe our existing facility is adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	On February 13, 2017, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California captioned Brian Clevlen v. Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:17-cv-715, on behalf of a putative class of the Company s stockholders against the Company and certain of its current and former officers.
1316175_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaint asserts claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased the Company s common stock between February 10, 2015 and December 27, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements and/or omissions with respect to the CHABLIS-SC1 trial and SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM3_P0_S3	The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys fees, costs, and such other relief at the Court may deem just and proper.
1316175_17_ITEM3_P0_S4	The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations in the action.
1316175_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Other than as described above, we are not subject to any material pending legal proceedings.
1316175_17_ITEM3_P1_S1	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol ANTH since our initial public offering ( IPO ).
1316175_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to that offering, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Global Market:
1316175_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2016, an aggregate of 45,964,286 shares of our common stock and 9,499 shares of Series X convertible preferred stock were issued and outstanding and were held by 37 and 5 registered holders, respectively, based on information provided by the Company s transfer agent.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	A significantly larger number of stockholders may be "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P2_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III, Item 12 of this report.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	All information under this Item has been previously reported on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC.
1316175_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	We did not repurchase any securities during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables reflect selected consolidated summary financial data for each of the last five fiscal years and are derived from our audited financial statements.
1316175_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	This data should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from CFFT for our development of Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $0.3 million in research award from CFFT in connection with achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	The amount has been recognized as a component of Operating Expenses.
1316175_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	Weighted average shares used in net loss per basic and diluted share in 2012 have been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split effectuated by the Company on July 15, 2013.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We currently have two compounds in development, Sollpura and blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	We licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates, and since inception we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, debt financing, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a former collaborative partner, Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd ( Zenyaku ), and a research award from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT").
1316175_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	In addition to the normal risks associated with drug development companies, we may never successfully complete development of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	In December 2014, we entered in an exclusive license agreement with Zenyaku for the development and commercialization of blisibimod in Japan and potentially other countries throughout Asia.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	The termination was at will and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	There were no termination penalties incurred by us in connection with the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	We also regained full worldwide rights for blisibimod and we are actively pursuing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to further advance the development of blisibimod globally.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from CFFT for our development of Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	We retain the right to develop and commercialize Sollpura and will owe royalties to CFFT on net sales of any drug candidate approved and commercialized under the collaboration.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	The funding is to be disbursed by CFFT to us upon our achievement of milestones specified in the agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	At our discretion, we may choose to fund a particular stage of the Sollpura development plan without CFFT funds.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	Any CFFT funds not expended on the development program of Sollpura must be returned to CFFT and, upon such return, the amounts of such returned funds will not be included as part of the research award for the purpose of calculating royalties or other amounts owed by us to CFFT.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	To the extent CFFT provides or makes available any information, expertise, know-how or other intellectual property related to cystic fibrosis or the treatment, prevention or cure thereof ( CFFT Know-How ) to us, CFFT grants to us a non-exclusive, transferrable, sublicensable, worldwide rights and license under all of CFFT s rights in such CFFT Know-How to assist us to research, develop, commercialize, make or have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import, export and otherwise exploit the product.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	We initiated the Phase 3 SOLUTION study in the third quarter of 2015.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	SOLUTION was a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sollpura in patients with cystic fibrosis-related exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	This pivotal study enrolled 128 patients in North America, Europe and Israel is intended to evaluate the non-inferiority of Sollpura compared with another commercially available PERT in a population of porcine-derived PERT responders.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Topline data announced in December 2016 showed that the study narrowly missed the CFA non-inferiority margin of the primary modified Intent to Treat (mITT) analysis by one percent; however, by additional pre-specified analyses of CFA (mITT-Baseline Observation Carried Forward and Per Protocol), Sollpura met the non-inferiority criterion.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	The study also confirmed that the ratio of the three enzymes in Sollpura demonstrated an appropriate response in the coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA).
1316175_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	CNA is a measure of protein digestion and absorption and is a key requirement of our planned US FDA regulatory submission.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P12_S6	We expect to release data from the extension phase of the study in the first quarter of 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Due to the narrow miss of the SOLUTION study, we plan to initiate a new Phase 3 study (RESULT), informed by data produced from the SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The RESULT study is expected to commence in the first half of 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Similar to the SOLUTION study, the RESULT study is a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority, active-comparator study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Approximately 150 cystic fibrosis patients who are porcine PERT responders will be enrolled in the same geographies as the SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	Based on data from the SOLUTION study, the RESULT study s design is being modified to 1) start Sollpura dosing as 125% of the pre-study PERT dose, and 2) allow for a more liberal dose titration, as needed, based on signs and symptoms throughout the primary treatment phase of the study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	We believe that efficacy in the SOLUTION trial was limited by a restrictive dose optimization paradigm in a population whose dose of lipase at baseline had been optimized for porcine PERTs (but not Sollpura) and that modification of the dosing paradigm may allow for success in the RESULT study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	Topline data from the RESULT study is expected around the end of 2017 or early 2018.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	A second, smaller Phase 3 study, SIMPLICITY, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The SIMPLICITY study utilizes sachets containing Sollpura powder for oral solution.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	plan to enroll approximately 46 patients in two parts (Part A and Part B).
1316175_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	Part A which evaluated the safety and general usability of the Sollpura powder for oral solution in 15 patients 7 years of age was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	An independent Data Monitoring Committee evaluated the data from Part A and has determined that it is safe to proceed to enroll pediatric subjects below 7 years of age in Part B of the study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	Based on the learning from the SOLUTION study, we plans to amend the SIMPLICITY study to follow similar dosing approach as the RESULT study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P16_S4	Part B will commence enrollment towards the middle of 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P16_S5	We expect to fully enroll the SIMPLICITY study and report topline data around the end of 2017 or early 2018 , depending upon study initiation timeline .
1316175_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	During the third quarter of 2016, we initiated the EASY study, which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients who completed the SOLUTION study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	We plan to modif y this study to allow patients completing future studies (e.g., RESULT or SIMPLICITY Part B) to have continued access until the BLA for Sollpura is approved by the FDA.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	We believe our Sollpura studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed porcine-derived PERTs, including:
1316175_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	A product that is wholly non-porcine.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	a capsule formulation using known, safe, excipients that provides lower pill burden and good delivery performance.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	a sachet formulation containing Sollpura power for oral solution which can be easily dissolved into water, and finally provides patients, especially young pediatric patients, with an easy-to-swallow dosing option.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	In June 2013, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study, BRIGHT-SC study in Asian and Eastern Europe.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The BRIGHT-SC study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Enrollment criteria are biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr).
1316175_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Patients must be receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The BRIGHT-SC clinical study has enrolled patients in Southeast Asia, the European Union( EU ) and Eastern Europe.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	In March 2015, an interim futility analysis of BRIGHT-SC study was conducted by an independent unblinded statistician, who evaluated several important biomarkers of renal disease in patients who had completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	In June 2016, an interim analysis of the BRIGHT-SC study was conducted and the results showed a tendency toward lower proteinuria in blisibimod versus placebo treated patients.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	While the numerical reduction in proteinuria in blisibimod versus placebo treated patients at week 24 did not meet the predefined statistical primary endpoint of complete or partial response, longer-term data from the study demonstrated an increasingly large separation in proteinuria favoring the blisibimod treated arm compared to the placebo.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	Additionally, secondary biomarker data from the study, including changes in total B cell counts and changes in immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgM, were highly consistent with previous studies with blisibimod and demonstrated marked reduction after 8 weeks on study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	In December 2016, an additional interim analysis of the BRIGHT-SC study was reported.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	As with the analysis in June, the numerical reduction in proteinuria in blisibimod versus placebo treated patients at week 48 did not meet the predefined statistical primary endpoint of complete or partial response.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	However, there was again a tendency toward slowing proteinuria progression with blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	As a result of the increasing proteinuria effect after 48 weeks of dosing, and the demonstration of blisibimod s effect on immunological markers relevant to IgA nephropathy including reductions of B cells, and immunoglobulins including IgA, IgG and IgM, we elected to continue the study until the majority of patients have had the opportunity to complete 2 years of treatment.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	However, as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod, we began recognizing license fee revenue and collaborative revenue in 2015.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	The license fee from the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku was initially amortized as revenue over the performance obligation period (product development period) while reimbursement for our FTEs was recorded as collaborative revenues as incurred.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	In September 2015, we received a termination notice from Zenyaku to terminate the collaborative arrangement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	Consequently, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period and have fully amortized our deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidates development programs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: licensing, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for the continued development of blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	We are developing our product candidates in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, Blisibimod expense included reimbursed development costs totaling $1.5 million pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, Blisibimod expense included non-cash license fee $1.0 million in connection with an amendment to the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, Varespladib expense included a refund of $0.5 million from a vendor for our VISTA-16 clinical study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	All development efforts for Varespladib were terminated in 2012.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	As we obtain results from clinical studies, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain clinical development programs in order to focus our resources on more promising clinical development programs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	Completion of clinical studies may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of product candidates.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	The cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including:
1316175_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P40_S5	If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	None of our product candidates has received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions, including clinical, chemical manufacturing, regulatory, finance and business development.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	During 2015, we had a collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku which provided for various types of payments to us, including development milestones, sales milestone, royalty, and reimbursement for a portion of the Company s internal and external costs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	All payments from Zenyaku were nonrefundable.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	The collaborative arrangement was on a best-efforts basis, did not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation and provided for payment to be made when costs were incurred or services were performed.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	The collaboration was terminated on January 7, 2016 pursuant to a termination notice from Zenyaku to us.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	With respect to the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku, we recognized revenue in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 605 Revenue Recognition , subtopic ASC 605-25 Revenue with Multiple Element Arrangements and subtopic ASC 605-28 Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method , which provide accounting guidance for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and guidance on defining the milestone and determining when the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions is appropriate, respectively.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	For multiple-element arrangements, each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	The deliverables under the Zenyaku agreement had been determined to be a single unit of accounting and as such any license fees received were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated performance period under the agreement, which was the product development period.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	As a result of the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period in the third quarter of 2015 and fully amortized our deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	For the collaborative research activities, we were entitled to reimbursement from Zenyaku for our internal personnel cost at a pre-determined full time equivalent ( FTE ) rate.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Revenue related to FTE services was recognized as research services that were performed over the related performance periods.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	We were required to perform research and development activities as specified in the collaboration agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The payments received were not refundable and were based on a contractual reimbursement rate per FTE working on the project.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Reimbursement for FTE cost was recorded as collaborative revenue as incurred.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	We account for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our equity incentive plans under the provisions of ASC 718 which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	This model requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized ratably over the requisite service period of the award.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Due to the limited amount of historical data available to us, particularly with respect to stock-price volatility, employee exercise patterns and forfeitures, actual results could differ from our assumptions.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC 505, Equity.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	As a result, the non-cash charge to operations for non-employee options with service or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock, as the underlying equity instruments vest.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	The two factors which most affect these changes are the price of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock-based compensation is recorded and the volatility of the stock price.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company has issued certain financial instruments, including warrants to purchase common stock, which have the characteristics of both liability and equity.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	Financial instruments such as warrants that are evaluated to be classified as liabilities are fair valued upon issuance and are remeasured at fair value at subsequent reporting periods with the resulting change in fair value recorded in other income/(expense).
1316175_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	The fair value of warrants is estimated using the valuation models that require the input of subjective assumptions including stock price volatility and expected life .
1316175_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	As of December 31, 2016, all warrants have been reclassified from liability to equity.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	We make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	The majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P59_S4	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	We base our accruals related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P61_S4	In accruing for service fees, we estimate the time and materials incurred by these service providers in each period.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P61_S5	If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P61_S6	If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the termination of a collaborative partnership with Zenyaku.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	We began to recognize revenues in 2015 as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $2.6 million for the amortization of the license fee and $0.6 million for the reimbursement of FTEs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	License fee from the collaborative arrangement was amortized over the period of performance (product development period) while reimbursement for our FTEs was recorded as collaborative revenue.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P63_S4	In September 2015, we received a termination notice from Zenyaku to terminate the collaborative arrangement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P63_S5	Consequently, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period and fully amortized the deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Research and development expenses increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to costs associated with acceleration of the manufacturing scale-up timeline, including the production of demonstration and registration batches at commercial launch scale for Sollpura .
1316175_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Additionally, clinical development expense also increased from prior year due to the initiation of three new clinical studies, namely the CHABLIS-7.5 study with blisibimod in severe lupus patients, the SIMPLICITY study with Sollpura in sachet formulation and the EASY study which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients who rolled off the SOLUTION clinical study.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	General and administrative expenses increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2016 as a result of options issued in 2016 and higher expense related to professional services to support the growth of the Company.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table summarizes our research award for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Research award decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to the timing of achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	We achieved a majority of the milestones in 2015 and as a result we recognized $2.6 million out of total of $3.0 million in research award from CFFT for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Other income (expense) recorded in 2016 included change in fair value of warrant liability, interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the net impact of realized gain or loss from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	In connection with the subscription agreement for the sale of convertible preferred stock entered in September 2016, we issued common stock warrants to certain institutional investors.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The initial fair value of the liability associated with these warrants was $3.7 million, and the fair value decreased to $1.9 million when the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants became fixed in November 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	The changes in the fair value of the warrants is recognized in the statement of operations in the year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P72_S3	Other i ncome (expense) recorded in 2015 was mainly a result of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the net impact of realized gain or loss from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $2.6 million for the amortization of the license fee and $0.6 million for the reimbursement of FTEs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	License fee from the collaborative arrangement was amortized over the period of performance (product development period) while reimbursement for our FTEs was recorded as collaborative revenue.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	In September 2015, we received a termination notice from Zenyaku to terminate the collaborative arrangement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P74_S4	Consequently, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period and have fully amortized our deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Research and development expenses increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation recognized in 2015 as a result of options issued in 2015 and higher expense in manufacturing and CRO fees to support the ongoing CHABLIS-SC1 and BRIGHT-SC studies and enable the initiation of our Phase 3 SOLUTION study with Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	The increase is partially offset by $1.5 million in expense reimbursements from Zenyaku for certain development costs associated with blisibimod.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $2.6 million in research award from CFFT in connection with achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	The amount has been recognized as a component of Operating Expenses.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	There was no research award recognized in 2014.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Other income (expense) recorded in 2015 and 2014 was mainly a result of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the net impact of realized gain or loss from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	There was no interest expense recorded in 2015 due to the full payment of our long-term debt in 2014.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt, debt financings and public offerings of common stock, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a collaborative partner, and a research award from CFFT.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $20.8 million.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, and our capital expenditure needs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	In September 2016, we entered into a subscription agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which we sold 17,000 Series X units for a purchase price of $1,000 per unit in a registered direct offering.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Each unit consists of one share of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase 126.96 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.36 per share, which is a 20% premium over the conversion price of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $17.0 million.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	The subscription agreement provides that the investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make an additional investment of up to $28.3 million within 20 trading days following our initial public announcement of top-line data from our SOLUTION study ( Additional Investment ).
1316175_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	No further investments were made by the investors and the right for Additional Investment expired on January 26, 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	On April 21, 2016, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement ( ATM Agreement ) with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC ( H.C. Wainwright ) to create an at-the-market equity program under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million through H.C. Wainwright, as agent.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	$2.7 million was sold during the year ended December 31, 2016, leaving a balance of $22.3 million available for future sale pursuant to the Agreement.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	In July 2015, we amended the Purchase Agreement and reduced the amount LPC can purchase to an aggregate of $6.0 million of common stock over a period of two years.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	On April 27, 2016, we amended the Purchase Agreement with LPC, pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in shares of common stock by March 12, 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P88_S3	As of December 31, 2016, $1.6 million had been sold through the Purchase Agreement, leaving a balance of $13.4 million available for future sale pursuant to the Agreement.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had sold $24.3 million of common stock through the ATM program, of which $2.5 million was sold during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	The Agreement was terminated on April 21, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	In March 2016, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-210166) for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	On April 21, 2016, we registered $25.0 million under the registration statement for the H.C. Wainwright ATM Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	On March 14, 2017, we amended the H.C. Wainwright ATM Agreement and reduced the amount registered under the registration statement to $23 million.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P90_S3	On April 27, 2016, we registered $14.4 million under the registration statement for the LPC Purchase Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P90_S4	On March 12, 2017, upon the expiration of the LPC Purchase Agreement, $13.4 million of unused amount became available under the registration statement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	On September 8, 2016, we registered $22.1 million under the registration statement for a subscription agreement with certain institutional investors for the sale of convertible preferred stock and issuance of warrants in a registered direct offering.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	On March 14, 2017, we entered into an equity underwriting agreement H.C. Wainwright, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 30,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $15 million.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	Under the terms of the underwriter agreement, we granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase an additional 4,500,000 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 9,000,000 shares of common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	The financing transaction is expected to close on March 17, 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P91_S4	In connection with this registered direct offering of common stock and warrants, we registered $53.5 million under the registration statement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P91_S5	As of the date of this report, there is a balance of $0.4 million available for future issuance under the registration statement.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	We do not believe our current capital is sufficient to fund our operating plan through March 2018.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Accordingly, our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain a going concern qualification from our independent registered public accounting firm.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	Despite the capacity remaining under our registration statement and the remaining amounts available under our ATM and LPC Purchase Agreement, pursuant to Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3, we may not sell more than the equivalent of one-third of our public float during any 12 consecutive months so long as our public float is less than $75 million, which will limit our ability to raise funds using those facilities.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S3	As of March 11, 2017, our public float is approximately $34.8 million.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S4	Other than those facilities, we currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S5	Any such financing could be difficult to obtain on favorable terms or at all.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S6	If we are unable to raise additional funds, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate some of our clinical trials and our development programs.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S7	Even if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms and, in such event, the market price of our common stock may decline and further dilution to our existing stockholders will result.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P92_S8	In addition, the expectation of future dilution as a result of our offering of securities convertible into equity securities may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	We will need substantial additional financing to continue the development of our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals, and prepare for commercial readiness if the clinical trials are successful; such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of this report.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	implement new operational, financial and management information systems.
1316175_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.

1316175_17_ITEM7_P113_S3	To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements.

1316175_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to that company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1316175_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1316175_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(e), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this report.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor or ( BAFF ) which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), or lupus, lupus nephritis, and others.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company s planned principal operations are acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital and performing research and development activities.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company is currently conducting research and development activities to treat autoimmune diseases and EPI.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets; secure financing; develop a customer base; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and develop strategic alliances.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	Since inception in 2004, the Company has funded its operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, debt financing, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a former collaborative partner, Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. ( Zenyaku ), and a research award from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT").
1316175_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	On April 21, 2016, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement ( ATM Agreement ) with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC ( H.C. Wainwright ) to create an at-the-market equity program under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25 million through H.C. Wainwright, as agent, which was amended and reduced to $23 million on March 14, 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	In September 2016, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with certain institutional investors pursuant to which it sold 17,000 units for a purchase price of $1,000 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of the Company s Series X convertible preferred stock, which are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock, and warrants to purchase up to a number of shares of common stock equal to 25% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the of Series X convertible preferred stock, in a registered direct offering.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $17.0 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company s capital resources consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $20.8 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	On March 14, 2017, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with H.C. Wainwright, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell and aggregate of 30,000,000 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $15 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P28_S2	Under the terms of the underwriter agreement, we granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase an additional 4,500,000 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 9,000,000 shares of common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P28_S3	The financing transaction is expected to close on March 17, 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	To fully execute its business plan, the Company will need to complete certain research and development activities and clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	Further, the Company s product candidates will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P29_S2	These activities may span many years and require substantial capital to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P29_S3	Any delays in completing these activities could adversely impact the Company.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P29_S4	The Company will need substantial additional financing to continue development of its product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals, and prepare for commercial readiness if the clinical trials are successful; such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of this report.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P29_S5	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P29_S6	If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of its clinical trials.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company plans to meet its capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, future partnerships, debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date and has disclosed all events or transactions that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K that would require recognition or disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	During 2015, the Company had a collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. ( Zenyaku ) which provided for various types of payments from Zenyaku, including development milestones, sales milestone, royalty, and reimbursement for a portion of the Company s internal and external costs.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	All payments from Zenyaku are nonrefundable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P33_S2	The collaborative arrangement was on a best-efforts basis, did not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation and provided for payment to be made when costs were incurred or services were performed.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P33_S3	The collaboration was terminated on January 7, 2016 pursuant to a termination notice from Zenyaku to the Company.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	With respect to the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku, the Company recognized revenue in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 605 Revenue Recognition , subtopic ASC 605-25 Revenue with Multiple Element Arrangements and subtopic ASC 605-28 Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method , which provide accounting guidance for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and guidance on defining the milestone and determining when the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions is appropriate, respectively.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	For multiple-element arrangements, each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	The deliverables under the Zenyaku agreement had been determined to be a single unit of accounting and as such any license fees received were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated performance period under the agreement, which was the product development period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	As a result of an early termination of the Zenyaku agreement, the Company revised the amortization period of its deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period in the third quarter of 2015 and had fully amortized its deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	For the collaborative research activities, the Company was entitled to reimbursement from Zenyaku for its internal personnel cost at a pre-determined full time equivalent ( FTE ) rate.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	Revenue related to FTE services was recognized as research services were performed over the related performance periods.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P37_S2	The Company was required to perform research and development activities as specified in the collaboration agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P37_S3	The payments received were not refundable and were based on a contractual reimbursement rate per FTE working on the project.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P37_S4	Reimbursement for FTE costs was recorded as collaborative revenue as incurred.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical accounting policies or estimates related to clinical trial accruals, tax provision, stock-based compensation, warrant liabilities, and computation of beneficial conversion features.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P38_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P38_S3	Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company has issued certain financial instruments, including warrants to purchase common stock, which have the characteristics of both liability and equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	Financial instruments such as warrants that are evaluated to be classified as liabilities are fair valued upon issuance and are remeasured at fair value at subsequent reporting periods with the resulting change in fair value recorded in other income/(expense).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	The fair value of warrants is estimated using the valuation models that require the input of subjective assumptions including stock price volatility and expected life.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P39_S3	As of December 31, 2016, all warrants have been reclassified from liability to equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	Cash equivalents consist primarily of cash currencies and money market funds, for which the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P40_S2	Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to five years, using the straight-line method.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the life of the related asset, whichever is shorter.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company s long-lived assets and other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P45_S2	Through December 31, 2016, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations and other service providers that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P46_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P46_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P46_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies are generally accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on the Company s behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	The majority of service providers invoice at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P47_S2	The Company periodically confirms the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and makes adjustments if necessary.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P47_S3	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	Clinical study expenses are further separated into two main categories: clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with manufacturing campaigns, product formulation and chemical analysis.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company charges research and development costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	Clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	All of the Company s clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P51_S3	The Company accrues costs for clinical studies performed by CROs based on patient enrollment activities and adjusts the estimates, if required, based upon the Company s ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P51_S4	The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the CROs, and adjusts the estimates, if required, on a monthly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended by each CRO.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	All material CRO contracts are terminable by the Company upon written notice and the Company is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain noncancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company operates in only one segment.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company s long-lived tangible assets consist of mainly machinery purchased by the Company and installed by its contract manufacturing vendors.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	The machinery are used for all of the Company s product manufacturing campaigns.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, and rights to purchase shares under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and recognizes the costs in its consolidated financial statements over the employees requisite service period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P56_S2	Additionally, the Company is required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs, which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight-line basis.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	Expected Term The Company s expected term represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method, which is computed as the arithmetic mean of weighted vested period and contractual life.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	Expected Volatility Expected volatility is estimated using the Company s historical stock prices.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has never paid dividends and has no plans to pay dividends.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing method is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	The estimated forfeiture rate is determined based on the Company s historical forfeiture rates to date.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company monitors actual forfeitures and periodically updates the estimate.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and recognized as expense over the related service period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	The standards update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to utilize to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that will be received in exchange for the goods and services.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P63_S2	Additional disclosures will also be required to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P63_S3	In 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards updates to address implementation issues and to clarify the guidance for identifying performance obligations, licenses and determining if a company is the principal or agent in a revenue arrangement.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	The mandatory adoption date of ASC 606 for the Company is now January 1, 2018.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P64_S2	There are two methods of adoption allowed, either a full retrospective adoption or a modified retrospective adoption.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P64_S3	The Company expects to adopt the standard on a modified retrospective basis applying the new rules to all contract existing at January 1, 2018, with an adjustment for the cumulative effect of all changes recognized in beginning retained earnings.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P64_S4	Given that the Company is not currently generating revenue and most likely will not be generating revenue at the date of adoption, the adoption of this guidance will not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. .
1316175_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	In September 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 , Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	ASU 2014-15 defines when and how companies are required to disclose going concern uncertainties, which must be evaluated each interim and annual period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P65_S2	Specifically, the ASU requires management to determine whether substantial doubt exists regarding the entity s going concern presumption.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	Substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	If substantial doubt exists, certain disclosures are required; the extent of those disclosures depends on an evaluation of management s plans (if any) to mitigate the going concern uncertainty.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within that fiscal year.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P66_S3	The Company has adopted this guidance during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance on the classification of deferred taxes, ASU No. 2015-17 ( ASU 2015-17 ), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	ASU 2015-17 eliminates the guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes , that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P67_S2	The amendments require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single amount in a classified balance sheet.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P67_S3	The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P67_S4	Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of any interim period or annual reporting period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P67_S5	The Company adopted this guidance during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	ASU 2016-02 impacts any entity that enters into a lease with some specified scope exceptions.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P68_S2	This new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P68_S3	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P68_S4	The guidance updates and supersedes Topic 840, Leases.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods with those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P71_S2	ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P71_S3	The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P71_S4	The Company continues to evaluate ASU 2016-09 and at the current time has not quantified the effects adoption of the new standard will have on its financial statements.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	In March 2015, the Company received a research award of up to $3 million from the CFFT for the Company's development of Sollpura.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company retains the right to develop and commercialize Sollpura and will owe royalties to CFFT on net sales of any drug candidate approved and commercialized under the collaboration.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P72_S2	The funding is disbursed by CFFT to the Company upon the Company s achievement of milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P72_S3	At its discretion, the Company may choose to fund a particular stage of the Sollpura development plan without CFFT funds.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P72_S4	Any CFFT funds not expended on the development program of Sollpura must be returned to CFFT and, upon such return, the amounts of such returned funds will not be included as part of the research award for the purpose of calculating royalties or other amounts owed by the Company to CFFT.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	To the extent CFFT provides or makes available any information, expertise, know-how or other intellectual property related to cystic fibrosis or the treatment, prevention or cure there-of ( CFFT Know-How ) to the Company, CFFT grants to the Company a non-exclusive, transferrable, sublicensable, worldwide rights and license under all of CFFT s rights in such CFFT Know-How to assist the Company to research, develop, commercialize, make or have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import, export and otherwise exploit the product.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	In consideration for CFFT s research award and any licenses of intellectual property granted by CFFT, the Company agreed to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to five times the actual award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized $0.3 million of research award from CFFT in connection with achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	The amount has been recognized as a component of operating expense, which offsets total operating expense.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P76_S2	Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P76_S3	Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and readily accessible by us at the reporting date.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there are little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	The following tables present the Company s fair value hierarchy for all its financial assets (including those in cash and cash equivalents), in thousands, by major security type measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of cash equivalents, which consist of money market funds and therefore these are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	Pursuant to the subscription agreement for the sale of convertible preferred stock entered in September 2016, the Company issued common stock warrants to the institutional investors.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S1	Each warrant has an exercise price equal to 120% of the conversion price of the Series X convertible preferred stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S2	The warrants are exercisable after March 13, 2017 and expire on September 13, 2019.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S3	The Company accounted for the warrants under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S4	The fair value of the warrants are measured and recorded as a liability because the strike price and number of shares underlying the warrants were unknown upon issuance.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S5	At the end of each reporting period, the changes in fair value during the period are recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S6	The initial fair value of the liability associated with these warrants was $3.7 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S7	On November 16, 2016, five days f ollowing the announcement of the Company s CHABLIS-SC1 clinical study , the conversion price of the Series X convertible preferred stock became fixed.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S8	As a result, the warrant exercise price was fixed at $2.36 and the number of shares underlying the warrants was fixed at 2,158,236.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S9	The Company remeasured the fair value of the warrants at $1.9 million as of November 16, 2016 and recorded the reduction in fair value subsequent to the issuance date of $1.7 million as part of non-operating income in its consolidated statements of operations.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P83_S10	In addition, as the exercise price became fixed, the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	The following table summarizes the change of warrant liability (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	The exercise price and number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants were not determinable upon issuance and as such the estimated fair value was determined by using the Monte Carlo simulation model on September 14, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P85_S1	On November 16, 2016, the Company estimated the fair value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model as the exercise price and number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants were fixed.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P85_S2	Inputs used in the valuation on each date were as follows:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	For the fair value determination on November 16, 2016, the Company computed the expected volatility based on daily pricing observations for a period that corresponds to the expected term of the warrants.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	For the fair value determination on September 14, 2016, the Company determined the expected volatility based on both historical and implied volatilities.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P86_S2	Historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for a period that corresponds to the expected term of the warrants while implied volatility was computed using publicly traded options of the Company as well as the Company s peer companies.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P86_S3	The Company believes this method produces an estimate that is representative of its expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P86_S4	The expected term for both valuation dates are based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P86_S5	The risk-free interest rates are the U.S. Treasury bond rate as of the valuation dates.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	See Footnote 15 Subsequent Event for warrants issued after December 31, 2016 and before the date of this report.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	Under the terms of the Zenyaku Agreement, the Company had the right to receive an upfront and forgivable loan of $7.0 million, milestone payments of up to $22.0 million contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, and up to $15.0 million in sales of the Company s common stock at a purchase price equal to 1.3 times the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock for 20 trading days prior to the delivery of the closing notice (the Premium Purchase Price ).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	Not all the conditions required to secure the forgivable loan were met and therefore, the Company had not exercised its right to receive the loan from Zenyaku.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P91_S2	During 2015, the Company had exercised its right with respect to $11.0 million of the $15.0 million in equity puts to Zenyaku, of which $9.0 million was received through the issuance of 2,946,810 shares of common stock and the Company does not expect to receive the remaining $2.0 million.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P93_S2	There were no termination penalties incurred by the Company in connection with the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement by Zenyaku.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P93_S3	No patients had been enrolled in any blisibimod clinical studies in the Zenyaku territory and Zenyaku.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P93_S4	The Company regained global rights of blisibimod on January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P93_S5	As a result of the Termination Notice, the Company changed the amortization period of its deferred revenue and has fully amortized its deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company leases its main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P94_S1	The lease is for approximately 14,000 square feet and the lease agreement will expire in September 2017.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P96_S1	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company paid a nonrefundable, upfront license fee of $6.0 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P96_S2	As there was no future alternative use for the technology, the Company expensed the license fee in research and development expenses during 2007.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P96_S3	Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, the Company is obligated to make additional milestone payments to Amgen of up to $33.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	In connection with the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku pursuant to the Zenyaku Agreement, the Company amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of the collaboration between Anthera and Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by Anthera to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P97_S1	Under this amendment, Anthera also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of its common stock equal $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P97_S2	The Company issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015, pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	The outcome of the legal proceeding is inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	No provision for loss nor disclosure is required in relation to this action because a reasonably possible loss or range of losses cannot be estimated.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Company s Board of Directors is authorized to designate the terms and conditions of any preferred stock issued by the Company without further action by the common stockholders.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P104_S4	Based on a conversion price of $1.9692 per share, on November 16, 2016 the date the number of shares subject to redemption was fixed, the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock were convertible into 8,632,947 shares of common stock, which exceeds the Threshold Amount by 247,119 shares of common stock or 487 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P104_S5	As of December 31, 2016, 7,501 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into 3,809,160 shares of common stock and no warrants had been exercised.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Company allocated the proceeds from the financing amongst the Series X Convertible Preferred Shares, the warrants to purchase shares of common stock, and the investors rights to purchase shares of Series X-1 Convertible Preferred Stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	The accounting for each component on issuance and through December 31, 2016 is as follows:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	Series X Convertible Preferred Stock Due to the contingent redemption feature related to NASDAQ conversion limits that could result in a potential redemption for cash, the Company initially classified the 17,000 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock in the mezzanine section (between equity and liabilities) on the date of issuance.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P108_S1	The Company recorded the residual value of these shares at $9.6 million, which is net of allocation of $3.7 million to the fair value of the warrants to purchase common stock and $3.7 million to the relative fair value of the rights to purchase Series X-1 Convertible Preferred Stock on the date of issuance.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P108_S2	On November 16, 2016, the conversion price became fixed at $1.9692 and therefore, the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 8,632,947 shares of common stock, which exceeded the aggregate number of common stock permitted for conversion by 247,119 shares or 487 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P108_S3	Therefore, the 487 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock remained contingently redeemable on November 16, 2016 and shareholders approval will be required for the conversion of these shares; the remaining 16,513 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock ceased to be redeemable and were reclassified from the mezzanine section to equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company determined that, on the date of issuance, the warrants were not considered indexed to its own stock because the underlying instruments were not fixed-for-fixed and therefore, the warrants should be accounted for as derivatives.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P109_S1	The warrants were initially measured at fair value at inception of $3.7 million and recorded as a liability with a corresponding entry to Series X Convertible Preferred Stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P109_S2	On November 16, 2016, the Company remeasured the fair value of the warrants when the exercise price for the warrants became fixed and recorded the change in fair value as part of other income/expense in the Company s statement of operation.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P109_S3	The fair value of the Company s warrant liability is discussed in Note 5.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P109_S4	The number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants also became fixed on November 16, 2016 and therefore, the related warrant liability of $1.9 million was reclassified as stockholders equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P110_S0	Rights to Purchase Series X-1 Convertible Preferred Stock The Company determined that the investors rights to purchase future shares of Series X-1 Convertible Preferred Stock was a freestanding instrument on issuance.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P110_S1	The instrument is treated as equity due to the permanent equity classification of the underlying Series X-1 Convertible Preferred Stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P110_S2	The right was allocated based on its relative fair value of $3.7 million to the proceeds of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock and recorded as part of permanent equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P110_S3	Subsequent to issuance, the Company determined that investors right to purchase future shares of Series X-1 Convertible Preferred Stock would not be exercised.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P110_S4	As such, the Company reclassified $3.6 million to the Series X shares in permanent equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P110_S5	At December 31, 2016, no amount remained associated with the Tranche Right.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the option related to the rights to purchase Series X-1 Convertible Preferred Stock on the date of issuance:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	Beneficial Conversion Feature Because the conversion price of the shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock was less than the fair value of the Company s common stock at the date of issuance, the in-the-money conversion feature (Beneficial Conversion Feature, or BCF) requires separate financial statement recognition and is measured at the intrinsic value (i.e., the amount of the increase in value that preferred stockholders would realize upon conversion based on the value of the conversion shares on the issuance date).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P112_S1	The initial BCF of $8.8 million was recorded as a discount to the Contingently Redeemable Series X Convertible Preferred Stock in mezzanine and was immediately accreted as a deemed preferred stock dividend and, accordingly, an adjustment to net loss to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P112_S2	The BCF was reassessed on November 16, 2016 when the conversion price of the Series X shares became fixed and resulted in an additional $0.8 million being recorded as a reduction to the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock in permanent equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P112_S3	No deemed dividend was recorded as the shares were no longer redeemable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	Conversion of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock On December 7, 2016, pursuant to a conversion notice received from one of the holders of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company converted 7,501 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock into 3,809,160 shares of common stock, leaving a balance of 9,499 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P113_S1	The conversion was reflected as a reduction in Series X Convertible Preferred Stock in permanent equity.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	As of December 31, 2016, 487 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock were contingently redeemable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P114_S1	The redemption value is dependent on the 2-day VWAP of the Company s common stock on the date of conversion.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	In March 2016, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-210166) for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.

Wainwright, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 30,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $15 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P116_S2	Under the terms of the underwriter agreement, we granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase an additional 4,500,000 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 9,000,000 shares of common stock.

Wainwright ATM Agreement ) under which the Company from time to time may offer and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million through H.C. Wainwright, as agent.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P117_S1	On March 14, 2017, the Company amended the H.C. Wainwright ATM Agreement and reduced the amount of aggregate offering price to $23.0 million.

Wainwright ATM Agreement, leaving a balance of $20.3 million available for future sale pursuant to the H.C. Wainwright ATM Agreement as of the date of this report.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	On March 12, 2015, the Company executed an equity purchase agreement with LPC, pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $10.0 million in shares of common stock over a period of two years.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P118_S1	In July 2015, the Company amended the equity purchase agreement to reduce the amount available for purchase to $6.0 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P118_S2	On April 27, 2016, the Company amended the equity purchase agreement and increased the amount of common stock available for purchase to $15.0 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P118_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the Company sold approximately $1.6 million in shares of common stock pursuant to the equity purchase agreement.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P118_S5	The equity purchase agreement expired on March 12, 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	Based on the requirements of Form S-3, however, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in the Company s common stock and stock price, which may limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through Purchase Agreement and registration statements described above.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company had reserved the following shares for future issuance:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P121_S0	In connection with a venture debt executed in March 2011, the Company issued a seven-year warrant to the lender for the purchase of 40,178 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $48.00 per share.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P121_S1	The warrant was immediately exercisable and expires in March 2018.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P121_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the warrant remained outstanding and exercisable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P122_S0	In connection with the issuance of Series X convertible preferred stock in September 2016, the Company issued warrants to certain institutional investors to purchase shares of the Company s common stock.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P122_S2	The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time after March 13, 2017, and will expire on September 13, 2019.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P122_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the warrants remained outstanding but not exercisable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S0	On March 25, 2013, the Company s board of directors adopted the 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan ), which was also approved by the Company s stockholders at its annual general meeting on May 16, 2013.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S1	The Company initially reserved 1,750,000 shares of its common stock for the issuance of awards under the 2013 Plan, plus all shares remaining available for grant under the Company s 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan), plus any additional shares returned under the 2010 Plan or 2013 Plan as a result of the cancellation, forfeiture or other termination (other than by exercise) of awards issued pursuant to the 2010 Plan or 2013 Plan, subject in all cases to adjustment including reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the Company s capital stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S2	In May 2015, the Company s shareholders approved an increase of 1,790,818 shares to the 2013 Plan pool.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S3	In April 2016, the Company s shareholders approved an increase of 1,600,000 shares to the 2013 Plan pool.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S4	Of the shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan, no more than 750,000 shares will be issued to any individual participant as incentive options, non-qualified options or stock appreciation rights during any calendar year.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S5	The 2013 Plan permits the granting of incentive and non-statutory stock options, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance share awards, cash-based awards and dividend equivalent rights to eligible employees, directors and consultants.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S6	The option exercise price of an option granted under the 2013 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock on the date the stock option is granted.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S7	Options granted under the 2013 Plan have a maximum term of 10 years and generally vest over four years.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S8	In addition, in the case of certain large stockholders, the minimum exercise price of incentive options must equal 110% of fair market value on the date of grant and the maximum term is limited to five years.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P123_S9	Subject to overall Plan limitations, the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued in the form of incentive options shall not exceed 6,250,000 shares of common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P124_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity for 2014, 2015 and 2016:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2016, there were 472,676 shares available for grant under the 2013 Plan.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value stock options are as follows:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	The intrinsic value of stock options represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options and the market price of our stock on that day for all in-the-money options.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P127_S1	Additional information related to our stock options is summarized below (in thousands except per share information):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	There was $6.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense as of December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P128_S1	The unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining period of 2.54 years.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	Information about stock options outstanding, vested and exercisable as of December 31, 2016, was as follows:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	Effective July 2010, under the terms of the ESPP, eligible employees of the Company may authorize the Company to deduct amounts from their compensation, which amounts are used to enable the employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P130_S1	The Company initially reserved 12,500 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder plus on January 1, 2011 and each January 1 thereafter, the number of shares of stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) 31,250 shares of common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P130_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 18,502, 60,444 and 25,000 shares were issued pursuant to the purchase of common stock by our employees under the ESPP, respectively.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P130_S3	As of December 31, 2016, there were 68,677 shares available for grant under the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	Under the ESPP, eligible employees of the Company may authorize the Company to deduct amounts from their compensation, which amounts are used to enable the employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P131_S1	The purchase price per share is 85% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the first date or the ending date of the applicable semi-annual purchase period, whichever is less (the Look-Back Provision ).
1316175_17_ITEM15_P131_S2	The 15% discount and the Look-Back Provision make the ESPP compensatory.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to value the employee stock purchase rights.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P132_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the following weighted-average assumptions were used in the valuation of the stock purchase rights:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense, including expense recorded for the ESPP, was as follows (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	Included in general and administrative expense was approximately $1.5 million in stock-based compensation associated with the cancellation of options by a former employee in December 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P135_S0	Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P135_S1	Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P136_S0	The computation of diluted Earnings Per Share, or EPS, is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P136_S1	In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P136_S2	The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P137_S0	Diluted EPS is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P138_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s calculation of net loss per common share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P139_S0	The following outstanding potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the effect of including them would have been antidilutive:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan, or the 401(k) Plan.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P140_S1	Employee contributions are voluntary and are determined on an individual basis, limited by the maximum amounts allowable under federal tax regulations.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P140_S2	Prior to 2011, the Company had not made any contributions to the 401(k) Plan.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P140_S3	In December 2012, the Company amended its 401(k) plan to provide for non-elective employer contribution at the Company s discretion.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P140_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company contributed approximately $264,000, $284,000 and $185,000, respectively, in non-elective employer contribution into the employees 401(k) accounts.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company s loss before provision for income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was a domestic loss of $66.4 million, $35.2 million and $29.6 million, respectively.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P142_S0	The Company has incurred net operating losses since inception.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P142_S1	The Company has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P143_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P144_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P145_S0	The significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P146_S0	The reconciliation between the Company s effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations and the statutory tax rates for the years ended December 2016, 2015, and 2014 is as follows:
1316175_17_ITEM15_P147_S0	Tax benefits of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carryforwards are recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is more likely than not.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P147_S1	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P147_S2	Because of the Company s history of operating losses, management believes that the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits are currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P147_S3	The net valuation allowance increased by $12.0 million in 2016, $14.3 million in 2015, and $11.7 million in 2014.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P148_S0	The amount of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with excess tax deductions from stock-based compensation arrangements that would be allocated to contributed capital if the future tax benefits are subsequently recognized is $0.3 million.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P149_S0	Net operating losses and tax return credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P150_S0	Utilization of the domestic NOL and tax credit forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382, as well as similar state provisions.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	In general, an ownership change, as defined by the code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P151_S1	Any limitation may result in expiration of all or a portion of the NOL or tax credit carryforwards before utilization.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1.7 million, all of which would not currently affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company s deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P152_S1	The Company did not anticipate any significant change to the unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P152_S2	A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company would classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, if applicable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	There was no interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through December 31, 2016.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P153_S2	The tax years 2004 through 2016 remain open to examination by one or more major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized net tax benefits will significantly change prior to the end of 2017.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	Quarterly results were as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
1316175_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	On January 27, 2017, a purchase right provided to certain investors to make additional investments (see Note 9) became expired and unexercised.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	On January 5 and 30, 2017, the Company received conversion notices from holders of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock and converted 9,012 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock into 4,576,349 shares of common stock.

1316175_17_ITEM15_P158_S1	Each Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 Warrant has an exercise price of $0.55 and $0.50 per share, respectively.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P158_S2	The Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 Warrants will become exercisable on any day on or after the date that the Company has sufficient authorized shares of common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P158_S3	The Tranche 1 Warrant will expire five years following the Exercisable Date and the Tranche 2 Warrant will expire six months following the Exercisable Date.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	The shares of common stock and accompanying warrants were immediately separable.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P159_S1	Under the terms of the underwriter agreement, we granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase an additional 4,500,000 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 9,000,000 shares of common stock.
1316175_17_ITEM15_P159_S2	The financing transaction is expected to close on March 17, 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary closing condition.

1316175_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	We currently have two compounds in development, Sollpura and blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	We licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The exocrine pancreas is responsible for synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, including lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	In addition, the pancreas secretes bicarbonate into the duodenum to neutralize the very high acidity of stomach contents.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	EPI occurs when diseases such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) and chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	A reduction in, or absence of, the normally secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes causes lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to enter the distal gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract in un-absorbable forms, leading to GI pain and distention, mal-digestion, and steatorrhea.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Without appropriate therapy, patients with EPI may experience malnutrition, poor growth, weight loss, reduced quality of life, and, in severe cases, increased morbidity and early death.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	PERT is currently the mainstay of treatment for nutrient malabsorption in patients with digestive enzyme deficiencies known as EPI and orally delivered porcine PERTs have been available for many years for its treatment.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	As the porcine-derived proteins contained in the PERTs pass through the low pH environment of the stomach, they are protected by the enteric coating until they reach a pH of approximately 5.6 or greater in the duodenum and then are rapidly released.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Due to the bulk imposed by the enteric coating, most patients have to take 10-20 capsules per day in order to maintain their nutritional requirement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Patient-to-patient differences in the acidity of the upper intestine makes dissolution of enterically-coated products variable, and gives rise to alterations in the rate and extent to which enzymes are released from these products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	Poor stability and variability in terms of potency and pharmaceutical properties have also been identified as important factors contributing to a poor response of some patients to PERTs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Sollpura is a novel, non-porcine PERT that contains three biotechnology-derived digestive enzymes: a lipase, a protease and an amylase.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Through enzyme cross-linking, the lipase enzyme in Sollpura is more stable than the porcine-derived lipase in the low pH environment of the stomach and therefore Sollpura does not have an enteric polymer coating.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	Furthermore, since the three enzymes in Sollpura are biotechnology-derived, Sollpura does not contain porcine proteins or purines that may be associated with a risk of viral transmission or allergic reaction to proteins of porcine origin.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	The individual enzyme components of Sollpura are formulated at a fixed ratio of lipase, protease, and amylase.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Sollpura enzyme dose ratio was selected from nonclinical efficacy studies conducted using a canine model of pancreatic insufficiency which demonstrated that the lipase enzyme in Sollpura was efficacious when administered at 500 units/kg per meal, and the protease doses 1000 units/kg per meal.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	The suitability of the enzyme ratio in Sollpura is further supported by the observation that Sollpura and Creon were equi-effective in pigs with surgically-induced pancreatic insufficiency.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe Sollpura has the potential to become the first soluble, stable and non-porcine derived enzyme product and offer a novel solution to patients who are unable to maintain appropriate nutritional health.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Sollpura s chemical characteristics, unlike currently available PERTs, make it ideal for powder formulation as either a capsule, or sachet of powder for oral solution which can be conveniently administered in solution in a small volume of water.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	We initiated a Phase 3 study of Sollpura ("RESULT") in patients with EPI due to cystic fibrosis in May 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	The RESULT study is a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the non-inferiority of Sollpura with respect to Coefficient of Fat Absorption ( CFA ) compared to a commercially available PERT in a population of porcine-derived PERT responders.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	The RESULT study s design is modified from a previous Phase 3 study s ( SOLUTION ) design to account for the design limitations in the SOLUTION study by 1) starting Sollpura dosing as 125% of the pre-study PERT dose, 2) allowing for a more real life dose adjustment, as needed, based on signs and symptoms throughout the primary treatment phase of the study, and 3) a shorter treatment duration of 4 weeks, with 3 weeks of dose optimization and 1 week of stable dosing.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	Patients are then followed in a 20-week extension period for the collection of longer term safety and efficacy (e.g., growth, maintenance of body weight) data.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	The RESULT study design was discussed with the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) prior to initiation.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P15_S5	Furthermore, the study had been approved by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network ( CFFTDN ) Protocol Review Committee, and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trial Network Executive Committee.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	The RESULT study enrolled 140 patients in North America, Eastern and Western Europe and Israel.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	In December 2017 and January 2018, pre-specified interim futility analyses of the RESULT study were conducted by a Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) comprised of experts appointed by the CFFTDN when approximately 25% and 50% of patients had completed the 4-week treatment period; in each instance, the committee recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	We expect to report topline data from the RESULT study in March 2018.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	A second, smaller Phase 3 study ( SIMPLICITY ) aimed at expanding the treatment age of patients to include patients age 28 days to seven years old, and enabling potential marketing approval for the sachet presentation of Sollpura, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	The SIMPLICITY study utilizes sachets containing Sollpura powder for oral solution.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	The study is designed in two parts (Part A and Part B).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Part A which evaluated the safety and general usability of Sollpura powder for oral solution in 15 patients 7 years of age, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	On December 9, 2016, an independent Data Monitoring Committee evaluated the data from Part A and approved progression to Part B, which will enroll pediatric subjects below 7 years of age.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	Before we proceed with Part B, we plan to amend the SIMPLICITY study to follow a similar dosing approach as in the RESULT study and initiate enrollment in Part B in the second quarter of 2018.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Furthermore, during the third quarter of 2016, we initiated the EASY study, which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients in the Sollpura arm who completed the SOLUTION study.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	We have amended this study to also allow Sollpura-assigned patients completing the RESULT study at a lipase dose greater than 10,000 units/kg/day to have continued access until the Biological License Application ( BLA ) for Sollpura is approved by the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Lastly, prior to the RESULT study, we conducted another Phase 3 study ( SOLUTION ) in patients with EPI.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	The SOLUTION study was also a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	This pivotal study enrolled 128 patients in North America, Europe and Israel.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	Top line data announced in December 2016 showed that the study narrowly missed the CFA non-inferiority margin of the primary mITT analysis by one percent; however, by additional pre-specified analyses of CFA (mITT-Baseline Observation Carried Forward and Per Protocol), Sollpura met the non-inferiority criterion.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P20_S4	The study also demonstrated that the ratio of the three enzymes in Sollpura provided an appropriate response in coefficient of nitrogen absorption ( CNA").
1316175_18_ITEM1_P20_S5	In March 2017, we announced data from the extension phase of the study, which showed that Sollpura demonstrated comparable maintenance in key measurements of height, weight, and body mass index in addition to being well tolerated throughout the 12-week extension period.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe our Sollpura studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed porcine-derived PERTs, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	a sachet formulation containing Sollpura powder for oral solution which can be easily dissolved into water, and finally provides patients, especially young pediatric patients, with an easy-to-swallow dosing option.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	BAFF, or B-cell Activating Factor (also known as B lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS), is a member of a tumor necrosis family of natural human proteins and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell lineages as well as plasma cells all of which are critical to the human immune response.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and other dangerous antigens.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	Abnormally high elevations of BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including lupus and IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	IgA nephropathy may occur when plasma cells express excessive amounts of under-glycosylated IgA and subsequent immune complexes containing this immunogenic protein are deposited in the kidneys.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	These IgA containing immune complexes deposit in the mesangium of glomeruli in the kidney and are proinflammatory.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	As a result, kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (Wyatt Julian, 2013), primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	In patients with IgA nephropathy, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy individuals, and elevated levels of BAFF are associated with histological severity of disease in kidney tissue.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	In IgA nephropathy, plasma cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Significant reductions in B-cell counts were observed in clinical studies of patients with lupus with blisibimod with concomitant decreases in proteinuria, serum immunoglobulins and autoantibodies, and increases in complement C3.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce B-cell proliferation, maturation, and survival, thereby reducing serum levels of IgA and targeting antibodies, and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	In June 2013, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study, ( BRIGHT-SC ) of patients with IgA nephropathy in Asia and Eastern Europe.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	The BRIGHT-SC study was a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	Enrollment criteria included biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram but less than six grams per 24 hours (1g-6g/24hr).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	Patients must have been receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S4	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study received 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S5	The BRIGHT-SC study enrolled 58 patients.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S6	In August 2017, we reported top line data from the completed extension of the BRIGHT-SC study in which all patients had the opportunity to complete at least 60 weeks of treatment and some patients were treated for up to two years.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S7	Throughout the treatment period and for up to one year of additional follow up off treatment, blisibimod appeared to halt disease progression as measured by the mean estimate of urinary protein:creatinine levels ("proteinuria").
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S8	Specifically, in patients treated with blisibimod, the mean change in proteinuria was stable to trending slightly downward, whereas the mean levels increased for patients in the placebo arm.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S9	m 2 with placebo as seen in the graph below.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P33_S10	Furthermore, serum immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgM, demonstrated marked reduction throughout the treatment period.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	According to our estimate, EPI is a disease that affects an estimated 130,000 patients in the United States.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The most common causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, the former a longstanding inflammation of the pancreas altering the organ's normal structure and function that can result from malnutrition, heredity, or (in the western world especially), behavior (alcohol use and smoking), and the latter a recessive hereditary disease most common in Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews where the molecular culprit is an altered, CFTR-encoded chloride channel.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	In children, another common cause is Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the SBDS gene.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	In the United States, IgA nephropathy is considered an orphan disease as it is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	In August 2017, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for blisibimod for the treatment of IgA. The prevalence of IgA nephropathy varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan and China), Australia, Finland and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulonephritis).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children and renal biopsies for patients with asymptomatic hematuria, and the reported prevalence of the disease is much higher.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P37_S4	For example, in Japan, IgA nephropathy is estimated to affect over 350,000 people annually.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	We completed technology transfer for pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) manufacturing and drug product manufacturing in 2016, and estimate that we will complete process validation for the fermentation and associated down-stream purification for all three enzyme APIs in 2019.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	In parallel, commercial scale capsule and sachet drug product manufacturing process validation is anticipated to be completed in 2019.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	The RESULT study protocol has been reviewed by the FDA prior to initiation.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	We believe that the design of RESULT provides adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of Sollpura to respond to the FDA s 2011 complete response letter.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	The RESULT study should also address the 2005 EMA protocol assistance comments, which were consistent with the FDA s request for an active comparator trial.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	We anticipate completing the Phase 3 clinical trials with Sollpura (the RESULT and SIMPLICITY studies) in 2018, and process validation for commercial manufacture of Sollpura APIs and drug product in 2019, with a target submission date of the Biologics Licence Application ( BLA ) in 2019.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	In September 2013, we met with the FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint under a Subpart E approval for blisibimod for treatment of IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA ) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	In this meeting we gained the PMDA s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod, and reached agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable, as well as the sufficiency of a single study to support a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application ( CMAA ) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study would be available post approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P41_S4	The EMA also recommended that the protocol provide information on the required duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Given the observed effects of blisibimod on proteinuria in patients with lupus, we are currently evaluating our options for investigating the effects of blisibimod in B-cell associated glomerulonephritides.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Sollpura was studied from 2002 to 2009 in seven clinical trials, in which a total of 492 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	Three Phase 1 trials were conducted, 1 in healthy volunteers and 2 in subjects with EPI due to CF.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	Two short-term trials, the Phase 2 Study TC-2A, and the Phase 3 Study 726 evaluated the efficacy of Sollpura in subjects 7 years of age with EPI due to CF.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P43_S3	Two long-term Phase 3 safety and tolerability trials were also conducted: Study 767 in subjects with EPI due to CF and Study 810 in subjects with EPI due to chronic pancreatitis/pancreatectomy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P43_S4	Completed clinical trials demonstrated that dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) absorption are significantly increased in patients with cystic fibrosis and EPI who received Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	In 2013, Eli Lilly gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a pivotal trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	The dose-ranging Phase 1 study TC-1B evaluated five dose levels across a 50-fold range, from 100-to-5000 lipase units (U) per kg per meal in CF-EPI subjects.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	In this study, greater improvements in nutrients absorption, as measured using the percent change from baseline in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and CNA, were observed at doses of 500 lipase U per kg per meal and higher.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Study TC-2A, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-finding trial, was conducted in 125 pediatric and adult subjects with CF-related EPI who were treated with Sollpura for 28 days in one of three dosing regimens containing 6,500 U, 32,500 U, and 130,000 U lipase administered per meal or snack.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	Observed mean CFAs at the end of study were 56.2%, 67.0%, and 69.7% in the 6,500, 32,500, and 130,000 U dose groups, respectively (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0032) with significant improvements in mean changes from baseline (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0005) and mean changes from baseline off-enzyme CFA to on treatment were 1.2%, 11.4% and 17.3%, respectively (1-way ANOVA p=0.0005).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	Pairwise comparison of the CFA values showed that statistically greater improvements were observed at the higher doses of Sollpura compared with the lowest dose of 6,500 U. Similar improvements in the CNA, were observed with Sollpura at the two highest dose levels.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Study 726, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, parallel design, multinational clinical, evaluated the effects of a single capsule of Sollpura (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) or placebo administered with every meal or snack in subjects with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Among the 138 subjects enrolled in this study, treatment with Sollpura resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in the CFA of 21.2% with Sollpura compared with 6.0% with placebo (p = 0.0011).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	The median body weight of subjects in this trial was 50 kg, for which the corresponding Sollpura dose was 650 U lipase/kg/meal or snack.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Two one-year studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and effects on nutritional status of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Study 810 evaluated adult subjects with EPI due to CP or after pancreatectomy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	Among the 214 subjects who were treated, an average dose of 5.5 capsules (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) of Sollpura per day maintained nutritional status as assessed by serial measurement of height and weight, including age-appropriate growth and weight gain in children.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	Mean BMI z-scores for subjects in Study 767 were maintained over time on study (mean BMI z-score at baseline, Months 3, 6, and 12 were -0.503, -0.637, -0.688, and -0.655, respectively).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	To date, five randomized, clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two Phase 1 dose-ranging studies by our licensor, Amgen; and two double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical outcomes studies, PEARL-SC (Phase 2b) and CHABLIS-SC1 (Phase 3), and a Phase 2 Open-Label Extension study (OLE) by the Company.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	All five clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	The PEARL-SC study was completed in June 2012 and the CHABLIS-SC1 study was completed in November 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	Both studies failed to meet the primary endpoints and we elected to stop further development of blisibimod for the treatment of lupus.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	In the CHABLIS-SC1 study, the primary endpoint compared the effects of blisibimod and placebo at Week 52 using the SLE Responder Index-6 (SRI-6): 6-point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, no new BILAG 1A or 2B domain scores, and 0.3-point increase in Physician s Global Assessment.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Compared with placebo, a higher proportion of subjects on blisibimod met the SRI-6 criteria from Week 16 through Week 52.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	However, this effect was not statistically significant at the primary endpoint analysis at Week 52.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	There was a statistically-significant steroid sparing effect among subjects randomized to blisibimod wherein 17.2% of subjects in the blisibimod group achieved corticosteroid dose of less than or equivalent to 7.5 mg prednisone compared with 8.9% in the control group (p=0.019).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	In subjects with baseline urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) 0.5 g/g, significantly higher proportions of blisibimod subjects achieved 50% reduction in UPCR, and/or UPCR 0.5 g/g. Reductions in SLE autoantibodies and B cells, and increases in complement C3 and C4 were observed with blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	We believe that these data support the further research with blisibimod patients with B-cell associated glomerulonephritides including IgA nephropathy, lupus with renal manifestations, and membranous glomerulonephritis.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	As a result of the outcomes of the CHABLIS-SC1 trial, at the end of 2016 we elected to discontinue the Phase 3 CHABLIS-7.5 study, which was initiated in June 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Since our inception in 2004, we have focused primarily on developing our product candidates, which currently include Sollpura for EPI and blisibimod for IgA nephropathy and potentially other glomerulonephritides.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we incurred $28.6 million, $46.5 million and $33.5 million, respectively, of research and development expense.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including enzyme replacement therapies and renal disease.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	We are advancing the development of Sollpura in a Phase 3 registration program in patients with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	If our Phase 3 clinical study is successful, we intend to commercialize Sollpura in the U.S. and seek strategic corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours to launch Sollpura outside of U.S.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	We have received orphan drug designation for blisibimod for the treatment of IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	We plan to opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for the development of blisibimod in renal disease and other B-cell associated glomerulonephritides.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our product candidates are focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as cystic fibrosis specialists and nephrologists.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our primary competitors who market PERTs approved in the U.S. or are developing PERTs in the U.S. are described in further detail below.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and licensed from third parties, to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	As of the date of this report, our Sollpura portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	One pending non-EP foreign patent application.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Eli Lilly to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in March 2025 and July 2028.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of Sollpura, one of these U.S. patents may be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S3	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S4	This could extend the expiration date of the selected U.S. Patent to as late as March 2030 or July 2033, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S5	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S6	The four exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire between February 2021 and October 2025.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P63_S7	One of these patents may be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to between February 2026 and October 2030.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	As of the date of this report, our blisibimod patent portfolio includes:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Four pending non-EP foreign patent applications in Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Poland.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Amgen to all of these patents and patent applications.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	In addition, we hold a non-exclusive worldwide license to one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, one pending EP patent application, and over 50 non-EP foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to general peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	The four exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022, March 2023 and November 2023.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	See Regulatory Matters Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to as late as May 2027, March 2028 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P68_S3	We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P68_S4	The exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P68_S5	One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P69_S3	As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	We are aware of two third-party issued U.S. patents that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of either of these issued U.S. patents in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P72_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P72_S4	If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and possibly requiring us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P72_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	In July 2014, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly (the Lilly Agreement ), to develop and commercialize Sollpura, a Phase 3 novel investigational PERT for the treatment of patients with EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we were not required to make any up-front payment but are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P73_S3	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009 and November 2014 (as amended, the Amgen Agreement ), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P74_S2	During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P74_S3	Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Agreement, we have paid $6.0 million in license fees to Amgen for blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States or European Union.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P75_S2	We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P75_S3	Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P75_S4	Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	In connection with a collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd ( Zenyaku ) for the development of IgA nephropathy that was executed in December 2014 and terminated in January 2016, we amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of our collaboration with Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by us to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	Under this amendment, we also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of our common stock equal to $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	We issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015 pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current GMP with oversight by our internal managers.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our contract manufacturers obtain the raw materials for the drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies from a variety of sources.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	We believe that this will provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials and drug product to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical systems, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by local, state and federal regulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	In order to commercialize our product candidates, we plan to develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P81_S3	In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidates alone.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P81_S4	We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in international markets.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidates to market.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support our products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either the new drug application, or NDA, process, or the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	Both of our drug candidates, Sollpura and blisibimod, are biologically manufactured and will go through the BLA process for approval if successful in Phase 3.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P84_S3	These sanctions could include the FDA s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P88_S2	An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P88_S3	The sponsor includes a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P89_S3	Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P90_S2	Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P90_S3	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P90_S4	The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P90_S5	Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P94_S1	These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	Safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 days after the sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator s brochure.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P95_S2	A sponsor also must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 days after the sponsor s receipt of the information.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P95_S3	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P95_S4	The FDA, a data safety monitoring board, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P95_S5	Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidates and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P96_S2	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration is required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no end-of-Phase 2 meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P99_S3	A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P101_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P101_S2	In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P101_S3	The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P102_S1	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP- compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P102_S2	The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P103_S1	The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P103_S2	The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P103_S3	An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P103_S4	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P104_S1	Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P104_S2	Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P104_S3	The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P104_S4	The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P104_S5	The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P104_S6	Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P105_S1	Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P105_S2	In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P106_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendment permits a patent term restoration of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P106_S2	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P106_S3	The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P106_S4	Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P106_S5	The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P106_S6	In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S1	A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S2	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S3	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S4	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S5	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S6	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P108_S7	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P109_S1	During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P109_S2	Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P110_S1	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P110_S2	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P111_S1	Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P111_S2	After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P111_S3	Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or by providing a major contribution to patient care, for seven years.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P112_S1	Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P112_S2	Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if any of our product candidates is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P112_S3	If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P113_S1	A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P114_S0	An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P114_S1	The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P115_S0	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P115_S1	Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P115_S2	For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P116_S0	A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P116_S1	A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P116_S2	The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P116_S3	Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P117_S0	Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well- controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P117_S1	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P117_S2	Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P118_S0	Sponsors may request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P119_S0	The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P119_S1	The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable, (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P120_S0	Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P121_S0	The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P121_S1	Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P121_S2	Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P121_S3	In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P122_S0	Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P122_S1	The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P122_S2	Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P123_S0	Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P123_S1	The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P124_S0	We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P124_S1	Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P125_S0	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P125_S1	Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P125_S2	Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P127_S1	It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P128_S1	Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P128_S2	The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P128_S3	The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P129_S1	European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P130_S0	Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P130_S1	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P130_S2	The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P131_S0	The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P131_S1	Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P131_S2	The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P131_S3	Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P131_S4	If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability and adequacy of third-party reimbursement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S1	Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including, at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S2	We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product although we cannot predict the level of reimbursement such third-party payors will provide for our products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S3	Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S4	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S5	We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S6	Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S7	It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P132_S8	Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P133_S0	In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P133_S1	For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, and mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal health care programs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P134_S0	Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P135_S1	Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for line extensions (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates owed by are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P135_S2	The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits (phased-in by 2014).
1316175_18_ITEM1_P135_S3	Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P136_S0	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P136_S1	Part D prescription drug plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P136_S2	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P136_S3	Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P136_S4	While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P136_S5	However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P136_S6	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P137_S0	Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P137_S1	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P137_S2	Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P137_S3	Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P138_S0	For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P138_S1	The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P138_S2	As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P138_S3	As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P139_S0	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P139_S1	The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P139_S2	Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P139_S3	It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P139_S4	If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P140_S0	In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P141_S0	The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P141_S1	A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation s automatic reduction to several government programs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P141_S2	These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P143_S0	The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P143_S1	In addition, effective January 1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P144_S0	These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P145_S0	As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P145_S1	We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P145_S2	Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P145_S3	Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P146_S0	There are also laws that govern a company s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P146_S1	For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company s ability to operate its business.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P147_S0	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P147_S1	We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P147_S2	Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P147_S3	At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P147_S4	However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P147_S5	While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P148_S0	Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P149_S0	While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P150_S0	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P151_S0	The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P151_S1	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P151_S2	A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P151_S3	In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P151_S4	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P151_S5	There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P152_S0	For our product and any product candidates which may obtain regulatory approval and are marketed in the United States, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers, and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P152_S1	In addition, we may be subject to health information privacy and security regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P152_S2	In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:
1316175_18_ITEM1_P153_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party on its behalf) to, knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, receive, or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual for or the purchase or recommendation of an item or for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P153_S1	Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P154_S0	The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P154_S1	Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and the potential implication of various federal criminal statutes.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P155_S0	The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P156_S0	Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P157_S0	Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P158_S0	Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P159_S0	HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ( HITECH ), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates, relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P159_S1	HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damage or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P160_S0	The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P161_S0	Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P161_S1	Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P161_S2	Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P161_S3	State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P161_S4	Such data privacy and security laws may differ from one another in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P162_S0	The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P163_S0	Federal and state enforcement bodies have scrutinized interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P163_S1	It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P163_S2	If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement ,exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P163_S3	If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P163_S4	Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company s attention from the business.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P164_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had 21 employees.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P164_S1	All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory and business development functions.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P164_S2	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P165_S0	We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P165_S1	Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P165_S2	In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P166_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware in 2004.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P166_S1	The mailing address of our headquarters is 25801 Industrial Blvd, Suite B, Hayward, CA 94545, and our telephone number at that location is 510-856-5600.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P167_S0	Through a link on the Investors section of our website (under SEC Filings in the Financial Information section), we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; Current Reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_18_ITEM1_P167_S1	Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with two assets in the clinical stage of development.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2004.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $434.4 million.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Substantially all our losses resulted from costs incurred with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidates into clinical studies and as we:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	hire additional clinical, scientific and management personnel, if needed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	the acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have never generated any product revenue and may never be profitable.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct clinical studies in patients, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize any approved products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	However, as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod, we began recognizing license fee revenue and collaborative revenue in 2015.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The license fee revenue from the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku was initially amortized as revenue over the performance obligation period (product development period) while reimbursement for our full-time employees ( FTEs ) was recorded as collaborative revenues as incurred.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The termination was at will and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Because of an early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement, we did not recognize revenues under the Zenyaku Agreement beyond January 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The commercial success of our development-stage product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to :
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our product candidates have failed in clinical studies because we were unable to demonstrate that they were effective.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Furthermore, our products candidates could fail if they cause unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Failure of our product candidates in clinical studies will have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2017, together with the net proceeds of $11.1 million from the second closing of a private placement of our equity securities and $3.1 million from warrant exercises and sale of common stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement subsequent to December 31, 2017 will not be sufficient to fund our operations for next twelve months from the filing of this report, which results in substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	terminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for sale.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of this report is not alleviated after consideration of management s plans to mitigate such concerns.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose their entire investment.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In order for us to continue as a going concern beyond our current projected cash runway of the second quarter of 2018, we will be required to obtain capital from external sources, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities, if convertible, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Furthermore, we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We plan to meet our capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, potential partnerships, debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We may be forced to obtain funds through collaborations with potential collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialized independently.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our intended business objectives.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	revenues received from approved products, if any, in the future.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to our licensors is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In December 2007, we entered into the Amgen Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low teens as net sales increase.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In July 2014, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Pursuant to the Lilly Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives for any Sollpura formulation.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We are also required to make tiered royalty payments on net sales, which percentage increases from the high single digits to the mid-teens as net sales increase.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ( CFFT ) for the development of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Under the research award agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the five times the award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to our licensors is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of our product candidates, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We depend substantially on the success of our product candidates which are still under clinical development.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	To date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well- controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidates are safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until the FDA approves our biologics license applications, or BLAs, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have not submitted any BLA or received marketing approval for our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	The FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	From time to time during the regulatory approval process of our product candidates, we engage in discussions with the FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may receive informal verbal and or written guidance from these authority agencies which may help form the basis of our clinical trial designs.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The FDA and other non-US regulatory agencies may change their position on such informal guidance prior to the approval of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	As a result, we are unable to determine whether the outcome of informal deliberations will become final.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with inquiries and requests from the FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value maybe be reduced.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospect.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	retaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Clinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, at any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Product development costs to us will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidates or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delays outside our control.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical development plans or clinical study protocols to reflect these changes.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Because the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidates, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Even if we believe that our product candidates have performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain FDA or other regulatory authority approval for our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	If we breach the license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are party to the Amgen Agreement, which provides for the exclusive worldwide licenses of the compositions of matter and methods of use for blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive worldwide licenses of compositions of matter and methods of use relating to peptibodies generally.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We are also party to the Lilly Agreement, which provides for an exclusive worldwide license of the compositions of matter, formulation, and methods of use patents for Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These agreements require us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify our licensors under the terms of the agreements.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors may terminate our licenses and may be able to re-obtain licensed technologies and aspects of any intellectual properties controlled by us that relate to the licensed technologies that originated from our licensors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of the licensed product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreements.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents and patent applications licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Any uncured, material breach under the license agreements could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competition.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The market for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is also highly competitive.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis in the U.S., including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Zenpep and Viokace by Allergan, and Pertzye by Chiesi.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Biopharma s MS1819 lipase is currently being tested in a Phase 2 trial in patients with chronic pancreatitis; and Alcresta Therapeutics markets RELiZORB, a lipase enzyme cartridge designed for use by adults receiving nutrition by enteral tube who have trouble digesting and absorbing ingested fats.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, and in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidates we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Undesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Sollpura, which we licensed from Eli Lilly in July 2014, received a complete response letter ( CRL ) from the FDA while it was under development by Eli Lilly in April 2011.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Eli Lilly has attempted to address the material items highlighted by the FDA in the CRL and worked directly with the FDA on a clinical development program for Sollpura which, if successful, could result in regulatory approval of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	There are still open items from the CRL that we will need to address with the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	While we plan to make reasonable efforts to accommodate and address the FDA s inquiries and requests, we are unable to determine the final outcome of the CRL.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Any delay in addressing the CRL to the satisfaction of the FDA may result in postponement of our Phase 3 clinical trial of Sollpura in patients with EPI.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If serious adverse events related to our product candidates are observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Further, if our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market approval and acceptance of the affected product candidates and could substantially increase the costs of commercialization.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	After the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from the product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Even if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize any product candidate until the clinical and drug manufacturing data have been generated and submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities, and they have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidate.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we develop.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and FDA regulatory review.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	For example, the label ultimately approved for blisibimod or Sollpura, if any, may include restrictions on use.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Further, the FDA has indicated that long-term safety data on blisibimod may need to be obtained as a post-market requirement.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P60_S4	In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P60_S5	If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with our product candidates, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the products are manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the products, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the products from the market or suspension of manufacturing.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P60_S6	If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from their sales, if any, will be limited.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The degree of market acceptance of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third- party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The use of product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	decreased demand for product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	If and when we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P73_S3	While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P76_S4	If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P76_S5	In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P76_S6	For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates or market them.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce drug product for our clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	There are a small number of suppliers, and in some instances, a single supplier for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture drug product.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials and equipment to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P80_S3	We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials and equipment by our manufacturers.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P80_S5	Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of product candidates to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of product candidates or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P80_S6	If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained, the commercial launch would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of such product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If we successfully commercialize a product candidate, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P81_S3	We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, which may not occur on a timely basis.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Some of our manufacturing suppliers are located overseas, and the transportation of drug supplies to or from these facilities to their intended destinations is subject to certain risks of loss and damage beyond our control.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Additionally, the importation of drug supplies into and from foreign countries is subject to customs regulations that may require us to incur additional regulatory costs.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Any delays in the development and validation of drug manufacturing processes for commercialization could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospect.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Delays in the commencement or completion of drug manufacturing could significantly affect our readiness to commercialize our drug products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We do not know whether planned manufacturing processes will be successful or be completed on schedule.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P84_S2	The development and validation of drug manufacturing processes can be delayed for numerous reasons, including delays related to:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	uncontrollable natural forces that may render the CMO temporarily or permanently incapable of manufacturing our drugs.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Drug manufacturing may also be delayed, suspended or changed as a result of advice from regulatory authorities such as the FDA or other international regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	inspection of the CMO by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a manufacturing hold.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend our manufacturing plans or processes to reflect these changes.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Amendments to the processes may impact the costs, timing or successful completion development and validation of the drug manufacturing processes for commercialization.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, product commercialization may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Also, if product commercialization is delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P90_S3	We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	G uidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Government agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P92_S2	These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Recently enacted and future legislation or regulatory requirements or reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	New federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	New legislation and additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidates, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	For example, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P96_S2	The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Since its enactment, however, there have been modifications and challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court heard challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the viability of certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	The Supreme Court s decision upheld most of the Healthcare Reform Act and determined that requiring individuals to maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service was within Congress s constitutional taxing authority.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P99_S2	However, as a result of tax reform legislation passed in late December 2017, the individual mandate has been eliminated.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P99_S3	The long ranging effects of the elimination of the individual mandate on the viability of the ACA are unknown at this time.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	In 2018, litigation, regulation, and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	replacing, and/or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted that, directly or indirectly, affect or are likely to affect, the pharmaceutical industry and the commercialization of our products, including: the Budget Control Act of 2011; the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012; the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act ( MMA and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P105_S1	We expect that any of these, as well as any healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Individual U.S. state governments have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S1	We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S2	The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S3	It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S4	Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third- party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S5	Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, attempts to repeal, replace, or modify the ACA, additional prescription drug coverage legislation, and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S6	In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P108_S7	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	In some foreign countries, including major markets in the EU and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P109_S1	In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P110_S2	Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We are subject to healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Healthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product candidates, if approved.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	Our future arrangements with third-party payors will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if we obtain marketing approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P112_S2	In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	The federal false claims laws impose criminal and civil penalties, including those from civil whistleblower or qui tam actions pursuant to the federal False Claims Act, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	The federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Ensuring that our future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P121_S1	It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P121_S2	If our operations, including anticipated activities to be conducted by our sales team, were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P121_S3	If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S0	We are highly dependent on Mr. Craig Thompson, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. William R. Shanahan, our Chief Medical Officer, Ms. May Liu, our Chief Accounting Officer, Dr. Renee Martin, our Senior Vice President, Medical Sciences, and the other principal members of our executive team.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S1	The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S2	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S4	We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S5	Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S6	In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P123_S7	Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P124_S0	We are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P126_S1	We are a target of this type of litigation.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P126_S2	cv-715, on behalf of a putative class of the Company s stockholders against the Company and certain of its current and former officers that was voluntarily dismissed, as discussed in Item 3.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P126_S3	Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P126_S4	Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile, which could result in the decline of the value of your investment in our common stock or class action litigation against us and our management, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P128_S0	The market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P128_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P129_S0	discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Although our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P130_S1	Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P130_S2	Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P130_S3	Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P130_S4	In addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Capital Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P130_S5	These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P131_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P131_S1	Securities litigation against us, including as discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention and resources and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Future sales of our common stock by the selling stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P134_S0	As of February 28, 2018, there were 23,397,497 shares of our common stock outstanding.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P134_S1	In addition, we had outstanding 2,067,522 shares of Class Y Convertible Preferred Stock that are convertible into 2,067,522 shares of common stock, and options and warrants to purchase 26,520,407 shares of our common stock that, if converted and exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P135_S0	A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Sales by these stockholders or option holders in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P137_S0	We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P138_S0	We will need to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P138_S1	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P139_S1	If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Operating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P141_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P141_S1	In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P141_S2	For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Capital Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P141_S3	We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P142_S0	In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P142_S1	We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P142_S2	Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P142_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The Nasdaq Capital Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P143_S0	We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P144_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P144_S1	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P144_S2	Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P146_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P147_S0	the requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P148_S0	In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P148_S1	Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P148_S2	In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P150_S1	An ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P150_S2	We underwent ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 ownership of the Internal Revenue Code during 2012 and in January 2018, as such, our net operating loss carryforwards are limited.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P150_S3	In addition, the pre-change R D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P150_S4	If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will result in increased future tax liability to us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P151_S0	We may be unable to issue securities under our shelf registration statement, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P152_S0	We have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P152_S1	The registration statement is subject to Instruction I.B.6.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P152_S2	of Form S-3, which imposes a limitation on the maximum amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to the registration statement during any twelve-month period.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P152_S3	When we sell securities pursuant to the registration statement, the amount of securities to be sold plus the amount of any securities we have sold during the prior twelve months in reliance on Instruction I.B.6.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P152_S4	may not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days immediately preceding such sale, as computed in accordance with Instruction I.B.6.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P152_S5	Based on this calculation and the current market value of our outstanding common stock, we expect that we will be significantly limited to selling additional securities pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-3, unless and until the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates increases significantly.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P152_S6	If we cannot sell securities under our shelf registration, we may be required to utilize more costly and time-consuming means of accessing the capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and cash position.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P153_S0	If our or our licensors patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidates or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P154_S0	We hold license rights to U.S. numerous European ( EP ), and non-EP foreign patents and patent applications relating to blisibimod and Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P154_S1	Our Sollpura portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P154_S2	Our blisibimod portfolio is made up of exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen, as well as U.S. and Patent Cooperation Treaty ( PCT ) patent applications owned by us.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the United States and other countries.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P155_S1	If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P156_S0	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P157_S0	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P158_S1	We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P159_S0	The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P160_S0	the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P161_S0	We are aware of two third-party issued United States patents that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P161_S2	If we were to challenge the validity of either of these issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent s claims.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P161_S3	There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P161_S4	If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P161_S5	Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P162_S0	We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P163_S0	We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P163_S1	However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P163_S2	We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P163_S3	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P163_S4	In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P163_S5	Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P163_S6	Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P164_S0	We license patent rights from third-party owners.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P164_S1	If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P165_S0	We are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the novel BAFF inhibitor blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P165_S1	We are also a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Sollpura, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to Sollpura compositions and formulations.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P166_S0	We depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering blisibimod and Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P166_S1	Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P166_S2	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P166_S3	Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P166_S4	We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P166_S5	Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P166_S6	We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P167_S0	Our success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P167_S1	We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P167_S2	Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P167_S3	Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P168_S0	If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and/or we do not obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P169_S0	The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendment provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in clinical testing and the regulatory approval process.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P169_S1	If the USPTO grants a five-year patent term extension for Sollpura and for blisibimod and if we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to both, our exclusive rights to one of Sollpura s U.S. composition of matter patents could extend until 2030 or 2033 and our exclusive rights to one of blisibimod s U.S. composition of matter patents could extend until 2027 or 2028.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P170_S0	In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P170_S1	If each European country where we seek such grants a five-year extension for Sollpura and for blisibimod and if we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to both, our exclusive rights to Sollpura s European composition of matter patents could extend until 2026 or 2030, and our exclusive rights to blisibimod s European composition of matter patents could extend until 2027 in those European countries.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P171_S0	However, we may not be granted an extension in a particular country if we, for example, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P171_S1	Moreover, the applicable time period of the extension or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P171_S2	If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration of the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors, including manufacturers of generic alternatives, may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P172_S0	Further, since neither Sollpura nor blisibimod have been previously approved in the U.S., both may be eligible for 12 years of biologic data exclusivity from the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P172_S1	During this data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P173_S0	Similarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European composition of matter patent covering such biologic expires.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P173_S1	A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P174_S0	The law governing biologic data exclusivity in the U.S. is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P174_S1	As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P174_S2	While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for Sollpura or blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P174_S3	For example, there is a risk that the 12-year period of exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider Sollpura or blisibimod to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P174_S4	Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for Sollpura or blisibimod in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P175_S0	There is no assurance that we will receive extensions for our patents available under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment or similar foreign legislation, or that we will receive data exclusivity or other exclusive marketing rights.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P175_S1	If we fail to receive such extensions or exclusivities or if we receive extensions or exclusivity periods that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling biosimilars of our products will be materially harmed.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P176_S0	Our current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P176_S1	We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P177_S0	We typically develop product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds production and use to the extent known at that time.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P177_S1	As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P177_S2	We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P178_S0	Although our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P178_S1	We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P178_S2	For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P179_S0	U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P179_S1	Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P179_S2	Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P179_S3	If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P180_S0	We may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P180_S1	Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P181_S0	Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P182_S0	Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P182_S1	If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P183_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidates and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P183_S1	Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P183_S2	Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P183_S3	Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors existing or future patents.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P184_S0	Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P185_S0	Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P185_S1	If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P186_S0	Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P186_S1	We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.
1316175_18_ITEM1A_P186_S2	In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.
1316175_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our main operating facility in Hayward, California.
1316175_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	We occupy approximately 8,000 square feet under a facility sublease agreement that expires in August 2019.
1316175_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe our existing facility is adequate for our current needs and that any additional space we need will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not subject to any material pending legal proceedings.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	From time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the normal course of our business.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	For example, on February 13, 2017, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California captioned Brian Clevlen v. Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:17-cv-715, on behalf of a putative class of the Company s stockholders against the Company and certain of its current and former officers.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	The complaint asserts claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased the Company s common stock between February 10, 2015 and December 27, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P0_S4	The complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements and/or omissions with respect to the CHABLIS-SC1 trial and SOLUTION study.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P0_S5	The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys fees, costs, and such other relief at the Court may deem just and proper.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	On April 17, 2017, Ure omir orak, a putative stockholder of the Company, filed a motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff, and to have the law firm of Levi Korsinsky LLP appointed as lead counsel in the action.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	Also on April 17, 2017, a group of putative stockholders of the Company, comprised of Kent Roberts, Kent Roberts FBO Evan Roberts, Kent Roberts Parent FBO Owen Roberts, and Bobby King, filed a motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff, to have the law firm of Lifschitz Miller LLP appointed as lead counsel, and to have the law firm of Reich Radcliffe Hoover LLP appointed as liaison counsel in the action.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	On May 18, 2017, the Court appointed Ure omir orak as lead plaintiff, and Levi Korsinsky LLP as lead counsel in the action.
1316175_18_ITEM3_P1_S3	On July 17, 2017, lead plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the action without prejudice .
1316175_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	As of the date of this report, we believe there is no litigation pending that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock was listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ANTH from our initial public offering ( IPO ) until January 26, 2018.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Since January 26, 2018, the Company has been listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ANTH .
1316175_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	Prior to the IPO, there was no public market for our common stock.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Market:
1316175_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2017, an aggregate of 13,854,491 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were held by 55 registered holders, based on information provided by the Company s transfer agent.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	A significantly larger number of stockholders may be "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P4_S2	Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P4_S3	Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Part III, Item 12 of this report.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not issue or sell any unregistered securities not previously disclosed in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
1316175_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	We did not repurchase any securities during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables reflect selected consolidated summary financial data for each of the last five fiscal years and are derived from our audited financial statements.
1316175_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	This data should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1316175_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from CFFT for our development of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	The research award was receivable by the Company upon the achievement of certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM6_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2017 the entire award has been received and recognized as a component of Operating Expenses in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
1316175_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is identical to basic EPS since common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
1316175_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	Weighted average shares used in net loss per basic and diluted share have been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split effectuated by the Company on April 28, 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	We currently have two compounds in development, Sollpura and blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	We licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly Co ( Eli Lilly ) in July 2014.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( PERT ) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency ( EPI ), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. ( Amgen ) in December 2007.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy and others.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We were incorporated in September 2004.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have devoted substantially all our resources to research and development of our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates, and since inception we have funded our operations through equity offerings, private placements of convertible debt, debt financing, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a former collaborative partner, Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd ( Zenyaku ), and a research award from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated ("CFFT").
1316175_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	We will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P8_S5	In addition to the normal risks associated with drug development companies, we may never successfully complete development of our product candidates, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P8_S6	In addition, we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing our product candidates .
1316175_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	In March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from CFFT for our development of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We retain the right to develop and commercialize Sollpura and will owe royalties to CFFT on net sales of any drug candidate approved and commercialized under the collaboration.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	The funding is to be disbursed by CFFT to us upon our achievement of milestones specified in the agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	At our discretion, we may choose to fund a particular stage of the Sollpura development plan without CFFT funds.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	Any CFFT funds not expended on the development program of Sollpura must be returned to CFFT and, upon such return, the amounts of such returned funds will not be included as part of the research award for the purpose of calculating royalties or other amounts owed by us to CFFT.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	To the extent CFFT provides or makes available any information, expertise, know-how or other intellectual property related to cystic fibrosis or the treatment, prevention or cure thereof ( CFFT Know-How ) to us, CFFT grants to us a non-exclusive, transferrable, sub licensable, worldwide rights and license under all of CFFT s rights in such CFFT Know-How to assist us to research, develop, commercialize, make or have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import, export and otherwise exploit the product .
1316175_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	In May 2017, we initiated a Phase 3 study of Sollpura ("RESULT") in patients with EPI due to cystic fibrosis.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The RESULT study is a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the non-inferiority of Sollpura with respect to Coefficient of Fat Absorption ( CFA ) compared to a commercially available PERT in a population of porcine-derived PERT responders.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	The RESULT study s design is modified from a previous Phase 3 study s ( SOLUTION ) design to incorporate learnings from that study by 1) starting Sollpura dosing at 125% of the pre-study PERT dose, 2) allowing for a more real life dose adjustment, as needed, based on signs and symptoms throughout the first three weeks of the primary treatment phase of the study, and 3) providing a shorter primary treatment duration of 4 weeks, with 3 weeks of dose optimization and 1 week of stable dosing before measuring CFA.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Patients are then followed in a 20-week extension period for the collection of longer term safety and efficacy (e.g., growth, maintenance of body weight) data.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	The RESULT study design was discussed with the FDA prior to initiation.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Furthermore, the study had been approved by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network ( CFFTDN ) Protocol Review Committee, and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trial Network Executive Committee.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The RESULT study enrolled 140 patients in North America, Eastern and Western Europe and Israel.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	In December 2017 and January 2018, pre-specified interim futility analyses of the RESULT study were conducted by a Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) comprised of experts appointed by the CFFTDN when approximately 25% and 50% of patients had completed the 4-week primary treatment period; in each instance, the committee recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	A second, smaller Phase 3 study ( SIMPLICITY ) aimed at expanding the treatment age of patients to include patients age from 28 days to seven years old, and potentially enabling marketing approval for the sachet presentation of Sollpura, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The SIMPLICITY study utilizes sachets containing Sollpura powder for oral solution.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	The study is designed in two parts (Part A and Part B).
1316175_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Part A which evaluated the safety and general usability of Sollpura powder for oral solution in 15 patients 7 years of age, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	On December 9, 2016, an independent Data Monitoring Committee evaluated the data from Part A and approved progression to Part B, which will enroll pediatric subjects below 7 years of age.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	Assuming the RESULT study is successful, before we proceed with Part B, we plan to amend the SIMPLICITY study to follow a similar dosing approach as the RESULT study and initiate enrollment in Part B in the second quarter of 2018.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Furthermore, during the third quarter of 2016, we initiated the EASY study, which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients in the Sollpura arm who completed the SOLUTION study.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	We have amended this study to also allow Sollpura-assigned patients completing the RESULT study at a lipase dose greater than 10,000 units/kg/day to have continued access until the Biological License Application ( BLA ) for Sollpura is approved by the FDA.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Lastly, prior to the RESULT study, we conducted another Phase 3 study ( SOLUTION ) in patients with EPI.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The SOLUTION study was also a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	This pivotal study enrolled 128 patients in North America, Europe and Israel.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	Top line data announced in December 2016 showed that the study narrowly missed the CFA non-inferiority margin of the primary mITT analysis by one percent; however, by additional pre-specified analyses of CFA (mITT-Baseline Observation Carried Forward and Per Protocol), Sollpura met the non-inferiority criterion.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	The study also demonstrated that the ratio of the three enzymes in Sollpura provided an appropriate response in CNA.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P16_S5	In March 2017, we announced data from the extension phase of the study, which showed that Sollpura demonstrated comparable maintenance in key measurements of height, weight, and body mass index in addition to being well tolerated throughout the 12-week extension period.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	We believe our Sollpura studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed porcine-derived PERTs, including:
1316175_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	a sachet formulation containing Sollpura powder for oral solution which can be easily dissolved into water, finally providing patients, especially young pediatric patients, with an easy-to-swallow dosing option.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	In June 2013, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study, ( BRIGHT-SC ) of patients with IgA nephropathy in Asia and Eastern Europe.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The BRIGHT-SC study was a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Enrollment criteria included biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram but less than six grams per 24 hours (1g-6g/24hr).
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	Patients must have been receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study received 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S5	The BRIGHT-SC study enrolled 58 patients.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S6	In August 2017, we reported top line data from the completed extension of the BRIGHT-SC study in which all patients had the opportunity to complete at least 60 weeks of treatment and some patients were treated for up to two years.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S7	Throughout the treatment period and for up to one year of additional follow up off treatment, blisibimod appeared to halt disease progression as measured by the mean estimate of urinary protein:creatinine levels ("proteinuria").
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S8	Specifically, in patients treated with blisibimod, the mean change in proteinuria was stable to trending slightly downward, whereas the mean levels increased for patients in the placebo arm.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S9	m 2 with placebo as seen in the graph below.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P19_S10	Furthermore, serum immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgM, demonstrated marked reduction throughout the treatment period.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	However, because of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod, we began recognizing license fee revenue and collaborative revenue in 2015.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The license fee from the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku was initially amortized as revenue over the performance obligation period (product development period) while reimbursement for our FTEs was recorded as collaborative revenues as incurred.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	In September 2015, we received a termination notice from Zenyaku to terminate the collaborative arrangement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	Consequently, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period and have fully amortized our deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Since our inception, we have focused our activities on our product candidates development programs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, or CROs, manufacturing and distribution of clinical drugs, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities-related costs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	Clinical study expenses are separated into two main categories: clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P21_S4	Historically, our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P21_S5	We expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for the continued development of blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P21_S6	Pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We are developing our product candidates in parallel, and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Thus, some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	These unallocated costs include salaries, stock-based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), consulting fees and travel.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following table shows our total research and development expenses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, Blisibimod expense included reimbursed development costs totaling $1.5 million pursuant to the Zenyaku agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development and manufacturing activities.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion, including :
1316175_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	manufacturing challenges including costs of raw materials, purchase and maintenance of equipment, and costs associated with measurement of drug quality.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	None of our product candidates has received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	In order to grant marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical studies, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate, if ever.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in general and administrative functions, including executive, finance and business development.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Other significant costs include professional fees for legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, and costs associated with operating as a public company.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	We will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company, including costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, payment to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We account for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our equity incentive plans under the provisions of ASC 718 which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	This model requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized ratably over the requisite service period of the award.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Due to the limited amount of historical data available to us, particularly with respect to stock-price volatility, employee exercise patterns and forfeitures, actual results could differ from our assumptions.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company has issued certain financial instruments, including warrants to purchase common stock, which have characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Financial instruments such as warrants that are classified as liabilities are fair valued upon issuance and are re-measured at fair value at subsequent reporting periods with the resulting change in fair value recorded in other income/(expense).
1316175_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The fair value of warrants is estimated using valuation models that require the input of subjective assumptions including stock price volatility, expected life, and the probability of future stock combination events and their impact to the exercise price .
1316175_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	We make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	The majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and adjust if necessary.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	Examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include :
1316175_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our expenses related to clinical studies and manufacturing are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with many research institutions, clinical research organizations, contract manufacture organizations, and other service providers.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	Payments under the contracts are mainly driven by time and materials incurred by these service providers.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	Expenses related to clinical studies and manufacturing activities are accrued based on time and materials incurred by the service providers and in accordance with the contracts.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P40_S5	If timelines or contracts are modified based on scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	We began to recognize revenue in 2015 from the collaborative arrangement we entered into with a collaborative partner in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	In January 2016, we recorded total revenue of $0.1 million for the amortization of the license fee revenue and for the reimbursement of FTEs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	This collaborative arrangement was terminated effective January 7, 2016 and no collaborative revenue has been recognized subsequent to the termination .
1316175_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Research and development expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 from 2016 primarily due to lower clinical development expenses as a result of the SOLUTION and CHABLIS studies being substantially complete in 2016 and the SIMPLICITY study being on hold since 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	The BRIGHT and CHABLIS 7.5 studies were completed during 2017 and the RESULT study in cystic fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency study was initiated in 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	The change in clinical development activities result in reductions in expenses by $16.2 million.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	General and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 from 2016 primarily due to an approximately one-third reduction in administrative headcount implemented in January 2017, which lowered payroll and stock-based compensation expense by $3.4 million.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following table summarizes our research award for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Research award decreased in the year ended December 31, 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the timing of achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We have fully recognized the research award in 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Other income (expense) recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017 is comprised of mainly a $10.2 million change in fair value of warrant liability associated with a direct offering of our common stock and warrants in March 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The initial fair value of the liability associated with the warrants was $14.7 million.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	The fair value decreased to $4.5 million as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of the common stock underlying the warrant shares.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	The decrease of $10.2 million is recognized as part of non-operating income in the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1316175_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $1.7 million for changes in the fair value of warrant liability associated with a direct offering of preferred stock and warrants that we executed in September 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	The exercise price and number of warrant shares were not known on the date issuance.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	As such, we estimated an initial fair value of $3.7 million for the warrant liability with certain assumptions.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	In November 2016, the exercise price and number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants became fixed.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	The Company re-measured the fair value of the warrants and derived a fair value of $1.9 million.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	The decrease of $1.7 million was recognized as part of non-operating income in the year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the termination of a collaborative partnership with Zenyaku.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	We began to recognize revenues in 2015 as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $2.6 million for the amortization of the license fee and $0.6 million for the reimbursement of FTEs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	License fee from the collaborative arrangement was amortized over the period of performance (product development period) while reimbursement for our FTEs was recorded as collaborative revenue.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	In September 2015, we received a termination notice from Zenyaku to terminate the collaborative arrangement, effective January 7, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P53_S5	Consequently, we revised the amortization period of our deferred revenue to correspond with the shortened collaboration period and fully amortized the deferred revenue as of January 7, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Research and development expenses increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to costs associated with acceleration of the manufacturing scale-up timeline, including the production of demonstration and registration batches at commercial launch scale for Sollpura .
1316175_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Additionally, clinical development expense also increased from prior year due to the initiation of three new clinical studies, namely the CHABLIS-7.5 study with blisibimod in severe lupus patients, the SIMPLICITY study with Sollpura in sachet formulation and the EASY study which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients who rolled off the SOLUTION clinical study.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	General and administrative expenses increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2016 as a result of options issued in 2016 and higher expense related to professional services to support the growth of the Company.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following table summarizes our research award for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Research award decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to the timing of achieving certain milestones specified in the award agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	We achieved a majority of the milestones in 2015 and as a result we recognized $2.6 million out of total of $3.0 million in research award from CFFT for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Other income (expense) recorded in 2016 included change in fair value of warrant liability, interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the net impact of realized gain or loss from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	In connection with the subscription agreement for the sale of convertible preferred stock entered in September 2016, we issued common stock warrants to certain institutional investors.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The initial fair value of the liability associated with these warrants was $3.7 million, and the fair value decreased to $1.9 million when the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants became fixed in November 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	The changes in the fair value of the warrants is recognized in the statement of operations in the year ended December 31, 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Other income (expense) recorded in 2015 was mainly a result of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the net impact of realized gain or loss from foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and common stock, convertible debt, debt financings and public offerings of common stock, equity investment and cost reimbursement from a collaborative partner, and a research award from CFFT.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.2 million.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	In January 2018, we completed the second closing of a private placement that was executed in October 2017 for net proceeds of $11.1 million.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	In February 2018, we received net proceeds of $3.1 million from warrant exercises and sale of common stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, and our capital expenditure needs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	In March 2016, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $100.0 million of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Between April 2016 and February 2018, we issued $3.3 million of our common stock (including shares issued for commitment fee) pursuant to equity purchase agreements with Lincoln Park Capital under the registration statement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	In September 2016, we sold $22.1 million of our preferred stock to institutional investors in a registered direct offering.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	In March 2017 we sold $15.0 million of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate exercise price of $31.5 million.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	After completion of these offerings, up to a maximum offering price of $17.4 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units remain available under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Pursuant to Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3, we may not sell more than the equivalent of one-third of our public float during any 12 consecutive months so long as our public float is less than $75 million, which will limit our ability to raise funds using our shelf registration statement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	We will need substantial additional financing to continue the development of our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals, and prepare for commercial readiness if our clinical trials are successful.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	We believe our current capital is only sufficient to fund our operating plan through the second quarter of 2018.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	We currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	Any such financing could be difficult to obtain on favorable terms or at all, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of this report and that is not alleviated after consideration of management s plans to mitigate such concerns.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S4	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S5	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay our development programs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S6	This would include, amongst other things, eliminating or reducing the scope of one more of our clinical trials, delaying BLA submission for Sollpura, delaying manufacturing activities, and reducing headcount.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S7	Even if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms and, in such event, the market price of our common stock may decline and further dilution to our existing stockholders will result.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P68_S8	In addition, the expectation of future dilution as a result of our offering of securities convertible into equity securities may cause our stock price to decline.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, our operating activities used cash of $36.9 million, compared to $48.9 million in 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	The decrease in cash used for operating activities in 2017 was mainly attributable to lower research and development expense due to the completion of our Phase 3 CHABLIS-SC1 clinical study by the end of 2016 and discontinuation of our Phase 3 CHABLIS-7.5 in early 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The CHABLIS studies enrolled more than 400 patients with systemic lupus erythematous ( SLE ) across multiple geographies in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, no cash was used in investing activities, compared to $0.8 million in 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Cash used in investing activities was higher in 2016 mainly due to the purchase of capital equipment to support the manufacturing activities for the development of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $18.3 million, compared to $23.6 million in 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	Proceeds raised in 2017 are comprised of mainly $14.1 million from the sale of our common stock through a direct offering in March, $2.2 million from the first closing of a private placement of our securities in October and $1.8 million from the sale of common stock pursuant the 2017 Equity Purchase Agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	Proceeds raised in 2016 are comprised of mainly $16.8 million from the sale of preferred stock and warrants, and net proceeds of $6.4 million from the sale of common stock pursuant the 2015 Equity Purchase Agreement and the H.C. Wainwright ATM Agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following (in thousands):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our operating activities used cash of $48.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	The increase in cash used for operating activities in 2016 was mainly attributable to higher research and development expense due to costs associated with acceleration of the manufacturing scale-up timeline, the purchase and installation of manufacturing equipment at our contract manufacturers, and the initiation of three new clinical studies in 2016.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in investment activities was $0.8 million, which was primarily driven by the purchase of capital equipment to support the manufacturing activities for the development of Sollpura.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in investing activities was immaterial.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $23.6 million, which was driven by net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement, sale of common stock pursuant to at-the-market ( ATM ) sales agreements, and sale of preferred stock and warrants to purchase our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $75.3 million, which was driven by net proceeds of $12.1 million received from the sale of our common stock through an ATM program, $53.9 million received from the sale of our common stock through two public offerings, and $9.0 million from the sale of our common stock at a 30% premium to a collaborative partner.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have lease obligations consisting of two operating leases for our operating facilities that expire in May and July 2019, respectively.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The following table summarizes our estimated scheduled future minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):
1316175_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	In February 2018, the Company early terminated the lease agreement for its Pleasanton office and reduced its future lease payment by approximately $42,000.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidates in development, as these payments are not determinable.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Under the Amgen Agreement, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	We are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable on a country-by-country basis and licensed on a product-by-licensed-product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicensee in such country, or (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Under the Lilly Agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens, for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by the Company or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Under the research award agreement with CFFT, we are obligated to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to five times the actual award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	We have been a clinical-stage company since inception and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidates.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	the acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The Company s cash balance of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2017, together with the net proceeds of $11.1 million from the Second Closing of the Private Placement and $3.1 million from the exercise of warrants and sale of common stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement subsequent to December 31, 2017 is expected to fund the Company s operations through the first half of 2018.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	The Company s current cash position is sufficient to enable it to complete its Phase 3 clinical study of Sollpura (the RESULT study) in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis, which study s topline data is expected in March 2018.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	If the RESULT study meets its primary endpoint, the Company plans to raise sufficient capital following the study s readout and use the proceeds to fund the preparation of its Biologics License Application ( BLA ) for Sollpura, continuation of its manufacturing of drug products and general corporate purpose.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company cannot ascertain any future financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	If adequate funds are not available, the Company will be required to delay its development programs.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	This would include, amongst other things, eliminating or reducing the scope of one more of our clinical trials, delaying BLA submission for Sollpura, delaying manufacturing activities, and reducing headcount.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	The Company plans to meet its capital requirements for the next twelve months primarily through issuances of equity securities, potential partnerships and debt financing.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P87_S5	Failure to raise additional capital would adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1316175_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1316175_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
1316175_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and market prices.
1316175_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, since a majority of our investments are in highly liquid money market funds, we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure.
1316175_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any material derivative financial instruments.
1316175_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents was $2.2 million as of December 31, 2017.

1316175_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive officer and Principal Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to that company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this report.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process, effected by an entity s board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures which pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management s and or the board of directors authorization; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material errors in our consolidated financial statements.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with our policies and procedures may deteriorate.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We reviewed the results of management s assessment with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP was not required to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reports due to the exemptions allowed to smaller reporting companies under the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009.
1316175_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1316175_18_ITEM10_P31_S0	Our Compensation Committee participates in the design of compensation structures that create incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with the Company s business strategy.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P32_S0	Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees governance-related risks by working with management to develop and recommend to the Board corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company, making recommendations regarding director nominees and membership on Board committees and overseeing the annual evaluation of the Board and management.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P33_S0	As part of its oversight function, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee in particular, along with our management team, considers potential risks when reviewing and approving various compensation plans, including executive compensation.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P33_S1	Based on this review, our Board of Directors has concluded that such compensation plans, including executive compensation, do not encourage risk taking to a degree that is reasonably likely to have a materially adverse impact on us or our operations.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P34_S0	During 2017, the Board of Directors held a total of eight meetings.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P34_S1	All directors attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of Board committees on which the director served during the time he served on the Board or such committees.

1316175_18_ITEM10_P36_S2	Furthermore, our Audit Committee meets the enhanced independence standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rulemaking of the SEC.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P36_S3	The Board of Directors has further determined that Brian R. Mueller, Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, is an Audit Committee Financial Expert, as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P36_S4	Copies of our Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee charters and our corporate governance guidelines are available, free of charge, on our website at http://www.anthera.com.

1316175_18_ITEM10_P37_S1	The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and discussing with management and the independent registered public accounting firm our annual and quarterly financial statements and related disclosures and preparing the report required by the rules of the SEC to be included in our annual proxy statement.

1316175_18_ITEM10_P37_S3	Currently, the Audit Committee is comprised of Mr. Mueller (Chair), Dr. Henney and Mr. Furse.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P37_S4	During 2017, the Audit Committee held five meetings.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P38_S0	The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves our goals and objectives relevant to compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, evaluates our Chief Executive Officer in light of such goals and determines the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer.

1316175_18_ITEM10_P40_S0	The positions of Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are presently separated and the Chairman and Chief Executive positions have historically been separated at Anthera.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P40_S1	Separating these positions allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day-to-day business, while allowing the Executive Chairman of the Board to lead the Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing advice to, and independent oversight of, management.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P40_S2	Our Board of Directors recognizes the time, effort and energy that the Chief Executive Officer is required to devote to his position in the current business environment, as well as the commitment required to serve as our Executive Chairman, particularly as the Board of Directors oversight responsibilities continue to grow.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P40_S3	Our Board of Directors also believes that this structure ensures a greater role for the independent directors in the oversight of our Company and active participation of the independent directors in setting agendas and establishing priorities and procedures for the work of our Board of Directors.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P40_S4	Our Board of Directors believes its administration of its risk oversight function has not affected its leadership structure.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P41_S0	While our bylaws and corporate governance guidelines do not require that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions be separate, our Board of Directors believes that having separate positions and having an independent outside director serve as Chairman is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P41_S1	Our separated Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions are augmented by the independence of six of our seven directors, and our three entirely independent Board committees that provide appropriate oversight in the areas described above.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P41_S2	At executive sessions of independent directors, these directors speak candidly on any matter of interest, without the Chief Executive Officer or other executives present.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P41_S3	The independent directors met five times in 2016 without management present.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P41_S4	We believe this structure provides consistent and effective oversight of our management and the Company.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P42_S0	None of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has at any time during the past fiscal year been an officer or employee of the Company.

1316175_18_ITEM10_P43_S0	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the SEC.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P43_S1	Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required to furnish us with copies of all such forms which they file.
1316175_18_ITEM10_P44_S0	To our knowledge, based solely on our review of such reports or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all of the filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors, greater than 10% beneficial owners and other persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act were complied with during the year ended December 31, 2017.

1316175_18_ITEM11_P0_S4	Pursuant to the program, each new non-employee director receives a non-qualified stock option, which vests monthly over three years with equal monthly installments, to purchase shares of our common stock equal in value to approximately $150,000.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P0_S5	In addition, each non-employee director receives an annual grant of non-qualified stock options, which vest monthly over one year with equal monthly installments, to purchase shares of our common stock equal in value to approximately $120,000.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P0_S6	The number of shares subject to such options are determined based on the aggregate fair value, divided by the fair value per share, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the grant date.

1316175_18_ITEM11_P6_S0	The base salaries of our named executive officers are primarily established based on the scope of their responsibilities and performance, taking into account comparable company data from our compensation consultants and based upon our Compensation Committee s understanding of compensation paid to similarly situated executives, and adjusted as necessary to recruit or retain specific individuals.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P6_S1	We typically review the base salaries of our named executive officers annually.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P6_S2	The salaries for our named executive officers are as follows:
1316175_18_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Board of Directors adopted the Company s Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, or the Bonus Plan, which applies to certain key executives, or the Executives, that are recommended by the Compensation Committee and selected by the Board.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P7_S1	The Bonus Plan provides for bonus payments based upon the attainment of performance targets established by the Board and related to financial and operational metrics with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or the Performance Goals, which would include the achievement of clinical study or operational milestones, results of clinical studies and achievement of specified financial metrics or objectives.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P7_S2	Each Executive is given a targeted bonus opportunity set for each performance period.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P7_S3	The maximum bonus payable to an Executive under the Bonus Plan is 125% of the Executive s bonus opportunity.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Performance Goals are measured at the end of each fiscal year after the Company s financial reports have been published or such other appropriate time as the Board shall determine.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P8_S1	If the Performance Goals are met, payments are made within 30 days thereafter, and if met for the previous fiscal year, not later than March 31.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P9_S0	We generally grant stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers, in connection with their initial employment with us.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P9_S1	We also typically grant stock options on an annual basis as part of annual performance reviews of our employees.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P9_S2	In exercising its discretion to determine the amount of each grant for recommendation to our Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee generally took into account each individual s contributions towards the achievement of our annual corporate goals.

1316175_18_ITEM11_P10_S2	Our goal in providing severance benefits is to offer sufficient cash continuity protection such that our executives will focus their full time and attention on the requirements of the business rather than the potential implications of their respective positions.
1316175_18_ITEM11_P10_S3	We prefer to have certainty regarding the potential severance amounts payable to the named executive officers under certain circumstances, rather than negotiating severance at the time that a named executive officer s employment terminates.

1316175_18_ITEM13_P7_S1	In addition, Section 145 provides that a corporation has the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of its directors and officers against any liability asserted against them and incurred by them in their capacity as a director or officer, or arising out of their status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the director or officer against such liability under Section 145.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P8_S0	We have adopted provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that limit or eliminate the personal liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as it now exists or may in the future be amended.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P8_S1	Consequently, a director will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages or breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability for:
1316175_18_ITEM13_P9_S0	any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P10_S0	These limitations of liability do not alter director liability under the federal securities laws and do not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as an injunction or rescission.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P11_S0	In addition, our bylaws provide that:
1316175_18_ITEM13_P12_S0	we will advance reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, to our directors and, in the discretion of our board of directors, to our officers and certain employees, in connection with legal proceedings relating to their service for or on behalf of us, subject to limited exceptions.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P13_S0	We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our executive officers.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P13_S1	These agreements provide that we will indemnify each of our directors, certain of our executive officers and, at times, their affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P13_S2	We will advance expenses, including attorneys fees (but excluding judgments, fines and settlement amounts), to each indemnified director, executive officer or affiliate in connection with any proceeding in which indemnification is available and we will indemnify our directors and officers for any action or proceeding arising out of that person s services as a director or officer brought on behalf of the Company or in furtherance of our rights.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P13_S3	Additionally, certain of our directors may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance provided by their affiliates, which indemnification relates to and might apply to the same proceedings arising out of such director s services as a director referenced herein.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P13_S4	Nonetheless, we have agreed in the indemnification agreements that the Company s obligations to those same directors are primary and any obligation of the affiliates of those directors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the expenses or liabilities incurred by those directors are secondary.
1316175_18_ITEM13_P14_S0	We also maintain a general liability insurance policy which covers certain liabilities of directors and officers of our Company arising out of claims based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
