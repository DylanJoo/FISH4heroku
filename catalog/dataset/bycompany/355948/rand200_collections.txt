355948_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We intend to reduce costs to improve our profitability.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our EDG and Canvys businesses generated modest operating income during fiscal 2011.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	With the closing of the Transaction, we are taking actions to re-align our cost structure to fit the remaining businesses.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our ability to complete these actions may be limited by a variety of factors.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Cost-reduction actions to achieve our cost reduction objectives could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources whether or not achieved, and, consequently, could affect our ability to serve customers and to hire and retain key personnel.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We maintain a significant investment in inventory.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have also incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The market for many of our products is characterized by rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, and frequent new product introductions by some of our customers.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers and accurately forecast our customer demands, our customers may not continue to place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we will be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	This may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face competitive pressure in the markets we serve.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We face many competitors, both global and local, in the markets we serve.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our competition includes hundreds of electronic component distributors of various sizes, locations, and market focuses, as well as original equipment manufacturers and refurbishers.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Some of our competitors have greater resources and broader name recognition than we do.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	As a result, these competitors may be able to better withstand changing conditions within our markets and throughout the economy as a whole.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	EDG is dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply it with essential products.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Electron tubes and certain other products supplied by EDG are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We believe that vendors supplying products to some of the product lines of EDG are consolidating their distribution relationships or exiting the business.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	To the extent that our significant suppliers reduce the amount of products they sell through distribution are unwilling to continue to do business with us, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations to us, such as by extending lead times, limiting supplies, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Because we sell and source our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, many of our employees, suppliers, and warehouse facilities are located outside the United States.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including:
355948_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war, or natural disasters, may negatively affect our results from operations Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We sell many of our components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Since a defect or failure in a product could give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages that result.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As of July 22, 2011, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 67% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of most stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Foreign currency exchange rates may materially affect our results.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Since a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to movements in non-U.S. currency exchange rates, which may harm our results of operations.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If customers with a significant accounts receivable balance were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity could be adversely affected.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Future acquisitions are subject to integration and other risks.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We anticipate that we may, from time to time, selectively acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or assets.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ Global Select Market.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could:
355948_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	require us to seek to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We are currently a defendant in one patent infringement lawsuit and have received a claim for indemnification from a customer who is a defendant in a second patent infringement lawsuit.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Any of these suits could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In March 2011, Kyocera International, Inc. filed a complaint against us, Richardson RFPD, Inc., Arrow Electronics Inc. and Fractus, S.A., in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain products manufactured by Fractus, S.A., and offered for sale by our former RFPD division, infringe two patents owned by Kyocera Corporation and exclusively licensed to Kyocera International, Inc.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The complaint seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, and costs.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We sold the products at issue under the terms of a Distribution Agreement with Fractus pursuant to which Fractus agreed to indemnify us from any losses, costs, liabilities, damages or expenses arising from infringement or alleged infringement of intellectual property rights in connection with our sale of Fractus products.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In March 2011, we were notified by 3M Company that a complaint had been filed against us on March 16, 2011, by Ogma, LLC in the Eastern District of Texas.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The complaint alleges that several of 3M s products infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,825,427 owned by Ogma.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our Canvys division supplies at least one of the products at issue to 3M pursuant to a Product Supply Agreement, and 3M has asserted a claim for indemnity against us pursuant to the terms of the Product Supply Agreement.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	These lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert our management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We depend on key management and employees, the loss of whom may prevent us from implementing our business plans, limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We are dependent on the talent and resources of our key executives and employees.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S7	In particular, the success of our business depends to a great extent on Edward J. Richardson, our President, Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Mr. Richardson has extensive experience in the electron device industry, and his services are critical to our success.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We have not obtained key man insurance with respect to Mr. Richardson or any of our executive officers.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P23_S10	The loss of Mr. Richardson may prevent us from implementing our business plan, which may limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	As a result of the closing of the Transaction, we have significant cash reserves.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, we may be subject to burdensome compliance requirements and may have to:
355948_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	report, maintain records and adhere to voting, proxy, disclosure and other requirements.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The Acquisition Agreement exposes us to contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We have agreed to indemnify Arrow Electronics for breaches of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by us in the Acquisition Agreement, for losses arising out of or in connection with excluded assets or excluded liabilities, and for certain other matters.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Significant indemnification claims by Arrow Electronics could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	We are not obligated to indemnify Arrow Electronics for any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made by us under the Acquisition Agreement unless any individual claim for indemnification exceeds $10,000 and the aggregate amount of all such claims for indemnification exceed $2.1 million.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In the event that claims for indemnification for breach of most of the representations and warranties made by us under the Acquisition Agreement exceed this threshold, we will be obligated to indemnify Arrow Electronics for any damages or loss resulting from such breach in excess of $2.1 million up to $42 million.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Claims for indemnification for breaches of covenants made by us under the Acquisition Agreement and for breaches of representations and warranties related to authorization, taxes and brokers will not be subject to the deductible or aggregate liability cap described above.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Claims for indemnification for losses by Arrow Electronics arising out of or in connection with excluded assets or excluded liabilities and certain other matters are not subject to any of the individual limit, the deductible or the aggregate liability cap described above.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If the information technology services that are rendered to us pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement with Arrow Electronics do not adequately support us, our business may suffer.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement with Arrow Electronics, Arrow Electronics purchased our entire IT operations, and pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement between us and Arrow, Arrow provides IT services to us consistent with those services provided to us by our IT operations prior to the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We rely on these information systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If the IT services provided by Arrow Electronics are not provided to us in an adequate manner, we may be unable to find an alternative means of obtaining such IT services, which could significantly impair our ability to effectively serve our customers and perform other vital company functions.

355948_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	As of May 28, 2011, all domestic federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards were fully utilized.
355948_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.0 million, primarily related to states where the utilization of NOLs have been suspended for the next four taxable years.
355948_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	Foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.9 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	The alternative minimum tax credit carryforward and all foreign tax credit carryforwards were also fully utilized as of May 28, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	Based on this, our future U.S. federal statutory tax rate is expected to be closer to 35%, our state effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 3.5%, and our foreign effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%.
355948_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $3.4 million, $1.5 million, and $2.6 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

355948_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	We are no longer subject to either U.S. federal, state or local, or non-U.S. tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2004.
355948_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Currently, we are under federal audit in the U.S. for fiscal years 2009 and 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	Based on the recent commencement of the audit, no tax matters have arisen that would result in material adjustments.

355948_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The total consideration paid by Arrow at the closing of the Transaction was $238.8 million which included an estimated pre-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	The final purchase price is subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	On June 29, 2011, we received notification from Arrow seeking a post-closing working capital adjustment, which would reduce the purchase price by approximately $4.2 million.
355948_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The $4.2 million is included in our results from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Following the Transaction, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted cash bonus compensation to certain executive officers and former employees in recognition of their efforts for successfully completing the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	The cash bonus compensation amount awarded was approximately $3.8 million, and was recorded as expense from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	To help facilitate the transition of RFPD to Arrow, we agreed to provide certain transitional services to Arrow such as financial support services, warehouse services, and access to facilities in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Arrow also agreed to provide certain transitional services such as information technology services, warehouse services, and access to facilities and equipment in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	The duration of the transitional services are less than one year from March 1, 2011, except for the information technology services which is three years.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	In addition, we entered into a Manufacturing Agreement with Arrow, in connection with the Transaction, for a term of three years.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, we agreed to manufacture certain products for Arrow.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	The Transition Services Agreement, which commenced on March 1, 2011, will allow us to exert very limited influence over Arrow s operating and financial policies.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S6	Also, the continuing cash flows related to our Transition Services Agreement as well as the Manufacturing Agreement, are insignificant.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S7	We believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the Transition Services Agreement that relate to financial support, certain facilities, and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to RFPD.
355948_11_ITEM7_P26_S8	We further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the Manufacturing Agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to RFPD.
355948_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	On May 31, 2007, we completed the sale of the Security Systems Division/Burtek Systems ( SSD/Burtek ) to Honeywell International Inc. ( Honeywell ).
355948_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The sale agreement of SSD/Burtek to Honeywell contemplated a post-closing working capital-based purchase price adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we received notification from Honeywell seeking a purchase price adjustment and we issued a dispute notice in a timely manner.
355948_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	On December 18, 2009, we reached an agreement with Honeywell to settle the pending working capital disputes as well as other related claims.
355948_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	As a result, we recorded $1.2 million of expense, net of zero tax effect, as a loss from discontinued operations during fiscal 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	Financial Summary Discontinued Operations Summary financial results for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 are presented in the following table ( in thousands ):
355948_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	In accordance with ASC 205-20, the allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations of other consolidated interest that is not directly attributable to or related to other operations of the entity is permitted but not required.
355948_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The consolidated interest that cannot be attributed to other operations of the entity is allocated based on the ratio of net assets to be sold or discontinued to the total consolidated net assets.
355948_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	We appropriately allocated approximately $0.4 million, $2.7 million, and $3.3 million of interest expense to discontinued operations for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, using the ratio of net assets that we sold or that became discontinued to total assets.
355948_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	Assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations on our consolidated balance sheets as of May 28, 2011, and May 29, 2010, include the following ( in thousands ):
355948_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	(1) Accrued liabilities as of May 28, 2011, includes $11.7 million due to Arrow which includes a $4.2 million proposed purchase price adjustment, $6.0 million for receivables collected by the Company on behalf of Arrow, and vacation and pension funds of $1.5 million in connection with the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	There is also approximately $5.1 million of other accrued liabilities including severance and success bonuses recorded in connection with the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	These amounts are partially offset by approximately $3.0 million owed to the Company from Arrow in connection with the Transaction which consists of fees for transition services, facility lease deposits, severance costs, and indirect taxes.
355948_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	In accordance with ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, entities are permitted but not required to separately disclose, either in the statement of cash flows or footnotes to the financial statements, cash flows pertaining to discontinued operations.
355948_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Entities that do not present separate operating cash flow information related to discontinued operations must do so consistently for all periods presented, which may include periods long after the sale or liquidation of the operation.
355948_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	We currently do not have cash balances that are specific to RFPD and as a result, we believe that it is appropriate to not present separate cash flows from discontinued operations on our statement of cash flows.
355948_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our growth and cash needs have been primarily financed through income from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
355948_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Liquidity under our revolving credit facility is primarily available to fund our working capital requirements and support capital expenditures.
355948_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	As a result of accounting for RFPD as a discontinued operation, we anticipate that cash flow from operating activities will continue to be a source of cash.
355948_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	While net income will significantly decline as a result of the sale, our working capital investment and capital spending requirements will also significantly decline.
355948_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Cash and cash equivalents were $171.0 million at May 28, 2011, excluding CD s and time deposits classified as short-term investments of $52.1 million and long-term investments of $16.3 million, as compared to $29.0 million at May 29, 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	In accordance with ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, entities are permitted but not required to separately disclose, either in the statement of cash flows or footnotes to the financial statements, cash flows pertaining to discontinued operations.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Entities that do not present separate operating cash flows information related to discontinued operations must do so consistently for all periods presented, which may include periods long after the sale or liquidation of the operation.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	We currently do not have cash balances that are specific to RFPD and as a result, we believe that the appropriate presentation would be to not separate cash flows from discontinued operations on our statement of cash flows.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	Upon closing the Transaction, we received $238.8 million which included an estimated pre-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	On June 29, 2011, we received notification from Arrow seeking a post-closing working capital adjustment of approximately $4.2 million.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S5	We believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future growth strategies for our remaining business.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S6	Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities, including our discontinued operations, during fiscal 2011 was $2.1 million.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S7	The $2.1 million included a pre-tax gain on the sale of RFPD of $111.4 million, offset by a source of cash of $117.5 million created from the change in assets and liabilities due to the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S8	Excluding the Transaction, cash used by operating activities, including discontinued operations, was $4.0 million.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S9	Cash provided by operating activities, including our discontinued operations, during fiscal 2010 was $24.3 million, due primarily to lower inventory balances and higher accounts payable, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S10	The decline in inventory balances of $0.4 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange of $0.7 million and inventory provisions of $1.3 million, during fiscal 2010, was due primarily to increased sales volume and higher inventory turns.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S11	The increase in accounts payable balances of $9.1 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange of $0.4 million, during fiscal 2010, was due primarily to the timing of payments.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S12	The increase in accounts receivable balances of $8.0 million, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange of $1.4 million during fiscal 2010, was due primarily to higher sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S13	Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities, including our discontinued operations, of $160.0 million during fiscal 2011, was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of RFPD of $229.0 million, partially offset by the purchase of $68.4 million in time deposits and CDs, capital expenditures of $0.5 million for information technology projects and building improvements, and $0.1 million for market value adjustments on our investments.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S14	Net cash used in investing activities, including our discontinued operations, of $2.4 million during fiscal 2010, was due primarily to capital expenditures of $1.3 million for information technology projects and building improvements, and $1.0 million for the cash settlement related to SSD/Burtek.
355948_11_ITEM7_P34_S15	Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities, including our discontinued operations, of $24.5 million during fiscal 2011 was due primarily to the repayment of our short-term debt, repurchase of common stock, and cash dividends paid, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
355948_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	activities, including our discontinued operations, of $35.7 million during fiscal 2010 was due primarily to cash dividends paid, the repurchase of our 8% convertible senior subordinated notes and repurchases of our common stock.
355948_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Dividend payments during fiscal 2011 were approximately $1.9 million.
355948_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	As of May 28, 2011, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, as we paid down the $22.0 million outstanding balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and terminated the agreement on February 28, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	On June 11, 2010, we redeemed all $19.5 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 7 3 / 4 % Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
355948_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	See Note 6 Debt of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the redemption.
355948_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations by expiration period are presented in the table below as of May 28, 2011 ( in thousands ):
355948_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	(1) Lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	(2) IT services are related to the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	We believe that existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending June 2, 2012.
355948_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Management continuously evaluates the significant estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, goodwill impairment testing, income taxes, contingencies, and litigation.
355948_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations.
355948_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
355948_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million as of May 28, 2011, and May 29, 2010, respectively.
355948_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Impairment of Investments We hold a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assess its recoverability.
355948_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment, judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary.
355948_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Management s assessment as to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline, financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, and our cash requirements and intent to hold the investment.
355948_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	If an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary, an appropriate write-down is recorded.
355948_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	We recognized investment impairment charges of less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2009.
355948_11_ITEM7_P46_S5	We did not recognize any investment impairment charges during fiscal 2011 and 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our sales are recorded net of discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	In a limited number of cases, we provide and bill our customers with non-product related services, such as testing, calibration, non-recurring engineering, tooling, and installation services.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S6	We have concluded that the service revenue should not be considered a separate unit of accounting from the product sale as we have determined there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S7	We have also concluded that, in the limited cases where remaining obligations exist after delivery of the product, the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory.
355948_11_ITEM7_P47_S8	This conclusion was reached based on the following facts: the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer, which in most cases, is performed immediately after the delivery of the product; the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is minimal, the costs and time do not vary significantly; we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely; and finally, failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or the service.
355948_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Inventories Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our inventories included $28.0 million of finished goods and $2.9 million of raw materials and work-in-progress.
355948_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain market segments, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $1.1 million, $0.2 million, and $7.6 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_11_ITEM7_P49_S3	The provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_11_ITEM7_P49_S4	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	In accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operations ( ASC 205-20 ), we reported the financial results of RFPD as a discontinued operation.
355948_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Refer to Note 4 Discontinued Operations of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the sale of RFPD.
355948_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	When only a range of a possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Long-Lived Assets We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including software, property, plant and equipment.
355948_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	We assess in accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( ASC 360-10 ), the possibility of long-lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood.
355948_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Impairment is assessed when the expected cash flows to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount.
355948_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	If impairment exists, the carrying value of the impaired asset is reduced to its net realizable value.
355948_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	The impairment charge is recorded in operating results.
355948_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	The results of our impairment tests for fiscal 2011 and 2010 indicated no impairment of our long-lived assets.
355948_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Warranties We offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture.
355948_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty.
355948_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
355948_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale.
355948_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.
355948_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
355948_11_ITEM7_P55_S6	With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period, and warranty experience.
355948_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
355948_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
355948_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience, and other available evidence.
355948_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	See Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Stock Compensation Effective June 4, 2006, we adopted ASC 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options.
355948_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends.
355948_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	See Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	See Note 8 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income, ( ASC Update No. 2011-05 ) .
355948_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	This amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
355948_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
355948_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	ASU Update No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
355948_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
355948_11_ITEM7_P61_S5	ASU Update No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.
355948_11_ITEM7_P61_S6	No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC update No 2009-13, Revenue Recognition, ( ASC Update No. 2009-13 ), which addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit.
355948_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Specifically, the guidance amends the criteria in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements.
355948_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: ( a ) vendor-specific objective evidence; ( b ) third-party evidence; or ( c ) estimates.
355948_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
355948_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	In addition, the guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
355948_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	ASC Update No. 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We manage these risks through normal operating activities.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates and interest rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exposure Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We could manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in sales contracts, local debt to offset asset exposures, and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P0_S6	We have not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, or fiscal 2009.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $15.7 million during fiscal 2011 and an estimated $13.2 million during fiscal 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $29.4 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, and an estimated $28.6 million as of the fiscal year ended May 29, 2010, while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $1.5 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, and an estimated $1.7 million as of the fiscal year ended May 29, 2010.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in interest rates and exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.

355948_11_ITEM8_P1_S5	The consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2010, and our consolidated statements of operations for the three and twelve months ended May 29, 2010, and May 30, 2009, have been restated to reflect the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM8_P1_S6	Refer to Note 4 Discontinued Operations of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the sale of RFPD.
355948_11_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our fiscal year 2011 began on May 30, 2010, and ended on May 28, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM8_P1_S8	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the significant estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, goodwill impairment testing, income taxes, contingencies, and litigation.
355948_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our financial instruments include accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and long-term debt.
355948_11_ITEM8_P3_S2	The fair values of these financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values at May 28, 2011, and May 29, 2010.
355948_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_11_ITEM8_P5_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.4 million as of May 28, 2011, and $0.4 million as of May 29, 2010.
355948_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	Inventories: Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	Our inventories include $28.0 million of finished goods and $2.9 million of raw materials and work-in-progress.
355948_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
355948_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
355948_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	Provisions for depreciation are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
355948_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	Depreciation expense was approximately $1.2 million, $1.4 million, and $1.6 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
355948_11_ITEM8_P9_S2	Property, plant and equipment consist of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Supplemental disclosure information of the estimated useful life of the asset:
355948_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	In accordance with ASC 350-40, Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Internal-Use Software ( ASC 350-40 ) during the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we made the decision not to proceed with the implementation of various modules of enterprise resource management software that were in the development stage and were capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40.
355948_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	As a result, we recorded a loss on disposal of assets of $5.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
355948_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Investments: During fiscal 2011, we invested in time deposits and certificate of deposits ( CD ) in the amount of $68.4 million.
355948_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	Of this, $52.1 million mature in less than twelve months and $16.3 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_11_ITEM8_P12_S2	The fair value of these investments is the face value of each time deposit and CD.
355948_11_ITEM8_P12_S3	We also have investments in equity securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
355948_11_ITEM8_P12_S4	Our investments, which are included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.4 million and $0.3 million at May 28, 2011, and at May 29, 2010, respectively.
355948_11_ITEM8_P12_S5	Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.2 million during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009.
355948_11_ITEM8_P12_S6	We reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities in all periods.
355948_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
355948_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	Gross realized gains and losses on those sales were immaterial during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010.
355948_11_ITEM8_P13_S2	Net unrealized holding losses were $0.1 million for fiscal 2011 and were immaterial for fiscal 2010, and have been included in accumulated comprehensive income (loss) during its respective fiscal year.
355948_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The following table presents the disclosure under ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities, for the investment in marketable equity securities with fair values less than cost basis ( in thousands ): Accrued Liabilities: Accrued liabilities consist of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Warranties: We offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture.
355948_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty.
355948_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
355948_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale.
355948_11_ITEM8_P15_S4	We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.
355948_11_ITEM8_P15_S5	Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
355948_11_ITEM8_P15_S6	With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period, and warranty experience.
355948_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
355948_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
355948_11_ITEM8_P16_S2	The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience, and other available evidence.
355948_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Changes in the warranty reserve during fiscal 2011 and 2010 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	The reserve adjustments resulted from lower sales of products under warranty and lower than estimated failure rates.
355948_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	Other Non-Current Liabilities: Other non-current liabilities of $0.4 million at May 28, 2011, and $0.5 million at May 29, 2010, primarily represent retirement obligations in various non-US locations.
355948_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheet are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period spot rates.
355948_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity.
355948_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the current rate on the date of the transaction.
355948_11_ITEM8_P18_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.
355948_11_ITEM8_P18_S4	Foreign currency translation reflected in our consolidated statements of operations was a loss of $0.6 million during fiscal 2011, a loss of $1.1 million during fiscal 2010, and a gain of $1.3 million during fiscal 2009.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	Our sales are recorded net of discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S5	In a limited number of cases, we provide and bill our customers with non-product related services, such as testing, calibration, non-recurring engineering, tooling, and installation services.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S6	We have concluded that the service revenue should not be considered a separate unit of accounting from the product sale as we have determined there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S7	We have also concluded that, in the limited cases where remaining obligations exist after delivery of the product, the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory.
355948_11_ITEM8_P19_S8	This conclusion was reached based on the following facts: the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer, which in most cases, is performed immediately after the delivery of the product; the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is minimal, the costs and time do not vary significantly; we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely; and finally, failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or the service.
355948_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.
355948_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_11_ITEM8_P21_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Discontinued Operations: In accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements-Discontinued Operations ( ASC 205-20 ), we reported the financial results of RFPD as a discontinued operation.
355948_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	Refer to Note 4 Discontinued Operations of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the sale of RFPD.
355948_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We measure and recognize compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options.
355948_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends.
355948_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Compensation cost is recognized using a graded-vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period, or date on which retirement eligibility is achieved, if shorter (non-substantive vesting period approach).
355948_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Share-based compensation expense totaled approximately $1.2 million during fiscal 2011 and $0.6 million during both fiscal 2010 and 2009.
355948_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (in thousands, except per share amounts) Stock options granted to members of the Board of Directors generally vest immediately and stock options granted to employees generally vest over a period of five years and have contractual terms to exercise of 10 years.
355948_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows (in thousands, except option prices and years):
355948_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	There were 699,000 stock options exercised during fiscal 2011, with cash received of $5.4 million.
355948_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised totaled $2.8 million during fiscal 2011, $0.3 million during fiscal 2010, and no stock options were exercised during fiscal 2009.
355948_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	The weighted average fair value of stock option grants was $6.72 during fiscal 2011, $2.81 during fiscal 2010, and $2.26 during fiscal 2009.
355948_11_ITEM8_P28_S3	As of May 28, 2011, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options was approximately $1.9 million which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of five years.
355948_11_ITEM8_P28_S4	The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during fiscal 2011 was $0.7 million.
355948_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
355948_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience.
355948_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).
355948_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	On December 21, 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 110 stating that they will continue to accept SAB No. 107, past the original expiration date of December 31, 2007.
355948_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	For stock options granted during fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, we believe that our historical stock option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
355948_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	We utilized the Safe Harbor option, or Simplified Method, to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with SAB No. 107 for options granted.
355948_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	We intend to continue to utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with SAB No. 110 until such time that we believe that our historical stock option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.
355948_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at May 28, 2011 ( in thousands, except option prices and years ):
355948_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	A summary of restricted stock award transactions was as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Compensation effects arising from issuing stock awards have been charged against income and recorded as additional paid-in-capital in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income (loss) and were immaterial during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009.
355948_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Employees 2001 Incentive Compensation Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,800,000 shares as incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or stock awards.
355948_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	Under this plan and predecessor plans, 1,314,175 shares are reserved for future issuance.
355948_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Plan authorizes the granting of incentive stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant.
355948_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	Generally, these options become exercisable over five years and expire up to 10 years from the date of grant.
355948_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	On June 16, 2005, our Board of Directors adopted the 2006 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors which authorizes the issuance of up to 400,000 shares as non-qualified stock options.
355948_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	Under this plan, 215,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for future issuances relating to stock options exercisable based on the passage of time.
355948_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	Each option is exercisable over a period of time from its date of grant at the market value on the grant date and expires after 10 years.
355948_11_ITEM8_P39_S3	This plan replaces the 1996 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors which was terminated on June 16, 2005.
355948_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Earnings per Share: We have authorized 30,000,000 shares of common stock, 10,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
355948_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time.
355948_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
355948_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.
355948_11_ITEM8_P41_S2	Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method as prescribed in ASC 260.
355948_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income, adjusted for interest savings, net of tax, on assumed conversion of convertible debentures and notes, by the actual shares outstanding and share equivalents that would arise from the exercise of stock options, certain restricted stock awards, and the assumed conversion of convertible debentures and notes when dilutive.
355948_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	For fiscal 2011, our 7 3 / 4 % Notes were repurchased, thus eliminating any effect from the dilutive calculation.
355948_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	For fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, the assumed conversion and the effect of the interest savings of our 7 3 / 4 % Notes were excluded because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
355948_11_ITEM8_P43_S3	For fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, the weighted-average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share is equal to the basic weighted average shares due to the loss from continuing operations during these periods.
355948_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The per share amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations are based on the following ( amounts in thousands, except per share amounts ):
355948_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Note: Common stock options that were anti-dilutive and not included in diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009 were 237,064, 339,714, and 1,634,627, respectively.
355948_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (in thousands, except per share amounts) New Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income, ( ASC Update No. 2011-05 ) .
355948_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	This amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
355948_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
355948_11_ITEM8_P46_S3	ASU Update No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
355948_11_ITEM8_P46_S4	The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
355948_11_ITEM8_P46_S5	ASU Update No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.
355948_11_ITEM8_P46_S6	For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim period within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and as such we will adopt ASC Update No. 2011-05 during our third quarter fiscal 2012.
355948_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC update No 2009-13, Revenue Recognition, ( ASC Update No. 2009-13 ), which addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit.
355948_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	Specifically, the guidance amends the criteria in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements.
355948_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: ( a ) vendor-specific objective evidence; ( b ) third-party evidence; or ( c ) estimates.
355948_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	The guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
355948_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	In addition, the guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
355948_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	ASC Update No. 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
355948_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
355948_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Arrow Transaction On October 1, 2010, we entered into an agreement with Arrow, where Arrow agreed to acquire all of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of RFPD, as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets in exchange for $210.0 million, subsequently re-negotiated to $211.8 million, subject to the purposed working capital adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	On March 1, 2011, we completed the closing of the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	The total consideration paid by Arrow at the closing of the Transaction was $238.8 million which included an estimated pre-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	The final purchase price is subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	On June 29, 2011, we received notification from Arrow seeking a post-closing working capital adjustment, which would reduce the purchase price by approximately $4.2 million.
355948_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	The $4.2 million is included in our results from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011.

355948_11_ITEM13_P38_S2	With these non-recurring costs behind us, we are well-positioned to deliver strong operating performance in Fiscal 2012, said Edward J. Richardson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.
355948_11_ITEM13_P39_S0	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.9% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 28.2% during the fourth quarter of last year.
355948_11_ITEM13_P39_S1	Gross margin included expense of approximately $1.0 million related to additional inventory reserve provisions.
355948_11_ITEM13_P40_S0	SG A expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $10.8 million, or 26.5% of net sales, compared to $11.5 million, or 29.7% of net sales, during the fourth quarter of last year.
355948_11_ITEM13_P40_S1	The fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 includes non-recurring costs related to a strategic distribution agreement of approximately $1.0 million.
355948_11_ITEM13_P41_S0	Operating income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $0.6 million, or 1.4% of net sales, compared to a loss of $0.6 million, for the fourth quarter last year.
355948_11_ITEM13_P42_S0	Income from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $1.1 million, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million during the fourth quarter of last year.
355948_11_ITEM13_P43_S0	Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $64.9 million, or $3.54 per diluted common share, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to $7.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
355948_11_ITEM13_P44_S0	Net income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $66.0 million, or $3.60 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $6.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share, in the prior year s fourth quarter.
355948_11_ITEM13_P44_S1	CASH USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES Total cash and investments as of fiscal year end were $239.7 million.
355948_11_ITEM13_P44_S2	In addition, we repurchased 645,900 shares for approximately $8.7 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_11_ITEM13_P44_S3	With our strong balance sheet, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through a combination of cash dividends, continued share repurchases and investments to fund our growth initiatives, said Mr. Richardson.
355948_11_ITEM13_P44_S4	To date, the company has repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares.
355948_11_ITEM13_P44_S5	As of today, $34 million remains under our existing share repurchase authorization from the company s board of directors.
355948_11_ITEM13_P44_S6	This includes an incremental $25 million repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors on July 19, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM13_P45_S0	Share repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, subject to market conditions and trading restrictions.
355948_11_ITEM13_P45_S1	This authorization has no expiration and can be cancelled at any time.
355948_11_ITEM13_P46_S0	OUTLOOK EDG continues to experience strong sales growth as we benefit from strength within the global manufacturing sector as well as the incremental volume related to a strategic distribution agreement.
355948_11_ITEM13_P46_S1	The sales organization for Canvys is now clearly focused on winning design-in work with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
355948_11_ITEM13_P46_S2	While the sell cycle for OEMs tends to be longer, these customers better align with our long-term strategy and value proposition, said Mr. Richardson.
355948_11_ITEM13_P46_S3	We expect that sales for EDG and Canvys for the first quarter to be in the range of $41 million to $43 million, up 9% to 15% over the prior year, and sales for Fiscal 2012 should be in the range of $170 to $175 million, up 7% to 10% over Fiscal 2011.
355948_11_ITEM13_P46_S4	We are also confident that we will be able to achieve our operating margin target for the year of 5%, concluded Mr. Richardson.
355948_11_ITEM13_P46_S5	The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors voted to declare a $0.05 dividend per share to all holders of common stock and a $0.045 cash dividend per share to all holders of Class B common stock.
355948_11_ITEM13_P46_S6	The dividend will be payable on August 19, 2011, to all common stockholders of record on August 5, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM13_P47_S0	14,267,492 outstanding shares of common stock and 2,951,961 outstanding shares of Class B common stock.

355948_11_ITEM15_P4_S1	The $4.2 million is included in our results from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM15_P4_S2	The consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2010, and our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended May 29, 2010, and May 30, 2009, have been restated to reflect the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM15_P4_S3	Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 Discontinued Operations of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the Transaction.
355948_11_ITEM15_P5_S0	Our fiscal year 2011 began on May 30, 2010, and ended on May 28, 2011.
355948_11_ITEM15_P5_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	We have two continuing operating segments, which we define as follows: Electron Device Group ( EDG ) provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in diverse markets including the steel, automotive, textile, plastics, semiconductor manufacturing, avionics, and broadcast equipment industries.
355948_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	Canvys provides global integrated display solutions serving the financial, corporate enterprise, healthcare, industrial, and medical original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) markets.
355948_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions:
355948_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 is set forth in Note 10 Segment and Geographic Information of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Electron Device Group EDG manufactures and distributes electron tubes, microwave generators, vacuum capacitors and related components and sub-assemblies.
355948_11_ITEM15_P8_S1	EDG also provides engineered solutions consisting of design and assembly services, component modification and development of customer-specific solutions, designed to fit unique applications.
355948_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	EDG serves customers in diverse markets including manufacturers and users of equipment in the steel, automotive, textile, plastics, semiconductor manufacturing, avionics, and broadcast equipment industries.
355948_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	We design solutions and provide components for applications such as industrial heating, laser technology, semiconductor manufacturing, radar, and welding.
355948_11_ITEM15_P9_S2	Typically, our engineered solutions and products are used in applications requiring high power and high frequency.
355948_11_ITEM15_P9_S3	We provide our solutions and products to original manufacturers of systems and equipment requiring such high power or high frequency and provide replacement products to the industrial end-users of such systems and equipment.
355948_11_ITEM15_P9_S4	We represent and support leading manufacturers of electron tubes and microwave devices, including Amperex, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, Litton, L3, National, NJRC, and Thales.
355948_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	Canvys Canvys is a global provider of integrated display products, workstations, and value-add services to the financial, corporate enterprise, healthcare, industrial and OEM markets.
355948_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	Our engineers design, manufacture, source, and support a full spectrum of solutions to match the needs of our customers.
355948_11_ITEM15_P10_S2	We offer custom display solutions that include touch screens, protective panels, custom enclosures, specialized cabinet finishes, and application specific software packages.
355948_11_ITEM15_P10_S3	We also offer display products under our own brands, including Image Systems and Pixelink.
355948_11_ITEM15_P10_S4	In addition, we partner with leading branded hardware vendors to offer the highest quality liquid crystal displays, mounting devices, and customized computing platforms.
355948_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	As a longtime provider of healthcare solutions, we specialize in creating comprehensive solutions for diagnostic and clinical review, 3-D and post processing, surgical suites and modality-specific applications.
355948_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	In addition, all of our solutions meet certifications and calibration standards for patient monitoring, bio-medical displays, ultrasound, cardiac imaging, picture archiving, and communication systems.
355948_11_ITEM15_P11_S2	We have long-standing relationships with key component and finished goods manufacturers including 3M, HP, IBM, Intel, LG, NEC Displays, Sharp Electronics, Samsung, and WIDE Corporation.
355948_11_ITEM15_P11_S3	We believe our distributor relationships, combined with our manufacturing capabilities and private label brands, allow us to maintain a well-balanced and technologically advanced line of products.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	Products and Suppliers Our inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying product for replacement of components used in critical product equipment.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	In many cases, the market for our products is characterized by rapid change and obsolescence as a result of the introduction of new technologies.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S2	As of May 28, 2011, on average, we hold 72 days of inventory in the normal course of operations.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S3	This level of inventory reflects the fact that we also sell a number of products representing trailing edge technology.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S4	While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, we are increasing our market share.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S5	As manufacturers for these products exit the business, we often purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S6	We have distribution agreements with many of our suppliers; however, a number of these agreements provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which we can distribute their products.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S7	The agreements are generally short-term, subject to periodic renewal, and some contain provisions permitting termination by either party, without cause, upon relatively short notice.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S8	Although some of these agreements allow us to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case we may have obsolete inventory that we cannot return to the supplier.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S9	Our suppliers generally warrant the products we distribute and allow return of defective products, including those returned to us by our customers.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S10	Except for certain displays, we generally do not provide additional warranties on the products we sell.
355948_11_ITEM15_P12_S11	For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including: Amperex , Cetron , Image Systems , Pixelink , and National .
355948_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetron tubes, phototubes, microwave generators, large screen display monitors, liquid crystal display monitors, and computer workstations.
355948_11_ITEM15_P13_S2	The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics, and a wide variety of fabricated metal components.
355948_11_ITEM15_P13_S3	These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	Sales and Product Management As of the end of fiscal 2011, we employed 147 sales and product management personnel worldwide.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	In addition, we have authorized representatives, who are not our employees, selling our products, primarily in regions where we do not have a direct sales presence.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S2	We offer various credit terms to qualifying customers as well as prepayment, credit card, and cash on delivery terms.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S3	We establish credit limits for each sale prior to selling product to our customers and routinely review delinquent and aging accounts.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S4	Distribution We maintain approximately 65,500 part numbers in our product inventory database and we estimate that more than 80% of orders received by 6:00 p.m. local time are shipped complete the same day.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S5	Customers can access our product inventory on our web site, www.rell.com , through electronic data interchange, or by telephone.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S6	Customer orders are processed by our regional sales offices and supported primarily by one of our distribution facilities in LaFox, Illinois; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Marlborough, Massachusetts; Plymouth, Minnesota; or Donaueschingen, Germany.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S7	Our data processing network provides on-line, real-time interconnection of all sales offices and central distribution operations, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
355948_11_ITEM15_P14_S8	Information on stock availability, cross-reference information, customers, and market analyses are obtainable throughout the entire distribution network.
355948_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	International Sales During fiscal 2011, approximately 57.0% of our sales were made outside the U.S.
355948_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	We continue to pursue new international sales to further expand our geographic reach.
355948_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	As of May 28, 2011, we employed 307 individuals, of which 295 were full-time and 12 were part-time.
355948_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	Of these, 195 were located in the United States and 112 were located internationally.
355948_11_ITEM15_P16_S2	The worldwide employee base included 147 in sales and product management, 24 in distribution support, 80 in administrative positions, and 56 in value-add and product manufacturing.
355948_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	All of our employees are non-union, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
355948_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	Website Access to SEC Reports We maintain an Internet website at www.rell.com .
355948_11_ITEM15_P17_S2	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 are accessible through our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	should consider carefully the following risk factors in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We intend to grow our sales and reduce costs to improve our profitability.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our fixed costs are high relative to the size of our operations.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Since the sale of the RFPD division in March 2011, we have focused on re-aligning our cost structure to fit our remaining businesses.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We have significantly reduced our expenses during Fiscal 2012; and therefore, further expense reduction opportunities may be limited.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, cost reduction objectives could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources whether or not achieved, and, consequently, could affect our ability to serve customers and to hire and retain key personnel.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Our long-term objective is to double the size of our business over the next three to five years through acquisitions and internal growth initiatives, which will allow us to leverage our support function cost structure.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P0_S7	To the extent we do not achieve our growth objectives, it will be difficult to reduce our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The market for many of our products is characterized by rapid change resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our customers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not continue to place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we will be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	This may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face competitive pressure in the markets we serve.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We face many competitors, both global and local, in the markets we serve.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Not only do we compete with other distributors, we also compete for customers with many of our own suppliers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our competition includes hundreds of electronic component distributors of various sizes, locations, and market focuses, as well as original equipment manufacturers and refurbishers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Some of our competitors have greater resources and broader name recognition than we do.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S6	As a result, these competitors may be able to better withstand changing conditions within our markets and throughout the economy as a whole.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	EDG is dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply it with essential products.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	EDG s principal product is vacuum tubes.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These tubes and certain other products supplied by EDG are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	One of EDG s suppliers represents 18% of our total sales volume.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We believe that some vendors supplying products to EDG product lines are consolidating their distribution relationships as a result of the declining market for vacuum tubes.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	To the extent that our significant suppliers reduce the volume of product they sell through distribution and are unwilling to continue to do business with us, or extend lead times, or limiting supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Because we sell and source our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, many of our employees, suppliers, and warehouse facilities are located outside the United States.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including:
355948_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war, or natural disasters, may negatively affect our results from operations Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We sell many of our components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Additionally, we offer installation and repair services in conjunction with the selling of our components.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Since a defect or failure in a product or service could give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages that result.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As of July 22, 2012, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 69% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of most stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of our revenues, and consequently, we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may harm our results of operations.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A significant portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If customers with a significant accounts receivable balance were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity could be adversely affected.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Future acquisitions are subject to integration risks and other risks.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or assets.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ Global Select Market.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could:
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	require us to seek to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert our management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We depend on key management and employees, the loss of whom may prevent us from implementing our business plans, limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We are dependent on the talent and resources of our key executives and employees.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S9	In particular, the success of our business depends to a great extent on Edward J. Richardson, our President, Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Mr. Richardson has extensive experience in the electron device industry, and his services are critical to our success.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S11	We have not obtained key man insurance with respect to Mr. Richardson or any of our executive officers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S12	The loss of Mr. Richardson may prevent us from implementing our business plan, which may limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P21_S13	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As a result of the closing of the Transaction, we have significant cash reserves.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, we may be subject to burdensome compliance requirements and may have to:
355948_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	report, maintain records and adhere to voting, proxy, disclosure and other requirements.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	As a global company, we rely heavily on information technology systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We rely on these information systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If the IT services provided by Arrow Electronics are not provided to us in an adequate manner, we may be unable to find an alternative means of obtaining such IT services, which could significantly impair our ability to effectively serve our customers and perform other vital company functions.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Arrow s obligation to provide these IT services ends on March 1, 2014 although we are currently negotiating an extension to the Agreement.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We plan to migrate to a new ERP platform prior to the termination of these services.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	To the extent we cannot timely complete this project, our business may suffer and we may incur significant additional costs.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Our operating results during Fiscal 2012 show that the business has experienced a decline in sales volume, and there can be no assurance that we will experience a recovery in the near future; nor can there be any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers.
355948_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
355948_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	approximately 96 acres in LaFox, Illinois and consists of approximately 242,000 square feet of manufacturing, warehouse, and office space.
355948_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We maintain geographically diverse facilities because we believe this will limit market risk and exchange rate exposure.
355948_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	We consider our properties to be well maintained, in sound condition and repair, and adequate for our present needs.
355948_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The extent of utilization varies from property to property and from time to time during the year.
355948_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facility locations, their primary use, and segments served are as follows:
355948_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	* LaFox, Illinois is also the location of our corporate headquarters.
355948_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any current claims, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
355948_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Dividends Our quarterly dividend was $0.05 per common share and $0.045 per Class B common share.
355948_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Annual dividend payments for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were approximately $3.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
355948_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_12_ITEM5_P0_S3	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_12_ITEM5_P0_S4	On July 25, 2012, the Board of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.06 per common share.
355948_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ) under the trading symbol ( RELL ).
355948_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.
355948_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	As of July 23, 2012, there were approximately 771 stockholders of record for the common stock and approximately 18 stockholders of record for the Class B common stock.

355948_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	This section is organized as follows:
355948_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Results of Continuing Operations an analysis and comparison of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 2, 2012, May 28, 2011, and May 29, 2010, as reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
355948_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Liquidity, Financial Position, and Capital Resources a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash for the fiscal years ended June 2, 2012, May 28, 2011, and May 29, 2010, and a discussion of selected changes in our financial position.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Business Overview Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is incorporated in the state of Delaware.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	We are a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related components, and customized display solutions, serving customers in the alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S6	On March 1, 2011, we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of, our RFPD Division, as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets, to Arrow in exchange for $238.8 million, which included an estimated pre-closing working capital adjustment of approximately $27.0 million.
355948_12_ITEM7_P3_S7	The final purchase price was subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	On June 29, 2011, we received notification from Arrow seeking a post-closing working capital adjustment, which would reduce the purchase price by approximately $4.2 million.
355948_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We recorded the working capital adjustment of $4.2 million in our results from discontinued operations during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we agreed to approximately $3.9 million of the proposed working capital adjustment and adjusted our results from discontinued operations during the first quarter.
355948_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we paid Arrow $3.9 million to settle the agreed upon working capital adjustment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	On September 5, 2011, we acquired the assets of Powerlink for approximately $2.3 million, including a working capital adjustment of $0.2 million related to payables of approximately $0.2 million that were paid by Powerlink prior to the close.
355948_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	This acquisition positions us to provide cost-effective service of microwave and power grid tube equipment for communications, industrial, military and medical users around the world.
355948_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We have two operating segments, which we define as follows: EDG provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	EDG focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO 2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	EDG also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Canvys provides global customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and medical original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) markets.
355948_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions:

355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	As of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2012, our goodwill balance was $1.3 million and represents the premium we paid for Powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the last day of our third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-08 which allows for the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of an operating segment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	We applied this qualitative approach to our EDG operating segment and concluded that indications of impairment were not present as of June 2, 2012.
355948_12_ITEM7_P17_S7	The qualitative factors considered included macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity or reporting unit specific events.
355948_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our intangible asset is the fair value that we determined for customer relationships acquired in connection with the acquisition of Powerlink during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012.
355948_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	The fair value was based upon discounted cash flows that the customer relationships are expected to generate over the next twenty years.

355948_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	There were no changes in judgment during the fiscal year end regarding the beginning-of-year valuation allowance which would require a benefit to be excluded from the annual effective tax rate and allocated to the interim period.
355948_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	As of June 2, 2012, we had no domestic federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards as all NOL carryforwards were fully utilized in the prior year.

355948_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	We also had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward or foreign tax credit carryforwards as of June 2, 2012, as these attributes were also fully utilized in the prior year.
355948_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	Based on this, our future U.S. federal statutory tax rate is expected to be closer to 34%, our state effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 4.5%, and our foreign effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%.

355948_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The final purchase price was subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	On June 29, 2011, we received notification from Arrow seeking a post-closing working capital adjustment, which would reduce the purchase price by approximately $4.2 million.
355948_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	We recorded the working capital adjustment of $4.2 million in our results from discontinued operations during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we agreed to approximately $3.9 million of the proposed working capital adjustment and adjusted our results from discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

355948_12_ITEM7_P26_S5	The cash bonus compensation amount awarded was approximately $3.8 million, and was recorded as expense from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	To help facilitate the transition of RFPD to Arrow, we agreed to provide certain transitional services to Arrow such as financial support services, warehouse services, and access to facilities in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

355948_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, we agreed to manufacture certain products for Arrow.
355948_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	The Transition Services Agreement, which commenced on March 1, 2011, and ended on March 1, 2012, allowed us to exert very limited influence over Arrow s operating and financial policies.
355948_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	The continuing cash flows related to our Transition Services Agreement as well as the Manufacturing Agreement, are insignificant.
355948_12_ITEM7_P27_S7	We believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the Transition Services Agreement that relate to financial support, certain facilities, and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to RFPD.
355948_12_ITEM7_P27_S8	We further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the Manufacturing Agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to RFPD.
355948_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	On May 31, 2007, we completed the sale of the Security Systems Division/Burtek Systems ( SSD/Burtek ) to Honeywell International Inc. ( Honeywell ).
355948_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The sale agreement of SSD/Burtek to Honeywell contemplated a post-closing working capital-based purchase price adjustment.

355948_12_ITEM7_P36_S9	Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities, including our discontinued operations, of $49.4 million during fiscal 2012, was due primarily to the purchase of Powerlink of $2.3 million, and the purchase of $423.6 million in time deposits and CDs, offset by proceeds from time deposits and CDs of $376.6 million.
355948_12_ITEM7_P36_S10	Net cash provided by investing activities, including our discontinued operations, of $160.0 million during fiscal 2011, was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of RFPD of $229.0 million and proceeds of $776.5 million from time deposits and CDs, partially offset by the purchase of $884.9 million in time deposits and CDs, and capital expenditures of $0.5 million for information technology projects and building improvements.
355948_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities, including our discontinued operations, of $26.6 million during fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the repurchase of common stock of $24.0 million, and $3.3 million in cash dividends paid, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $0.8 million.
355948_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Net cash used in financing activities, including our discontinued operations, of $24.5 million during fiscal 2011 was due primarily to the repayment of our short-term debt of $19.5 million, $8.8 million for the repurchase of common stock, and $1.9 million in cash dividends paid, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $5.4 million, and a$0.3 million tax benefit from stock option exercises.
355948_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	Dividend payments during fiscal 2012 were approximately $3.3 million.
355948_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	As of June 2, 2012, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, as we paid down the $22.0 million outstanding balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest during fiscal 2011, and terminated the agreement on February 28, 2011.
355948_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	On June 11, 2010, we redeemed all $19.5 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 7 3 / 4 % Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
355948_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	See Note 8 Debt of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the redemption.
355948_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations by expiration period are presented in the table below as of June 2, 2012 ( in thousands ):
355948_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	(1) Lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	(2) IT services are related to the Transaction.
355948_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	We believe that existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending June 1, 2013.
355948_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations.
355948_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
355948_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1.1 million and $0.4 million as of June 2, 2012, and May 28, 2011, respectively.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S5	In a limited number of cases, we provide and bill our customers with non-product related services, such as testing, calibration, non-recurring engineering, tooling, and installation services.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S6	We have concluded that the service revenue should not be considered a separate unit of accounting from the product sale as we have determined there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S7	We have also concluded that, in the limited cases where remaining obligations exist after delivery of the product, the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory.
355948_12_ITEM7_P47_S8	This conclusion was reached based on the following facts: the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer, which in most cases, is performed immediately after the delivery of the product; the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is minimal, and the costs and time do not vary significantly; we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely; and finally, failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or the service.
355948_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Inventories Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our inventories included $31.8 million of finished goods and $2.9 million of raw materials and work-in-progress.
355948_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain market segments, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.4 million, $1.1 million, and $0.2 million during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	The provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Loss Contingencies We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	See Note 10 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	The amendments to the Codification in ASU No. 2011-12 are effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income , so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 that ASU No. 2011-12 is deferring.
355948_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	In order to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments, the paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-12 supersede certain pending paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to re-deliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.
355948_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	While the FASB is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments, entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.
355948_12_ITEM7_P53_S5	Public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods with those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and as such, we have adopted ASU No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	ASU Update No. 2011-11, requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
355948_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Offsetting, otherwise known as netting, is the presentation of assets and liabilities as a single net amount in the statement of financial position (balance sheet).
355948_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	We will be adopting ASU Update No. 2011-11during our first quarter of fiscal 2014.
355948_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment , ( ASU Update No. 2011-08).
355948_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	ASU Update No. 2011-08 is intended to simplify how entities, both public and nonpublic, test goodwill for impairment.
355948_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	ASU Update No. 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other .
355948_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%.
355948_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	ASU Update No. 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
355948_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment test performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made for issuance.
355948_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	We adopted ASU Update No. 2011-08 during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial results.
355948_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	During May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income, ( ASC Update No. 2011-05 ) .
355948_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	This amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
355948_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
355948_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	ASU Update No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
355948_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
355948_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	ASU Update No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.
355948_12_ITEM7_P58_S6	No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We manage these risks through normal operating activities.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates and interest rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exposure Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We could manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in sales contracts, local debt to offset asset exposures, and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P0_S6	We have not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, or fiscal 2010.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $15.8 million during fiscal 2012 and an estimated $15.9 million during fiscal 2011.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $26.7 million as of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2012, and an estimated $29.4 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $0.5 million as of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2012, and an estimated $1.5 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in interest rates and exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except per share amounts) 1.
355948_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is incorporated in the state of Delaware.

355948_12_ITEM8_P0_S5	Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions.
355948_12_ITEM8_P0_S6	These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
355948_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) for all fiscal years presented.
355948_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries.
355948_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
355948_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	The consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, and our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended May 28, 2011, and May 29, 2010, have been restated to reflect the Transaction.
355948_12_ITEM8_P1_S4	Refer to Note 5 Discontinued Operations of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the sale of RFPD.
355948_12_ITEM8_P1_S5	Our financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, have been restated to reflect a misstatement.
355948_12_ITEM8_P1_S6	Refer to Note 3 Restatement of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on this misstatement.
355948_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	Our fiscal year 2012 began on May 29, 2011, and ended on June 2, 2012.
355948_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	RESTATEMENT During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, in connection with an ongoing IRS examination, we determined that a deduction taken on our fiscal year 2006 federal tax return was taken in error.
355948_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	As a result, the tax impact of the Net Operating Loss ( NOL ) carry forward from fiscal 2006 was overstated by approximately $2.1 million.
355948_12_ITEM8_P3_S2	The NOL from fiscal 2006 was fully utilized and the reversal of all associated valuation allowances was recorded in our results from discontinued operations during fiscal 2011.
355948_12_ITEM8_P3_S3	The deferred tax asset related to the NOL was fully reserved prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 ( SAB 108 ) provides guidance on quantifying and evaluating the materiality of errors.
355948_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	SAB 108 requires that a company considers the iron curtain and the rollover approach when quantifying misstatement amounts.
355948_12_ITEM8_P4_S2	Under the rollover approach, the error is quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated.
355948_12_ITEM8_P4_S3	The iron curtain approach quantifies the error using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluates whether either of these approaches results in quantifying a misstatement that is material, considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.
355948_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	Materiality was also assessed from a qualitative perspective based on whether it was probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item.
355948_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	We do not believe the effect of this error would have changed or influenced the judgment of a reasonable person.
355948_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	We have performed an analysis of this error using both the rollover and iron curtain methods and have concluded that this error is material to our current period s financial statements and immaterial to fiscal 2011 financial statements.
355948_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	Accordingly, we restated our fiscal 2011 financial statements to correct the error in this Form 10-K. This error did not impact the financial statements prior to fiscal 2011, as the NOL was fully reserved prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	During fiscal 2012, the effect on retained earnings and net income were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	The understatement of our income tax accrual as of our fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, affected our consolidated balance sheet as follows ( in thousands ): The understatement of income tax expense for our fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, affected our consolidated statement of operations as follows ( in thousands, except per share data ):
355948_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, loss contingencies and income taxes.
355948_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Our financial instruments include investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.
355948_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	The fair values of these financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values at June 2, 2012, and May 28, 2011.
355948_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1.1 million as of June 2, 2012, and $0.4 million as of May 28, 2011.
355948_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment.
355948_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	As of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2012, our goodwill balance was $1.3 million and represents the premium we paid for Powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_12_ITEM8_P13_S3	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the last day of our third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_12_ITEM8_P13_S4	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_12_ITEM8_P13_S5	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-08 which allows for the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of an operating segment.
355948_12_ITEM8_P13_S6	We applied this qualitative approach to our EDG operating segment and concluded that indications of impairment were not present as of June 2, 2012.

355948_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale.
355948_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
355948_12_ITEM8_P22_S5	Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
355948_12_ITEM8_P22_S6	With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period, and warranty experience.
355948_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
355948_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S5	In a limited number of cases, we provide and bill our customers with non-product related services, such as testing, calibration, non-recurring engineering, tooling, and installation services.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S6	We have concluded that the service revenue should not be considered a separate unit of accounting from the product sale as we have determined there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S7	We have also concluded that, in the limited cases where remaining obligations exist after delivery of the product, the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory.
355948_12_ITEM8_P25_S8	This conclusion was reached based on the following facts: the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer, which in most cases, is performed immediately after the delivery of the product; the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is minimal, and the costs and time do not vary significantly; we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely; and finally, failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or the service.
355948_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.
355948_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_12_ITEM8_P27_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Discontinued Operations: In accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements- Discontinued Operations ( ASC 205-20 ), we reported the financial results of RFPD as a discontinued operation.

355948_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We measure and recognize compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options.
355948_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends.
355948_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Compensation cost is recognized using a graded-vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period, or date on which retirement eligibility is achieved, if shorter (non-substantive vesting period approach).
355948_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	Share-based compensation expense totaled approximately $0.5 million during fiscal 2012, $1.2 million during fiscal 2011, and $0.6 million during fiscal 2010.

355948_12_ITEM8_P34_S3	As of June 2, 2012, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options was approximately $1.7 million which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of five years.
355948_12_ITEM8_P34_S4	The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during fiscal 2012 was $0.8 million.
355948_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience.
355948_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).
355948_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	On December 21, 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 110 stating that they will continue to accept SAB No. 107, past the original expiration date of December 31, 2007.
355948_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	For stock options granted during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, we believe that our historical stock option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
355948_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	We utilized the Safe Harbor option, or Simplified Method, to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with SAB No. 107 for options granted.
355948_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	We intend to continue to utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with SAB No. 110 until such time that we believe that our historical stock option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.
355948_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at June 2, 2012 ( in thousands, except option prices and years ):
355948_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	A summary of restricted stock award transactions was as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	There were no stock awards issued in fiscal 2012.

355948_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Employees 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 750,000 shares as incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or stock awards.
355948_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	Under this plan, 655,000 shares are reserved for future issuance.
355948_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Plan authorizes the granting of stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant.
355948_12_ITEM8_P40_S3	Generally, these options become exercisable over five years and expire up to 10 years from the date of grant.
355948_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	On June 16, 2005, our Board of Directors adopted the 2006 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors which authorizes the issuance of up to 400,000 shares as non-qualified stock options.
355948_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	Under this plan, 185,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for future issuances relating to stock options exercisable based on the passage of time.
355948_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	Each option is exercisable over a period of time from its date of grant at the market value on the grant date and expires after 10 years.
355948_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	This plan replaces the 1996 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors which was terminated on June 16, 2005.
355948_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Earnings per Share: We have authorized 30,000,000 shares of common stock, 10,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
355948_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time.
355948_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
355948_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.
355948_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method as prescribed in ASC 260.
355948_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income, adjusted for interest savings, net of tax, on assumed conversion of convertible debentures and notes, by the actual shares outstanding and share equivalents that would arise from the exercise of stock options, certain restricted stock awards, and the assumed conversion of convertible debentures and notes when dilutive.
355948_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	For fiscal 2010, the assumed conversion and the effect of the interest savings of our 7 3 / 4 % Notes were excluded because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
355948_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	For fiscal 2010, the weighted-average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share is equal to the basic weighted average shares due to the loss from continuing operations during these periods.
355948_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	The per share amounts presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income are based on the following ( amounts in thousands, except per share amounts ):
355948_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Note: Common stock options that were anti-dilutive and not included in diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010 were 272,864, 237,064, and 339,714 respectively.
355948_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The amendments to the Codification in ASU No. 2011-12 are effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income , so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 that ASU No. 2011-12 is deferring.
355948_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	In order to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments, the paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-12 supersede certain pending paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to re-deliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.
355948_12_ITEM8_P49_S3	While the FASB is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments, entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_12_ITEM8_P49_S4	All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.
355948_12_ITEM8_P49_S5	Public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods with those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and as such, we have adopted ASU No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	ASU Update No. 2011-11, requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.

355948_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	ASU Update No. 2011-08 is intended to simplify how entities, both public and nonpublic, test goodwill for impairment.
355948_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	ASU Update No. 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other .
355948_12_ITEM8_P52_S3	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%.
355948_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	ASU Update No. 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
355948_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment test performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made for issuance.
355948_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	We adopted ASU Update No. 2011-08 during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial results.
355948_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	During May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income, ( ASC Update No. 2011-05 ) .
355948_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	This amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
355948_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
355948_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	ASU Update No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
355948_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
355948_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	ASU Update No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.
355948_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.

355948_12_ITEM8_P55_S4	The final purchase price was subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment.
355948_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	On June 29, 2011, we received notification from Arrow seeking a post-closing working capital adjustment, which would reduce the purchase price by approximately $4.2 million.
355948_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	We recorded the working capital adjustment of $4.2 million in our results from discontinued operations during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.

355948_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	Arrow also agreed to provide certain transitional services such as information technology services, warehouse services, and access to facilities and equipment in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	The duration of the transitional services were less than one year from March 1, 2011, except for the information technology services which is three years.

355948_12_ITEM8_P57_S4	Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, we agreed to manufacture certain products for Arrow.
355948_12_ITEM8_P57_S5	The Transition Services Agreement, which commenced on March 1, 2011, and ended on March 1, 2012, allowed us to exert very limited influence over Arrow s operating and financial policies.
355948_12_ITEM8_P57_S6	The continuing cash flows related to our Transition Services Agreement as well as the Manufacturing Agreement, are insignificant.
355948_12_ITEM8_P57_S7	We believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the Transition Services Agreement that relate to financial support, certain facilities, and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to RFPD.
355948_12_ITEM8_P57_S8	We further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the Manufacturing Agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to RFPD.
355948_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	On May 31, 2007, we completed the sale of the Security Systems Division/Burtek Systems ( SSD/Burtek ) to Honeywell International Inc. ( Honeywell ).

355948_12_ITEM8_P66_S9	Pro forma financial information is not presented due to immateriality.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may be occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel, or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S2	As of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2012, our goodwill balance was $1.3 million and represents the premium we paid for Powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S3	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the last day of our third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S4	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S5	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-08, which allows for the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of an operating segment.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S6	We applied this qualitative approach to our EDG operating segment and concluded that indications of impairment were not present as of June 2, 2012.
355948_12_ITEM8_P67_S7	The qualitative factors considered included macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity or reporting until specific events.
355948_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

355948_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	federal statutory rate of 34% during fiscal 2012 and 35% during fiscal 2011 and 2010, primarily results from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses, return to provision adjustments, the release of ASC-740 income tax reserves, and a change in the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested.

355948_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
355948_12_ITEM8_P112_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_12_ITEM8_P112_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

355948_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

355948_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	Continuing global economic pressures resulted in flat sales for fiscal 2012.
355948_12_ITEM15_P37_S3	Despite the economy, we were able to reduce our expenses by approximately $3.5 million, excluding the items previously mentioned.
355948_12_ITEM15_P37_S4	Due to the sales shortfall, we did not achieve our operating margin goal of 5% but believe we are well-positioned to deliver solid operating performance in Fiscal 2013, said Edward J. Richardson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.

355948_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	CASH USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES Total cash and investments as of fiscal year end were $159.6 million reflecting repurchases of approximately 1.9 million shares or cash spent of $24.0 million during the fiscal year.
355948_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	Of the 1.9 million shares, we repurchased 913,779 shares during the fourth quarter using $10.9 million of cash.
355948_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	During our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we have repurchased a total of 2.5 million shares using $32.7 million of our cash.
355948_12_ITEM15_P43_S4	Our balance sheet remains strong and we are carefully evaluating opportunities that will drive our growth.
355948_12_ITEM15_P43_S5	In the meantime, we will return value to our shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases, said Mr. Richardson.
355948_12_ITEM15_P43_S6	As of today, $38.5 million remains under the Company s existing share repurchase authorization from the company s board of directors.
355948_12_ITEM15_P43_S7	This includes an incremental $25 million repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors on July 25, 2012.
355948_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Share repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, subject to market conditions and trading restrictions.
355948_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	This authorization has no expiration and may be cancelled at any time.
355948_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	OUTLOOK The market dynamics for EDG continue to be challenging; however, we are aggressively pursuing areas of growth such as applications which use power grid tubes.
355948_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	We are expanding our service capabilities in Europe and Asia where customers are less likely to have the technical ability to replace tubes.
355948_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	This will enable us to expand our customer base for tubes as well as consumable parts.
355948_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	For Canvys, the North American sales organization continues to win custom display opportunities with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
355948_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	Focusing on OEMs has allowed us to capitalize on what we do best design and deliver engineered solutions based on specific customer requirements, said Mr. Richardson.
355948_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	With the ongoing pressures in the economy, we expect sales for EDG and Canvys for the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $36 to $38 million; we remain optimistic that through our focus on key growth markets we will achieve sales in the range of $170 to $175 million for Fiscal 2013.
355948_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	We will continue to closely manage our expenses and are confident we will be able to deliver on our 5% operating margin goal, concluded Mr. Richardson.
355948_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	INCREASED QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.05 TO $0.06 The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors voted to declare a $0.06 quarterly dividend per share to all holders of common stock and a $0.054 cash dividend per share to all holders of Class B common stock.
355948_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	The dividend will be payable on September 11, 2012, to all common stockholders of record on August 28, 2012.
355948_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company currently has 12,742,748 outstanding shares of common stock and 2,919,961 outstanding shares of Class B common stock.

355948_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Richardson Electronics common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol RELL.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may not achieve our growth, cost-reduction or margin expansion goals.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We have established goals to improve our profitability by growing our sales with new and existing customers, reducing our expenses, and increasing our margins.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to reduce our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:
355948_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our long-term growth objectives.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Our products generally support industrial machinery that is powered by tube technology.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	As technology evolves and this capital equipment is replaced, the market for our products potentially declines.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In addition, the market for many of our other products is characterized by rapid change resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we will be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	This may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face competitive pressures in the markets we serve.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We face many competitors, both global and local, in the markets we serve.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Not only do we compete with other distributors, we also compete for customers with many of our own suppliers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our competition includes hundreds of electronic component distributors of various sizes, locations, and market focuses, as well as original equipment manufacturers and refurbishers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Some of our competitors have greater resources and broader name recognition than we do.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	As a result, these competitors may be able to better withstand changing conditions within our markets and throughout the economy as a whole.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	As of July 22, 2013, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 67% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We depend on key management and employees, the loss of whom may prevent us from implementing our business plans, limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We are dependent on the talent and resources of our key executives and employees.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In particular, the success of our business depends to a great extent on Edward J. Richardson, our President, Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Mr. Richardson has extensive experience in the electron device industry, and his services are critical to our success.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We have not obtained key man insurance with respect to Mr. Richardson or any of our executive officers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The loss of Mr. Richardson may prevent us from implementing our business plan, which may limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	EDG is dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply it with essential products.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	EDG s principal products are vacuum tubes.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	These tubes and certain other products supplied by EDG are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	One of EDG s suppliers represents 16% of our total sales volume.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We believe that some vendors supplying products to EDG product lines are consolidating their distribution relationships as a result of the declining market for vacuum tubes.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	To the extent that our significant suppliers reduce the volume of product they sell through distribution and are unwilling to continue to do business with us, or extend lead times, or limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of unique risks which could impact our results of operations.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, currency fluctuations, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, changes in tax laws and difficulty in staffing global operations.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the U.S. Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Many of our components are sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Additionally, we offer installation and repair services in conjunction with the selling of our components.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Since a defect or failure in a product or service could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages that result.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We extend credit to our customers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management s evaluation of factors which include such things as a customer s financial condition, payment history and the availability of collateral to secure customers receivables.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As part of our growth strategy, our intent is to acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or assets.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our operating results during Fiscal 2013 reflect a decline in sales volume, and there can be no assurance that we will experience a recovery in the near future; nor can there be any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We rely heavily on information technology systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement with Arrow Electronics, Arrow provides IT services to us.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We rely on these information systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	If the IT services provided by Arrow Electronics are not provided to us in an adequate manner, our ability to serve our customers and to perform other vital company functions may be affected.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Arrow s obligation to provide these IT services ends on March 1, 2014, although we have negotiated the right to extend the Agreement.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	migration prior to the termination date of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A significant disruption or failure in the design, implementation or support of the new information technology systems could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or decreased revenues, harm our reputation, or expose us to liability.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	To the extent we cannot timely complete this project, our business may suffer and we may incur significant additional costs.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our management s attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays; or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S8	We may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S10	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S11	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S12	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S13	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P20_S14	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.

355948_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	However, if we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.

355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S6	The $2.7 million decrease includes a $0.1 million reduction of SG A for EDG and a $2.8 million reduction of total company support function costs, due primarily to a reduction in headcount and professional services, partially offset by an increase of SG A costs for Canvys of $0.2 million due primarily to an increase in bad debts from one customer, partially offset by a decrease in salary and severance.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S7	Other (Income) Expense Other (income) expense was income of $0.6 million during fiscal 2013, compared to income of $1.4 million during fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S8	Other (income) expense included a foreign exchange loss of $0.8 million, as compared to a foreign exchange gain of less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S9	Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S10	We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S11	Fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 also included $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of investment income.

355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S13	The change from expense to income during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was due primarily to income from investments of $1.4 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S14	Foreign exchange was a gain of less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to a foreign exchange loss of $0.6 million during fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S15	Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S16	We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S17	We carried no debt and had no redemptions during fiscal 2012, while fiscal 2011 included a loss of $0.1 million related to the redemption of our 7 3 / 4 % convertible senior subordinated notes.
355948_13_ITEM7_P14_S18	Interest expense decreased to less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to $0.1 million during fiscal 2011, due to the full redemption of our convertible notes.

355948_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our income tax benefit for fiscal year 2012 was $0.3 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	During fiscal 2011, we had an income tax provision of $0.5 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	The effective income tax rates for continuing operations during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, were 24.9%, (4.37%), and 19.1%, respectively.
355948_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	The difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% during 2013 and 2012 and 35% during fiscal 2011, resulted from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses, return to provisions adjustments, the release of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, changes in the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested, and changes in valuation allowance.
355948_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	There were no changes in judgment during the fiscal year end regarding the beginning-of-year valuation allowance which would require a benefit to be excluded from the annual effective tax rate and allocated to the interim period.
355948_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	As of June 1, 2013, we had no domestic federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
355948_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.3 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.8 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	We also had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward or foreign tax credit carryforwards as of June 1, 2013.
355948_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	The domestic federal NOL and foreign tax credit generated in fiscal 2013 are expected to be carried back to prior tax years.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income of loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended June 1, 2013.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	On the basis of this evaluation, as of June 1, 2013, a valuation allowance of $7.5 million has been recorded to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where cumulative losses have been incurred, and domestic state NOL carryforwards related to states where the utilization of NOLs have been suspended.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	Our future U.S. federal statutory tax rate is expected to be closer to 34%, our state effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 3.8%, and our foreign effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S6	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $1.7 million, $40.1 million, and $3.4 million during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S7	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent of cash available will be repatriated to the U.S., and accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $6.8 million and $7.6 million as of June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012, respectively, on foreign earnings of $42.6 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P17_S8	In addition, as of June 1, 2013, $36.9 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Due to various tax attributes that are constantly changing, it is not practical to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2005 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, state or local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	During fiscal 2013, we completed federal audits in the U.S. for fiscal 2009, 2010, and 2011.
355948_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	We have tax years open in Germany and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2007.
355948_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Discontinued Operations Arrow Transaction On March 1, 2011, we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of, our RFPD division, as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets, to Arrow in exchange for $238.8 million, which included an estimated pre-closing working capital adjustment of approximately $27.0 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a working capital adjustment of $4.2 million in our results from discontinued operations.
355948_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we paid Arrow $3.9 million to settle the working capital adjustment.
355948_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	Following the Transaction, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted cash bonus compensation to certain executive officers and former employees in recognition of their efforts for successfully completing the Transaction.
355948_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	The cash bonus compensation amount awarded was approximately $3.8 million, and was recorded as expense from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	To help facilitate the transition of RFPD to Arrow, we agreed to provide certain transitional services to Arrow such as financial support services, warehouse services, and access to facilities in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Arrow also agreed to provide certain transitional services such as information technology services, warehouse services, and access to facilities and equipment in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The duration of the transitional services were less than one year from March 1, 2011, except for the information technology services which is three years.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	In addition, we entered into a Manufacturing Agreement with Arrow, in connection with the Transaction, for a term of three years.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, we agreed to manufacture certain products for Arrow.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S5	The Transition Services Agreement, which commenced on March 1, 2011, and ended on March 1, 2012, allowed us to exert very limited influence over Arrow s operating and financial policies.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S6	The continuing cash flows related to our Transition Services Agreement as well as the Manufacturing Agreement, are insignificant.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S7	We believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the Transition Services Agreement that relate to financial support, certain facilities, and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to RFPD.
355948_13_ITEM7_P23_S8	We further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the Manufacturing Agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to RFPD.

355948_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future growth strategies for our remaining business in the foreseeable future.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	The cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from our net income, adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Operating activities, which include our discontinued operations, provided $8.6 million of cash during fiscal 2013.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	We had net income of $1.2 million during fiscal 2013, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards primarily to our directors and officers and depreciation and amortization expense of $1.1 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquired businesses, provided $7.4 million of cash during fiscal 2013, due primarily to the decrease in inventory of $2.5 million, decrease in our accounts receivable of $1.8 million, partially offset by an increase to our prepaid expenses of $0.3 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	The decrease in our inventory was the result of reduced inventory purchases during fiscal 2013 due to the decline in net sales.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S5	The decrease in our receivables of $1.8 million was due primarily to the improvement in our day sales outstanding and lower sales volume.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S6	The increase in prepaid expenses of $0.3 million was due primarily to the renewal of our liability insurance coverage.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S7	Cash used in operating activities, including our discontinued operations, during fiscal 2012 was $48.7 million.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S8	The $48.7 million of cash used in operating activities primarily reflects a decrease of $50.1 million in accrued liabilities, a $5.2 million decrease in long-term tax liabilities, a $6.6 million increase in income tax receivable, and an increase of $4.9 million in inventory, offset by a $5.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S9	The $50.1 million decrease in accrued liabilities, excluding the impact of foreign exchange of $0.8 million, was due primarily to our tax payment related to the sale of RFPD during fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S10	The $5.2 million decrease in long-term tax liabilities, excluding the impact of foreign exchange of $0.3 million, relates primarily to adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes to the amounts of permanently reinvested foreign earnings.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S11	The $6.6 million in income tax receivable relates to an overpayment in our estimated tax during fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S12	The $4.9 million in inventory, excluding the impact of foreign exchange of $1.3 million, was due primarily to increased purchasing to support future sales growth.
355948_13_ITEM7_P34_S13	The $5.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, excluding the impact of foreign exchange of less than $0.1 million, was due primarily to the final payment received of $4.2 million, from Arrow for the sale of RFPD.
355948_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The cash flow from investing activities has consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments and capital expenditures.

355948_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our purchases and proceeds from investments consist of time deposits and CDs.
355948_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates.

355948_13_ITEM7_P38_S8	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_13_ITEM7_P38_S9	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_13_ITEM7_P38_S10	Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations by expiration period are presented in the table below as of June 1, 2013 ( in thousands ):
355948_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	(1) Lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	(2) IT services are related to the Transaction.
355948_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	We believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014.
355948_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and the results of operations.
355948_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
355948_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
355948_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1.1 million as of June 1, 2013, and June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_13_ITEM7_P46_S5	In the limited cases where remaining performance obligations exist after delivery of the product, the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory and is not essential to the functionality of the delivered product.
355948_13_ITEM7_P46_S6	This conclusion was reached based on the following facts: the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer, which in most cases, is performed immediately after the delivery of the product; the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is insignificant in relation to the item sold, and the costs and time do not vary significantly; we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely; and finally, failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or service, and the timing of the payment for the product is not contingent upon completion of remaining performance obligations, if any.
355948_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Inventories Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our inventories included approximately $31.6 million of finished goods and $2.4 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of June 1, 2013, as compared to approximately $31.8 million of finished goods and $2.9 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain market segments, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $1.1 million during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	The provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment.
355948_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	As of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2013, our goodwill balance was $1.5 million and represents the premium we paid for Powerlink of $1.3 million during our second quarter of fiscal 2012, adjusted for foreign currency translation, and the premium we paid for D and C of $0.2 million during our second quarter of fiscal 2013.
355948_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair-value based test, using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_13_ITEM7_P49_S4	In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results, discounted cash flows, and other assumptions.
355948_13_ITEM7_P49_S5	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	The results of our goodwill impairment tests as of March 2, 2013, indicated no goodwill impairment as estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.
355948_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the acquisition of Powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal 2012 and D and C acquired during our second quarter of fiscal 2013.
355948_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_13_ITEM7_P54_S4	See Note 10 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The amendments to the Codification in ASU No. 2011-12 are effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income , so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 that ASU No. 2011-12 is deferring.
355948_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	In order to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments, the paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-12 supersede certain pending paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to re-deliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.
355948_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	While the FASB is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments, entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.
355948_13_ITEM7_P55_S5	Public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods with those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and as such, we have adopted ASU No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	ASU Update No. 2011-11, requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
355948_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Offsetting, otherwise known as netting, is the presentation of assets and liabilities as a single net amount in the statement of financial position (balance sheet).
355948_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	We will be adopting ASU Update No. 2011-11 during our first quarter of fiscal 2014, and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial results.
355948_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	During May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income, ( ASC Update No. 2011-05 ) .
355948_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
355948_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
355948_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	ASU Update No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
355948_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
355948_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	ASU Update No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.

355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	to many different market risks with the various industries we serve.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets, and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exposure Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S7	We could manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in sales contracts, local debt to offset asset exposures, and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P0_S8	We have not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012, or fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $14.1 million during fiscal 2013, an estimated $15.8 million during fiscal 2012, and an estimated $15.7 million during fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $26.1 million as of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2013, and an estimated $26.7 million as of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2012, while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2013, and an estimated $0.5 million as of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors.

355948_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, have been restated to reflect a misstatement.
355948_13_ITEM8_P1_S4	Refer to Note 3 Restatement for additional discussion on this misstatement.
355948_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	Our fiscal year 2013 began on June 3, 2012, and ended on June 1, 2013.
355948_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	3. RESTATEMENT During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, in connection with an ongoing IRS examination, we determined that a deduction taken on our fiscal 2006 federal tax return was taken in error.
355948_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	As a result, the tax impact of the Net Operating Loss ( NOL ) carry forward from fiscal 2006 was overstated by approximately $2.1 million.
355948_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	The NOL from fiscal 2006 was fully utilized and the reversal of all associated valuation allowances was recorded in our results from discontinued operations during fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P3_S3	The deferred tax asset related to the NOL was fully reserved prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 ( SAB 108 ) provides guidance on quantifying and evaluating the materiality of errors.
355948_13_ITEM8_P4_S1	SAB 108 requires that a company considers the iron curtain and the rollover approach when quantifying misstatement amounts.
355948_13_ITEM8_P4_S2	Under the rollover approach, the error is quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated.
355948_13_ITEM8_P4_S3	The iron curtain approach quantifies the error using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluates whether either of these approaches results in quantifying a misstatement that is material, considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.
355948_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	Materiality was also assessed from a qualitative perspective based on whether it was probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item.
355948_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	We do not believe the effect of this error would have changed or influenced the judgment of a reasonable person.
355948_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	We performed an analysis of this error using both the rollover and iron curtain methods and concluded that this error was material to our fiscal 2012 financial statements and immaterial to our fiscal 2011 financial statements.
355948_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	Accordingly, we restated our fiscal 2011 consolidated statement of comprehensive income to correct the error.
355948_13_ITEM8_P6_S2	This error did not impact the financial statements prior to fiscal 2011, as the NOL was fully reserved prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P6_S3	During fiscal 2012, the effect on retained earnings and net income were as follows ( in thousands ): The understatement of income tax expense for our fiscal year ended May 28, 2011, affected our consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows ( in thousands, except per share data ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Our financial instruments include investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.
355948_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	The fair values of these financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values at June 1, 2013, and June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1.1 million as of June 1, 2013, and $1.1 million as of June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Inventories: Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	Our inventories include approximately $31.6 million of finished goods and $2.4 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of June 1, 2013, as compared to approximately $31.8 million of finished goods and $2.9 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $1.1 million during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, which were included in cost of sales from continuing operations.
355948_13_ITEM8_P13_S3	The provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_13_ITEM8_P13_S4	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_13_ITEM8_P14_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Investments: During fiscal 2013, we invested in time deposits and certificate of deposits ( CD ) in the amount of $44.0 million.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Of this, $39.0 million mature in less than twelve months and $5.0 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	As of June 2, 2012, we had approximately $115.3 million invested in time deposits and CD s.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S3	Of this, $105.0 million matures in less than twelve months and $10.3 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S4	The fair value of these investments is the face value of each time deposit and CD.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S5	We also have investments in equity securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S6	Our investments, which are included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.4 million at June 1, 2013, and $0.4 million at June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM8_P15_S7	Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.2 million during fiscal 2013 and $0.2 million during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	We reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
355948_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Net unrealized holding losses during fiscal 2013 were less than $0.1 million, and during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, were $0.1 million or less, and have been included in accumulated comprehensive income (loss) during its respective fiscal year.
355948_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Discontinued Operations: In accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations ( ASC 205-20 ), we reported the financial results of RFPD as a discontinued operation.

355948_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	3 - 10 years Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment.
355948_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	As of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2013, our goodwill balance was $1.5 million and represents the premium we paid for Powerlink of $1.3 million during our second quarter of fiscal 2012, adjusted for foreign currency translation, and the premium we paid for D and C of $0.2 million during our second quarter of fiscal 2013.
355948_13_ITEM8_P23_S3	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair-value based test, using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_13_ITEM8_P23_S4	In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results, discounted cash flows, and other assumptions.
355948_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	The results of our goodwill impairment tests as of March 2, 2013 and March 1, 2012, indicated no goodwill impairment as estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.
355948_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_13_ITEM8_P26_S2	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for customer relationships acquired in connection with the acquisition of Powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal 2012 and D and C acquired during second quarter of fiscal 2013.

355948_13_ITEM8_P27_S5	Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
355948_13_ITEM8_P27_S6	With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period, and warranty experience.
355948_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
355948_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

355948_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We measure and recognize compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options.
355948_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends.
355948_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Compensation cost is recognized using a graded-vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period, or date on which retirement eligibility is achieved, if shorter (non-substantive vesting period approach).

355948_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).

355948_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	For stock options granted during fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, we believe that our historical stock option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
355948_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	We utilized the Safe Harbor option, or Simplified Method, to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with SAB No. 107 for options granted.
355948_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	We intend to continue to utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with SAB No. 110 until such time that we believe that our historical stock option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.

355948_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheet are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period spot rates.
355948_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of stockholders equity.
355948_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the current rate on the date of the transaction.
355948_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	foreign currency transactions are included in income.
355948_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Foreign currency translation reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income was a loss of $0.8 million during fiscal 2013, a gain of less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2012, and a loss of $0.6 million during fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_13_ITEM8_P44_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_13_ITEM8_P44_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_13_ITEM8_P44_S5	In the limited cases where remaining performance obligations exist after delivery of the product, the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory and is not essential to the functionality of the delivered product.
355948_13_ITEM8_P44_S6	This conclusion was reached based on the following facts: the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer, which in most cases, is performed immediately after the delivery of the product; the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is insignificant in relation to the item sold, and the costs and time do not vary significantly; we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely; and finally, failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or service, and the timing of the payment for the product is not contingent upon completion of remaining performance obligations, if any.
355948_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.
355948_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Earnings per Share: We have authorized 30,000,000 shares of common stock, 10,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
355948_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time.
355948_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
355948_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.
355948_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method as prescribed in ASC 260.
355948_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	The per share amounts presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income are based on the following ( amounts in thousands, except per share amounts ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Note: Common stock options that were anti-dilutive and not included in diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012, and fiscal 2011 were 280,764, 272,864, and 237,064, respectively.
355948_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	The amendments to the Codification in ASU No. 2011-12 are effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income , so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 that ASU No. 2011-12 is deferring.
355948_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	In order to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments, the paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-12 supersede certain pending paragraphs in ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to re-deliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.
355948_13_ITEM8_P51_S3	While the FASB is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments, entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05.
355948_13_ITEM8_P51_S4	All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.
355948_13_ITEM8_P51_S5	Public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods with those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and as such, we have adopted ASU No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	ASU Update No. 2011-11, requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
355948_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Offsetting, otherwise known as netting, is the presentation of assets and liabilities as a single net amount in the statement of financial position (balance sheet).
355948_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	We will be adopting ASU Update No. 2011-11 during our first quarter of fiscal 2014, and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial results.
355948_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	During May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income, ( ASC Update No. 2011-05 ) .
355948_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	This amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
355948_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
355948_13_ITEM8_P54_S3	ASU Update No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
355948_13_ITEM8_P54_S4	The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
355948_13_ITEM8_P54_S5	ASU Update No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.
355948_13_ITEM8_P54_S6	No. 2011-05 during our third quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Arrow Transaction On March 1, 2011, we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of, our RFPD division, as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets, to Arrow in exchange for $238.8 million, which included an estimated pre-closing working capital adjustment of approximately $27.0 million.
355948_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a working capital adjustment of $4.2 million in our results from discontinued operations.
355948_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we paid Arrow $3.9 million to settle the working capital adjustment.
355948_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Following the Transaction, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted cash bonus compensation to certain executive officers and former employees in recognition of their efforts for successfully completing the Transaction.
355948_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	The cash bonus compensation amount awarded was approximately $3.8 million, and was recorded as expense from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	To help facilitate the transition of RFPD to Arrow, we agreed to provide certain transitional services to Arrow such as financial support services, warehouse services, and access to facilities in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	Arrow also agreed to provide certain transitional services such as information technology services, warehouse services, and access to facilities and equipment in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	The duration of the transitional services were less than one year from March 1, 2011, except for the information technology services which is three years.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	In addition, we entered into a Manufacturing Agreement with Arrow, in connection with the Transaction, for a term of three years.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S4	Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, we agreed to manufacture certain products for Arrow.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S5	The Transition Services Agreement, which commenced on March 1, 2011, and ended on March 1, 2012, allowed us to exert very limited influence over Arrow s operating and financial policies.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S6	The continuing cash flows related to our Transition Services Agreement as well as the Manufacturing Agreement are insignificant.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S7	We believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the Transition Services Agreement that relate to financial support, certain facilities, and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to RFPD.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S8	We further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the Manufacturing Agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to RFPD.
355948_13_ITEM8_P57_S9	Financial Summary - Discontinued Operations Summary financial results for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 are presented in the following table ( in thousands ): Notes:

355948_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	6. ACQUISITIONS On September 5, 2011, we acquired the assets of Powerlink Specialist Electronics Support Limited ( Powerlink ) for approximately $2.3 million, including a working capital adjustment of $0.2 million related to payables of approximately $0.2 million that were paid by Powerlink prior to the close.
355948_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	Powerlink, a UK-based technical service company with locations in London and Dubai, services traveling wave tube ( TWT ) amplifiers and related equipment for the Satellite Communications market throughout Europe and the Middle East.
355948_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	This acquisition positions us to provide cost-effective service of microwave and power grid tube equipment for communications, industrial, military, and medical users around the world.
355948_13_ITEM8_P66_S3	The allocation of the final purchase price, recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2012, included $0.4 million of trade receivables, $0.2 million of inventory, $0.4 million of other intangibles, and $1.4 million of goodwill, based on foreign currency exchange rates as of September 5, 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P66_S4	The goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of the identifiable net assets we acquired.

355948_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	intangibles, and $0.2 million of goodwill.
355948_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	The purchase price is preliminary and subject to change based on the completion of a valuation of the respective assets, which include intangible assets and liabilities.
355948_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	Pro forma financial information is not presented due to immateriality.
355948_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment.
355948_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	As of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2013, our goodwill balance was $1.5 million and represents the premium we paid for Powerlink of $1.3 million during our second quarter of fiscal 2012, adjusted for foreign currency translation, and the premium we paid for D and C of $0.2 million during our second quarter of fiscal 2013.
355948_13_ITEM8_P70_S3	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair-value based test, using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_13_ITEM8_P70_S4	In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results, discounted cash flows, and other assumptions.
355948_13_ITEM8_P70_S5	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	The results of our goodwill impairment tests as of March 2, 2013, and March 1, 2012, indicated no goodwill impairment as estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.
355948_13_ITEM8_P71_S3	Changes in the carrying value of goodwill are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

355948_13_ITEM8_P74_S2	Under the terms of the Transaction, Arrow assumed many of our facility leases and we are sub-leasing space from Arrow.
355948_13_ITEM8_P74_S3	Our future lease commitments for minimum rentals, including common area maintenance charges and property taxes during the next five years have been adjusted to reflect the Transaction as follows (in thousands) :
355948_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	The components of income (loss) before income taxes are ( in thousands ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rate of 34% during fiscal 2013 and 2012 and 35% during fiscal 2011 as a result of the following items: The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% during fiscal 2013 due to our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses, the release of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, changes in the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested, and changes in valuation allowance.
355948_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	There were no changes in judgment during the fiscal year end regarding the beginning-of-year valuation allowance.
355948_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
355948_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect continuing operations as of June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012.
355948_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	Significant components are as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	As of June 1, 2013, we had no domestic federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
355948_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	Domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.3 million.
355948_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.8 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_13_ITEM8_P79_S3	We also had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward or foreign tax credit carryforwards as of June 1, 2013.
355948_13_ITEM8_P79_S4	The domestic federal NOL and foreign tax credit generated in fiscal 2013 are expected to be carried back to prior tax years.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended June 1, 2013.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	On the basis of this evaluation, as of June 1, 2013, a valuation allowance of $7.5 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where cumulative losses have been incurred, and domestic state NOL carryforwards related to states where the utilization of NOLs have been suspended.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S4	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S5	Our future U.S. federal statutory tax rate is expected to be closer to 34%, our state effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 3.8%, and our foreign effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S6	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $1.7 million, $40.1 million, and $3.4 million during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S7	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent of cash available will be repatriated to the U.S., and accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $6.8 million and $7.6 million as of June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012, respectively, on foreign earnings of $42.6 million.
355948_13_ITEM8_P80_S8	In addition, as of June 1, 2013, $36.9 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practical to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2005 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, state or local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	During fiscal 2013, we completed federal audits in the U.S. for fiscal 2009, 2010, and 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	We have tax years open in Germany and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2007.
355948_13_ITEM8_P84_S2	The uncertain tax positions as of June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012, totaled $0.03 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
355948_13_ITEM8_P84_S3	No unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.
355948_13_ITEM8_P84_S4	The following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits ( in thousands ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits for continuing and discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands): We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
355948_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
355948_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	As of June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012, we recorded a liability for interest and penalties of $0.04 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

355948_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	The profit sharing plan has a 401(k) provision whereby we match 50% of employee contributions up to 4.0% of pay.
355948_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	Charges to expense for matching contributions to this plan were $0.2 million during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively.
355948_13_ITEM8_P88_S2	There were no matching contributions during fiscal 2011.
355948_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	Foreign employees are covered by a variety of government mandated programs.
355948_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	In accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , we have identified two reportable segments: EDG and Canvys.

355948_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	EDG focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO 2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_13_ITEM8_P91_S2	EDG also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	Canvys provides global customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and OEM markets.
355948_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	The CEO evaluates performance and allocates resources primarily based on the gross profit of each segment.
355948_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	Operating results by segment are summarized in the following table ( in thousands ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	A reconciliation of assets to the relevant consolidated amount is as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	(1) Other current assets include miscellaneous receivables, prepaid expenses, and current deferred income taxes.

355948_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	While the outcome of litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on information available at the time the financial statements were issued, we determined disclosure of contingencies relating to any of our pending judicial proceedings was not necessary because there was less than a reasonable possibility that a material loss had been incurred.
355948_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
355948_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
355948_13_ITEM8_P102_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
355948_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	As of June 1, 2013, we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
355948_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	Our investments consist of time deposits and CDs, which face value is equal to fair value, and equity securities of publicly traded companies for which market prices are readily available.
355948_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012, were as follows ( in thousands ):

355948_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
355948_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
355948_13_ITEM8_P111_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_13_ITEM8_P111_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. at June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 1, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

355948_13_ITEM8_P112_S1	Richardson Electronics Ltd. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

355948_13_ITEM8_P112_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
355948_13_ITEM8_P112_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
355948_13_ITEM8_P112_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
355948_13_ITEM8_P112_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
355948_13_ITEM8_P113_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_13_ITEM8_P113_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_13_ITEM8_P113_S4	In our opinion, Richardson Electronics, Ltd. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2013, based on the COSO criteria .
355948_13_ITEM8_P113_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. as of June 1, 2013 and June 2, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 1, 2013, of Richardson Electronics, Ltd., and our report dated July 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
355948_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of June 1, 2013.
355948_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
355948_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 1, 2013.
355948_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
355948_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
355948_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2013, based on the framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).

355948_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	Fiscal 2013 Results Net sales for fiscal 2013 were $141.1 million, a 10.6% decrease compared to net sales of $157.8 million in the prior year.
355948_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	Gross margin was down slightly at 29.5% during fiscal 2013, compared to 29.6% during fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM15_P44_S2	Operating expenses were $41.5 million, compared to $40.6 million during fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM15_P44_S3	Operating income for fiscal 2013 was breakeven, compared to operating income for fiscal 2012 of $6.3 million.
355948_13_ITEM15_P44_S4	The operating income for fiscal 2013 included $1.2 million of employee-related termination costs and $1.0 million of unabsorbed labor and overhead costs.
355948_13_ITEM15_P44_S5	Net income for fiscal 2013 was $1.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, compared to net income for fiscal 2012 of $8.5 million or $0.50 per diluted common share.
355948_13_ITEM15_P44_S6	Net income for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 includes income from discontinued operations of $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively.

355948_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Unfortunately we did not see the global economic recovery we had expected in fiscal 2013, which resulted in lower-than-anticipated demand for replacement tubes particularly in the semiconductor wafer fabrication, textile, and wood drying markets.
355948_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	In addition, we experienced a drop in demand for medical monitors due to uncertainties surrounding healthcare reform, which had a negative impact on capital spending by our customers.
355948_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	As a result, we did not achieve our operating margin goal of 5%.
355948_13_ITEM15_P45_S3	Throughout the year we took steps to reduce our costs, and we continue to evaluate our resources to ensure maximum efficiency without putting the Company at risk of losing talented people or missing key opportunities for growth, said Edward J. Richardson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.
355948_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $35.2 million, down 9.5%, compared to net sales of $38.9 million during the fourth quarter of last year.

355948_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $1.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
355948_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Net loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was $0.2 million, compared to net income of $2.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted common share, in the prior year s fourth quarter.
355948_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	CASH USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES Total cash and investments as of fiscal year end were $146.0 million reflecting repurchases of approximately 1.3 million shares for approximately $15.0 million during the fiscal year.
355948_13_ITEM15_P51_S2	Of the 1.3 million shares, we repurchased 300,000 shares during the fourth quarter using $3.5 million of cash.
355948_13_ITEM15_P51_S3	During our fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we have repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares using $39.0 million of our cash.
355948_13_ITEM15_P51_S4	Our financial position provides flexibility as we carefully evaluate opportunities that will drive our future growth.
355948_13_ITEM15_P51_S5	While growth initiatives remain an integral part of our strategy, we will return value to our shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases, said Mr. Richardson.
355948_13_ITEM15_P51_S6	As of today, $25.5 million remains under the Company s existing share repurchase authorization from the company s Board of Directors.
355948_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Share repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, subject to market conditions and trading restrictions.
355948_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	This authorization has no expiration and may be cancelled at any time.
355948_13_ITEM15_P52_S2	We are cautiously optimistic that the global economy is stabilizing, and we are beginning to see increased demand for our products in the key markets we serve, said Mr. Richardson.
355948_13_ITEM15_P52_S3	We expect sales for EDG and Canvys for the first quarter of Fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $35 to $37 million.
355948_13_ITEM15_P52_S4	For fiscal 2014, we anticipate sales to be in the range of $155 to $160 million, with operating margin improving to the 5% level in the fourth quarter, and 3% for the fiscal year.
355948_13_ITEM15_P52_S5	We are not satisfied with this level of growth or return.
355948_13_ITEM15_P52_S6	We will continue to actively pursue acquisitions which leverage our existing global infrastructure and capitalize on our strength of serving a diverse end-user community, concluded Mr. Richardson.

355948_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Geography We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions:
355948_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 is set forth in Note 10 Segment and Geographic Information of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have two operating segments, which we define as follows: Electron Device Group Electron Device Group ( EDG ) provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	EDG focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO 2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	EDG also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	EDG represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and industrial power applications.
355948_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Among the suppliers they support are Amperex, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, National, NJRC, Thales, Toshiba, and Vishay.
355948_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	EDG's inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment.
355948_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	As of May 31, 2014 , on average, we hold 120 days of inventory in the normal course of operations.
355948_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	This level of inventory reflects the fact that EDG also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology.
355948_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, EDG is increasing its market share.
355948_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	EDG often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases.
355948_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	As manufacturers for these products exit the business, EDG has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
355948_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	EDG has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights which often include global responsibility.
355948_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches which are not cured within a reasonable period of time.
355948_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	Although some of these agreements allow EDG to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case EDG may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
355948_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	EDG's suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to EDG by its customers.
355948_14_ITEM1_P10_S4	For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including: Amperex , Cetron , and National .
355948_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators, and liquid crystal display monitors.
355948_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics, and a wide variety of fabricated metal components.
355948_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.
355948_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Canvys Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") markets.

355948_14_ITEM1_P13_S5	As a longtime provider of healthcare solutions to hospitals and medical clinics, we specialize in creating comprehensive solutions for diagnostic and clinical review, 3-D and post processing, surgical suites and modality-specific applications.
355948_14_ITEM1_P13_S6	Our solutions meet certifications and calibration standards for patient monitoring, bio-medical displays, ultrasound, cardiac imaging, picture archiving, and communications systems.
355948_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	We offer our picture archiving communication system ( PACS ) and patient monitoring displays under our own brand, Image Systems .
355948_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	We have long-standing relationships with key component and finished goods manufacturers including 3M, HP, IBM, Intel, LG, NEC Displays, Sharp Electronics, Samsung, and WIDE Corporation.
355948_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	We believe our distributor relationships, combined with our engineering design and manufacturing capabilities and private label partnerships, allow us to maintain a well-balanced and technologically advanced offering of customer specific display solutions.

355948_14_ITEM1_P19_S4	The foregoing information regarding our website is provided for convenience and the content of our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may not achieve our growth, margin expansion or cost-reduction goals.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have established goals to improve our profitability by growing our sales with new and existing customers, reducing our expenses, and increasing our margins.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to reduce our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:
355948_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our long-term growth objectives.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Our products generally support industrial machinery that is powered by tube technology.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	As technology evolves and this capital equipment is replaced, the market for our products potentially declines.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In addition, the market for many of our other products is characterized by rapid change resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we will be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	This may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face competitive pressures in the markets we serve.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	There are very few vacuum tube competitors in the markets EDG serves.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	There are also a limited number of Chinese manufacturers whose ability to produce vacuum tubes has progressed over the past several years.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The most significant competitive risk comes from technical obsolescence.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Canvys faces many competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As of July 22, 2014, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 65% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We depend on key management and employees, the loss of whom may prevent us from implementing our business plans, limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We are dependent on the talent and resources of our key executives and employees.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In particular, the success of our business depends to a great extent on Edward J. Richardson, our President, Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Mr. Richardson has extensive experience in the electron device industry, and his services are critical to our success.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We have not obtained key man insurance with respect to Mr. Richardson or any of our executive officers.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	The loss of Mr. Richardson may prevent us from implementing our business plan, which may limit our profitability and decrease the value of our common stock.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	EDG is dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply it with essential products.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	EDG s principal products are capacitors, vacuum tubes and related products, microwave generators, and high voltage power supplies.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The products supplied by EDG are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	One of EDG s suppliers represents 17% of our total sales volume.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We believe that some vendors supplying products to EDG product lines are consolidating their distribution relationships as a result of the declining market.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	To the extent that our significant suppliers reduce the volume of product they sell through distribution and are unwilling or unable to continue to do business with us, or extend lead times, or limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of unique risks which could impact our results of operations.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, currency fluctuations, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, changes in tax laws, and difficulty in staffing global operations.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the U.S. Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the base currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We rely heavily on information technology systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement with Arrow Electronics, Arrow provides IT services to us.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We rely on these information systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S7	If the IT services provided by Arrow Electronics are not provided to us in an adequate manner, our ability to serve our customers and to perform other vital company functions may be affected.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S8	On July 8, 2014, we received notice from Arrow that it will cease to provide these IT services as of January 8, 2015.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P11_S9	We are in the process of migrating to a new ERP platform with the intent of completing the migration prior to January 8, 2015.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	A significant disruption or failure in the design, implementation or support of the new information technology systems could significantly disrupt our business, result in increased costs or decreased revenues, harm our reputation, or expose us to liability.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	To the extent we cannot timely complete this project, our business may suffer and we may incur significant additional costs.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Many of our components are sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Since a defect or failure in a product could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We extend credit to our customers.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management s evaluation of factors which include such things as a customer s financial condition, payment history, and the availability of collateral to secure customers receivables.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As part of our growth strategy, our intent is to acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition, and integrating the operations, personnel and systems of the acquired businesses.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our operating results during fiscal 2014 reflect a decline in sales volume, and there can be no assurance that we will experience a recovery in the near future; nor can there be any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our management s attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S6	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We may have to stop selling certain products or certain technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P21_S10	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We currently have significant cash and investments.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The company's identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We ascribe value to certain intangible assets, which consist of customer lists and trade names resulting from acquisitions.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We may incur an impairment charge on intangible assets if we determine that the fair value of the intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We evaluate whether events have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of intangible assets may no longer be recoverable.
355948_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If this is the case, an impairment charge to earnings would be necessary.
355948_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facility locations, their primary use, and segments served are as follows:
355948_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	* LaFox, Illinois is also the location of our corporate headquarters.
355948_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Dividends Our quarterly dividend was $0.06 per common share and $0.054 per Class B common share.
355948_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Annual dividend payments for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were approximately $3.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively.
355948_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ) under the trading symbol ( RELL ).
355948_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.
355948_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	As of July 21, 2014, there were approximately 721 stockholders of record for the common stock and approximately 16 stockholders of record for the Class B common stock.

355948_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	The difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% during 2014, 2013, and 2012 resulted from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses, return to provision adjustments, the release of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, changes in the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested, and changes in valuation allowance.
355948_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	There were no changes in judgment during the fiscal year end regarding the beginning-of-year valuation allowance which would require a benefit to be excluded from the annual effective tax rate and allocated to the interim period.

355948_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended May 31, 2014 .
355948_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	On the basis of this evaluation, as of May 31, 2014 , a valuation allowance of $4.1 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized.
355948_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred, and domestic state NOL carryforwards related to jurisdictions where the utilization of NOLs have been suspended.
355948_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.

355948_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) Lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	(2) IT services are related to the Transaction.
355948_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	We believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending May 30, 2015.
355948_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and the results of operations.
355948_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
355948_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
355948_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.6 million as of May 31, 2014 , and $1.1 million as of June 1, 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Inventories Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our inventories included approximately $30.9 million of finished goods and $3.0 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of May 31, 2014 , as compared to approximately $31.6 million of finished goods and $2.4 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of June 1, 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain market segments, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.8 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million during fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	The provisions were primarily for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment.
355948_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair-value based test, using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_14_ITEM7_P46_S4	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our goodwill impairment testing follows the two-step process as defined in ASC 350.
355948_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
355948_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized.
355948_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from the first step of the evaluation is allocated to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in order to determine an implied goodwill value.
355948_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	This allocation is similar to the purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting.
355948_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	If the carrying amount of the goodwill reported exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
355948_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal 2012 and D and C acquired during our second quarter of fiscal 2013.
355948_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Intangible assets fully relate to our EDG segment.
355948_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Long-Lived Assets We review property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	When only a range of possible losses can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	See Note 8 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.
355948_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	This ASU standardizes the reporting for these awards by requiring that entities treat these performance targets as a performance condition.
355948_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
355948_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
355948_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	For all entities, ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015; early adoption is permitted.
355948_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-11 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
355948_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
355948_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period; early adoption is not permitted.
355948_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
355948_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.
355948_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	This ASU limits discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results.
355948_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	In addition, the amendments in this ASU require expanded disclosures for discontinued operations as well as for disposals that do not qualify as discontinued operations.
355948_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	For public entities, ASU 2014-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
355948_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Early adoption is permitted for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued.
355948_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-08 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
355948_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	We have evaluated and adopted the guidance of the following ASUs issued by the FASB in 2013; adopting these ASUs did not materially impact the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures:
355948_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	ASU No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists issued in July 2013.
355948_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	ASU 2013-11 standardizes the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists; it does not require new recurring disclosures.
355948_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	ASU 2013-11 requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward unless specific criteria exist, in which case the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets .
355948_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity issued in March 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	ASU 2013-05 provides guidance on releasing cumulative translation adjustments ( CTA ) when an entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity, and also provides guidance on releasing CTA in partial sales of equity method investments and in step acquisitions.
355948_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation is Fixed at the Reporting Date issued in February 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The guidance in ASU 2013-04 requires entities to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, for which the total obligation amount is fixed at the reporting date, as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount it expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors.
355948_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	ASU 2013-04 also specifies disclosure requirements.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets, and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exposure Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements, denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency, are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S7	We could manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in sales contracts, local debt to offset asset exposures, and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P0_S8	We have not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2014 , fiscal 2013 , or fiscal 2012 .
355948_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $13.8 million during fiscal 2014 , an estimated $14.1 million during fiscal 2013 , and an estimated $15.8 million during fiscal 2012 .
355948_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $26.8 million as of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , and an estimated $26.1 million as of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2013 , while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $0.7 million as of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , and an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except per share amounts) 1.

355948_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for all fiscal years presented.
355948_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries.
355948_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
355948_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our fiscal year 2014 began on June 2, 2013, and ended on May 31, 2014 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P2_S4	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Our financial instruments include investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.
355948_14_ITEM8_P4_S2	The fair values of these financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values at May 31, 2014 , and June 1, 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_14_ITEM8_P6_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.6 million as of May 31, 2014 , and $1.1 million as of June 1, 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_14_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheet are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period spot rates.
355948_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of stockholders equity.
355948_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the current rate on the date of the transaction.
355948_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.
355948_14_ITEM8_P11_S4	Foreign currency translation reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) was a loss of $0.1 million during fiscal 2014, a loss of $0.8 million during fiscal 2013, and a gain of less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2012.
355948_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.
355948_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Inventories: Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Our inventories include approximately $30.9 million of finished goods and $3.0 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of May 31, 2014 , as compared to approximately $31.6 million of finished goods and $2.4 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of June 1, 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.8 million , $0.4 million , and $0.4 million during fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, which were included in cost of sales from continuing operations.
355948_14_ITEM8_P14_S3	The provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_14_ITEM8_P14_S4	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_14_ITEM8_P15_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Investments: During fiscal 2014 , we invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit ( CD ) in the amount of $32.7 million .
355948_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Of this, $31.7 million mature in less than twelve months and $1.0 million mature in greater than twelve months.

355948_14_ITEM8_P16_S4	The fair value of these investments is the face value of each time deposit and CD.
355948_14_ITEM8_P16_S5	We also have investments in equity securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
355948_14_ITEM8_P16_S6	Our investments, which are included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.5 million at May 31, 2014 , and $0.4 million at June 1, 2013 .

355948_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair-value based test, using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_14_ITEM8_P19_S4	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.

355948_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
355948_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience.
355948_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).
355948_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	On December 21, 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 110 stating that they will continue to accept SAB No. 107, past the original expiration date of December 31, 2007.
355948_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	For stock options granted during fiscal years 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , we believe that our historical stock option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
355948_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	We utilized the Safe Harbor option, or Simplified Method, to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with SAB No. 107 for options granted.
355948_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	We intend to continue to utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with SAB No. 110 until such time that we believe that our historical stock option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.
355948_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at May 31, 2014 ( in thousands, except option prices and years ):
355948_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	As of May 31, 2014, we had zero unvested restricted shares compared to 10,000 unvested restricted shares as of June 1, 2013.

355948_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
355948_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.
355948_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method as prescribed in ASC 260.
355948_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.

355948_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	This ASU standardizes the reporting for these awards by requiring that entities treat these performance targets as a performance condition.
355948_14_ITEM8_P48_S2	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
355948_14_ITEM8_P48_S3	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.

355948_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-08 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
355948_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	We have evaluated and adopted the guidance of the following ASUs issued by the FASB in 2013; adopting these ASUs did not materially impact the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures:

355948_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	In calculating the fair value for our reporting units, we performed extensive valuation analysis, utilizing both income and market approaches.
355948_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the fair value of our EDG reporting unit:
355948_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	Income Approach : To determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, we discount the expected cash flows which are developed by management.
355948_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	We estimate our future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our views of growth rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.
355948_14_ITEM8_P71_S2	To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our models, we use a terminal value approach and incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value.
355948_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Market-Based Approach : To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using several market-based approaches, including the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar publicly traded companies.
355948_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	The results of our goodwill impairment tests as of March 1, 2014, indicated that the value of goodwill attributed to our EDG segment was fully impaired.
355948_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	Certain indicators existed to suggest our EDG reporting unit was at risk of its carrying value exceeding its fair value.
355948_14_ITEM8_P74_S4	This included a reduction in the EDG core business as well as a reduction in our forecasted financial results due to the uncertainty with our growth initiatives.
355948_14_ITEM8_P74_S5	As a result, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $1.7 million .
355948_14_ITEM8_P74_S6	Additionally, a $0.4 million tax benefit was recorded related to the goodwill impairment.
355948_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the acquisition of Powerlink during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and the acquisition of D and C during the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
355948_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	Intangible assets subject to amortization as well as amortization expense are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	We determined that other intangibles were not impaired on the basis of the future undiscounted cash flows expected.
355948_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	The amortization expense associated with the intangible assets subject to amortization for the next five years is presented in the following table (in thousands) :
355948_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	The weighted average number of years of amortization expense remaining is 16.9 years.
355948_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	We lease certain warehouse and office facilities and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	Rent expense from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 was $1.5 million , $1.6 million , and $1.6 million , respectively.
355948_14_ITEM8_P80_S2	Under the terms of the Transaction, Arrow assumed many of our facility leases and we are sub-leasing space from Arrow.
355948_14_ITEM8_P80_S3	Our future lease commitments for minimum rentals, including common area maintenance charges and property taxes during the next five years have been adjusted to reflect the Transaction as follows (in thousands) :
355948_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	Income (loss) before income taxes includes the following components ( in thousands ):
355948_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 consists of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The differences between income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 34% and the reported income tax provision (benefit) for fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 are summarized as follows:
355948_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
355948_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect continuing operations as of May 31, 2014 and June 1, 2013 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	Significant components are as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	As of May 31, 2014 , we had no domestic federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
355948_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	Domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.3 million .
355948_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	Foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $1.1 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_14_ITEM8_P85_S3	We also had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward or foreign tax credit carryforwards as of May 31, 2014 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P85_S4	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $7.0 million and $6.8 million as of May 31, 2014 and June 1, 2013 , respectively, on foreign earnings of $41.3 million .
355948_14_ITEM8_P85_S5	In addition, as of May 31, 2014, $45.4 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practical to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended May 31, 2014 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P87_S2	On the basis of this evaluation, as of May 31, 2014 , a valuation allowance of $4.1 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_14_ITEM8_P87_S3	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred, and domestic state NOL carryforwards related to jurisdictions where the utilization of NOLs have been suspended.
355948_14_ITEM8_P87_S4	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_14_ITEM8_P87_S5	Our future U.S. federal, state, and foreign effective tax rates are expected to be closer to 34.0% , 3.8% , and 27.3% , respectively.
355948_14_ITEM8_P87_S6	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $2.1 million , $1.7 million , and $40.1 million during fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
355948_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2005 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, state or local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_14_ITEM8_P88_S2	We are also currently under examination in Germany (fiscal 2009, 2010, and 2011), Italy (fiscal 2011), and Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011).
355948_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2007 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2008.
355948_14_ITEM8_P89_S2	The uncertain tax positions as of May 31, 2014 and June 1, 2013 , totaled $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million , respectively.
355948_14_ITEM8_P89_S3	Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.2 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.
355948_14_ITEM8_P89_S4	The following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits ( in thousands ):
355948_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits for continuing and discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):

355948_14_ITEM8_P91_S2	As of May 31, 2014 and June 1, 2013 , we recorded a liability for interest and penalties of $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million , respectively.
355948_14_ITEM8_P91_S3	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next 12 months.
355948_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Employee Profit Sharing Plan: The employee profit sharing plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan for employees.
355948_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	The profit sharing plan has a 401(k) provision whereby we match 50% of employee contributions up to 4.0% of pay.
355948_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	Charges to expense for matching contributions to this plan were $0.3 million during fiscal 2014 and $0.2 million during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 , respectively.
355948_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	In accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , we have identified two reportable segments: EDG and Canvys.
355948_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	EDG provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.

355948_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	We are involved in several pending judicial proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
355948_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	While the outcome of litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on information available at the time the financial statements were issued, we determined disclosure of contingencies relating to any of our pending judicial proceedings was not necessary because there was less than a reasonable possibility that a material loss had been incurred.
355948_14_ITEM8_P101_S2	During fiscal 2014, we received settlements in the amount of $2.5 million related to an antitrust class action lawsuit settlement.
355948_14_ITEM8_P101_S3	The settlement was recorded as proceeds from legal settlement within the Other Income section of our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
355948_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
355948_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
355948_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
355948_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	As of May 31, 2014 , we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
355948_14_ITEM8_P103_S1	Our investments consist of time deposits and CDs, where face value is equal to fair value, and equity securities of publicly traded companies for which market prices are readily available.
355948_14_ITEM8_P103_S2	Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of May 31, 2014 and June 1, 2013 , were as follows ( in thousands ):

355948_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Richardson Electronics, Ltd.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. as of May 31, 2014 , and June 1, 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2014 .
355948_14_ITEM8_P106_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
355948_14_ITEM8_P106_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
355948_14_ITEM8_P106_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

355948_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
355948_14_ITEM8_P107_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
355948_14_ITEM8_P107_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_14_ITEM8_P107_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. at May 31, 2014 , and June 1, 2013 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_14_ITEM8_P107_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Richardson Electronics Ltd s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated July 25, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
355948_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Richardson Electronics, Ltd.: We have audited Richardson Electronics Ltd. s, internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
355948_14_ITEM8_P108_S1	Richardson Electronics Ltd. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
355948_14_ITEM8_P108_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
355948_14_ITEM8_P108_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
355948_14_ITEM8_P108_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
355948_14_ITEM8_P108_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
355948_14_ITEM8_P108_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_14_ITEM8_P109_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
355948_14_ITEM8_P109_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_14_ITEM8_P109_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_14_ITEM8_P109_S4	In our opinion, Richardson Electronics, Ltd. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria .
355948_14_ITEM8_P109_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. as of May 31, 2014 , and June 1, 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2014 , of Richardson Electronics, Ltd., and our report dated July 25, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
355948_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of May 31, 2014 .
355948_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
355948_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2014 .
355948_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
355948_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
355948_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2014 , based on the framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
355948_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2014 .

355948_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair.
355948_14_ITEM15_P40_S3	More information is available online at www.rell.com .
355948_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Richardson Electronics common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol RELL.
355948_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high value displays, flat panel detector solutions and replacement parts for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions.
355948_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets.
355948_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	The Company s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
355948_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions.
355948_15_ITEM1_P0_S5	These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
355948_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare ("Healthcare").
355948_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEM") and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile healthcare industry.
355948_15_ITEM1_P2_S4	Our fiscal year 2015 began on June 1, 2014, and ended on May 30, 2015 .
355948_15_ITEM1_P2_S5	Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Geography We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions:
355948_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 is set forth in Note 10 Segment and Geographic Information of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Electron Device Group ( EDG ) provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	EDG focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO 2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	EDG also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	EDG represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and industrial power applications.
355948_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Among the suppliers they support are Amperex, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, National, NJRC, Thales, Toshiba, and Vishay.
355948_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	EDG's inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment.
355948_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	On average, we hold 120 days of inventory in the normal course of operations.
355948_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	This level of inventory reflects the fact that EDG also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology.
355948_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, EDG is increasing its market share.
355948_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	EDG often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases.
355948_15_ITEM1_P7_S5	As manufacturers for these products exit the business, EDG has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
355948_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	EDG has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights which often include global responsibility.
355948_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches which are not cured within a reasonable period of time.
355948_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	Although some of these agreements allow EDG to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case EDG may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
355948_15_ITEM1_P8_S3	EDG's suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to EDG by its customers.
355948_15_ITEM1_P8_S4	For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including: Amperex , Cetron , and National .
355948_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators, and liquid crystal display monitors.
355948_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics, and a wide variety of fabricated metal components.
355948_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.

355948_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	International Sales During fiscal 2015 , approximately 56% of our sales were made outside the U.S.
355948_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	We continue to pursue new international sales to further expand our geographic reach.
355948_15_ITEM1_P15_S4	As of May 30, 2015 , we employed 338 full-time individuals.
355948_15_ITEM1_P15_S5	Of these, 220 were located in the United States and 118 were located internationally.
355948_15_ITEM1_P15_S6	The worldwide employee base included 155 in sales and product management and an additional 183 employees in distribution support, administrative positions, and value-add and manufacturing.
355948_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	All of our employees are non-union, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
355948_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Website Access to SEC Reports We maintain an Internet website at www.rell.com .
355948_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 are accessible through our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

355948_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may not achieve our plan for sales growth and margin targets.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have established both margin and expense targets to grow our sales with new and existing customers.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to leverage our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:
355948_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our growth objectives.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Our products generally support industrial machinery that is powered by tube technology.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	As technology evolves and this capital equipment is replaced, the market for our products potentially declines.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In addition, the market for many of our other products is characterized by rapid change resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we may be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	This may result in a decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We face competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	There are very few vacuum tube competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	There are also a limited number of Chinese manufacturers whose ability to produce vacuum tubes has progressed over the past several years.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The most significant competitive risk comes from technical obsolescence.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Canvys faces many competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	As we expand our business and pursue our growth initiatives, we may encounter increased competition from current and/or new competitors.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	As of July 22, 2015, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 65% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply us with essential products.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our principal products are capacitors, vacuum tubes and related products, microwave generators, and high voltage power supplies.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The products we supply are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	One of our suppliers represents 17% of our total sales volume.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	To the extent that our significant suppliers are unwilling or unable to continue to do business with us, or extend lead times, or limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of risks which could impact our results.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, and changes in tax laws.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the United States.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the base currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We rely heavily on information technology systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We rely on our information systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase, manufacture, and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	A significant disruption or failure in the design, implementation or support of our new information technology systems could significantly disrupt our business, result in increased costs or decreased revenues, harm our reputation, or expose us to liability.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Many of our components are sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S9	Since a defect or failure in a product could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S10	While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P7_S11	Our business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We extend credit to our customers.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management s evaluation of factors which include such things as a customer s financial condition, payment history, and the availability of collateral to secure customers receivables.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As part of our growth strategy, our intent is to acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition, and integrating the operations, personnel and systems of the acquired businesses.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our operating results during fiscal 2015 reflect a decline in sales volume, and there can be no assurance that we will experience a recovery in the near future; nor can there be any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	From time to time, third parties, including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers, may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our management s attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S7	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S9	We may have to stop selling certain products or certain technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S11	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S12	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S13	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S14	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P16_S15	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We currently have significant cash and investments.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We ascribe value to certain intangible assets, which consist of customer lists and trade names resulting from acquisitions.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We may incur an impairment charge on goodwill or on intangible assets if we determine that the fair value of the intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We evaluate whether events have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may no longer be recoverable.
355948_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If this is the case, an impairment charge to earnings would be necessary.
355948_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facility locations, their primary use, and segments served are as follows:
355948_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	* LaFox, Illinois is also the location of our corporate headquarters.
355948_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Dividends Our quarterly dividend was $0.06 per common share and $0.054 per Class B common share.
355948_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Annual dividend payments for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were approximately $3.3 million per year.
355948_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_15_ITEM5_P0_S3	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.

355948_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare ("Healthcare").
355948_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEM") and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.

355948_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	investment income of $1.3 million, partially offset by a foreign exchange loss of $0.8 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities.
355948_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.
355948_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our income tax benefit from continuing operations during fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 was $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
355948_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our income tax provision for fiscal year 2013 was $0.2 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	The effective income tax rates for continuing operations during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, were (20.9)%, (47.0)%, and 24.9%, respectively.
355948_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	The difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% during 2015, 2014, and 2013 resulted from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses, return to provision adjustments, the release of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, changes in the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested, and changes in valuation allowance.
355948_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	As of May 30, 2015, we had approximately $3.0 million of federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
355948_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.4 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.6 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	We also have $0.3 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of May 30, 2015.
355948_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of May 30, 2015.
355948_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $4.8 million and $7.0 million as of May 30, 2015 and May 31, 2014, respectively, on foreign earnings of $37.2 million and $41.3 million, respectively.
355948_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	In addition, as of May 30, 2015, $33.7 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended May 30, 2015.
355948_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	On the basis of this evaluation, as of May 30, 2015, a valuation allowance of $5.2 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings, and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.5 million, $2.1 million, and $1.7 million during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
355948_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2005 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, state or local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	We are also currently under examination in Germany (fiscal 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011).
355948_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2008 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2009.
355948_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The uncertain tax positions as of May 30, 2015 and May 31, 2014, totaled $2.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
355948_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.1 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.
355948_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Discontinued Operations During fiscal year 2011, we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of our RF, Wireless, and Power Division ("RFPD"), as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets, to Arrow Electronics, Inc.

355948_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Cash Flows from Operating Activities Negative cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
355948_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Operating activities, which include our discontinued operations, used $9.8 million of cash during fiscal 2015.
355948_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	We had net loss of $5.6 million during fiscal 2015, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards primarily to our directors and officers and depreciation and amortization expense of $1.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets.

355948_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	This increase is primarily due to increases in our accounts receivable of $4.5 million and inventory purchases of $7.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in our income tax receivable of $2.0 million and an increase in our accounts payable of $4.2 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P37_S5	The increase in inventory and accounts payable relates to additional purchases to support our engineered solutions and healthcare growth initiatives.

355948_15_ITEM7_P37_S10	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquired businesses, provided $2.6 million of cash during fiscal 2014, due primarily to the decrease in our income tax receivable of $3.5 million, decrease in inventory of $1.5 million, partially offset by a decrease to our accounts payable of $2.1 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P37_S11	The decrease in our inventory was the result of reduced inventory purchases during fiscal 2014 due to the decline in net sales.
355948_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The cash flow from investing activities has consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments and capital expenditures.
355948_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $6.9 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	This included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $33.6 million, offset by the purchase of investments of $35.6 million, and $4.7 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to a new ERP system implementation.
355948_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $7.6 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	This included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $342.3 million, offset by the purchase of investments of $331.0 million, $1.0 million for the acquisition of WVS, and $2.8 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to a new ERP system implementation.
355948_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	Our purchases and proceeds from investments consist of time deposits and CDs.
355948_15_ITEM7_P38_S6	Purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
355948_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The cash flow from financing activities primarily consists of repurchases of common stock and cash dividends paid.
355948_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $6.9 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	This included $3.9 million of cash used to repurchase common stock and $3.3 million in dividends paid, offset by $0.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises.
355948_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	The repurchase of common stock relates to our share repurchase authorizations.
355948_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	Cash dividends paid of $3.3 million were approved by the Board of Directors.
355948_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	Cash used in financing activities was $11.9 million during fiscal 2014 .
355948_15_ITEM7_P39_S6	This included $8.7 million related to the repurchases of common stock and $3.3 million in cash dividends paid, offset by $0.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises.
355948_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The repurchase of common stock relates to our share repurchase authorizations.
355948_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Cash dividends paid of $3.3 million were approved by the Board of Directors.
355948_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Dividend payments during fiscal 2015 were approximately $3.3 million.
355948_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations by expiration period are presented in the table below as of May 30, 2015 ( in thousands ):
355948_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	(1) Lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	We believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending May 28, 2016.
355948_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and the results of operations.
355948_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
355948_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
355948_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.3 million as of May 30, 2015 , and $0.6 million as of May 31, 2014 .
355948_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Inventories Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our inventories included approximately $33.7 million of finished goods and $5.1 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of May 30, 2015 , as compared to approximately $30.9 million of finished goods and $3.0 million of raw materials and work-in-progress as of May 31, 2014 .
355948_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain market segments, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.2 million, $0.8 million, and $0.4 million during fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	The provisions were primarily for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair-value based test, using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our goodwill impairment testing follows the two-step process as defined in ASC 350.
355948_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
355948_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized.
355948_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from the first step of the evaluation is allocated to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in order to determine an implied goodwill value.
355948_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	This allocation is similar to the purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting.
355948_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	If the carrying amount of the goodwill reported exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
355948_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal 2012 and D and C acquired during our second quarter of fiscal 2013.
355948_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	Intangible assets fully relate to our EDG segment.
355948_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Long-Lived Assets We review property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	When only a range of possible losses can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	See Note 8 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
355948_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period; early adoption is not permitted.
355948_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets, and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exposure Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements, denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency, are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S7	We could manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in sales contracts, local debt to offset asset exposures, and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P0_S8	We have not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2015 , fiscal 2014 , or fiscal 2013 .
355948_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $9.6 million during fiscal 2015 , an estimated $13.8 million during fiscal 2014 , and an estimated $14.1 million during fiscal 2013 .
355948_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $23.1 million as of the fiscal year ended May 30, 2015 , and an estimated $26.8 million as of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended May 30, 2015 , and an estimated $0.7 million as of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 .
355948_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except per share amounts) 1.

355948_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare ("Healthcare").
355948_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Healthcare was previously included in our Canvys business unit.
355948_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEM") and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile healthcare industry.
355948_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have three operating segments, which we define as follows: Electron Device Group ("EDG"), renamed Power and Microwave Technologies Group in July 2015, provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	EDG focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_15_ITEM8_P4_S2	EDG also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_15_ITEM8_P4_S3	In July 2015, EDG was re-named Power and Microwave Technologies Group.
355948_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, industrial, and OEM markets.
355948_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	Healthcare manufactures, distributes and services high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers.
355948_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	Products include power grid tubes, hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; Image Systems medical displays and workstations for picture archiving and communication systems ("PACS"); visual solutions for operating rooms/surgical environments; digital radiography solutions including replacement flat panel detectors and upgrades; and additional replacement components currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.
355948_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
355948_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for all fiscal years presented.
355948_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries.
355948_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
355948_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	The fiscal 2013 statement of comprehensive income (loss) has been revised to correct a typographical error.
355948_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	The previously reported Foreign currency translation and Fair value adjustment losses of $1.5 million and $30 thousand should have been reflected as gains of $1.5 million and $30 thousand , respectively.
355948_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	As a result, fiscal 2013 comprehensive income has been revised to $2.8 million of income from the previously reported loss of $0.3 million .
355948_15_ITEM8_P10_S3	The error had no impact on consolidated Balance Sheet, Statement of Stockholders Equity, or Statement of Cash Flows.
355948_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	Our fiscal year 2015 began on June 1, 2014, and ended on May 30, 2015 .
355948_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	Our financial instruments include investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.
355948_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	The fair values of these financial instruments approximate carrying values at May 30, 2015 , and May 31, 2014 .
355948_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.3 million as of May 30, 2015 , and $0.6 million as of May 31, 2014 .
355948_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_15_ITEM8_P19_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheet are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period spot rates.
355948_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of stockholders equity.

355948_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	In performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_15_ITEM8_P28_S3	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.

355948_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience.
355948_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).

355948_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	In calculating the fair value for our reporting units, we performed extensive valuation analysis, utilizing both income and market approaches.
355948_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the fair value of our EDG reporting unit:
355948_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Income Approach : To determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, we discount the expected cash flows which are developed by management.
355948_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	We estimate our future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our views of growth rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.
355948_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our models, we use a terminal value approach and incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value.
355948_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Market-Based Approach : To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using several market-based approaches, including the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar publicly traded companies.
355948_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	We did not have any goodwill on our balance sheet as of May 30, 2015.
355948_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	The results of our goodwill impairment tests as of March 1, 2014, indicated that the value of goodwill attributed to our EDG segment was fully impaired.
355948_15_ITEM8_P75_S2	Certain indicators existed to suggest our EDG reporting unit was at risk of its carrying value exceeding its fair value.
355948_15_ITEM8_P75_S3	This included a reduction in the EDG core business as well as a reduction in our forecasted financial results due to the uncertainty with our growth initiatives.
355948_15_ITEM8_P75_S4	As a result, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $1.7 million .

355948_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	Our future lease commitments for minimum rentals, including common area maintenance charges and property taxes during the next five years have been adjusted to reflect the Transaction as follows (in thousands) :
355948_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Income (loss) before income taxes includes the following components ( in thousands ):
355948_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 consists of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	The differences between income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 34% and the reported income tax provision (benefit) for fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 are summarized as follows:
355948_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
355948_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect continuing operations as of May 30, 2015 and May 31, 2014 .
355948_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	Significant components are as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	As of May 30, 2015 , we had approximately $3.0 million of federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards.
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	Domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.4 million .
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	Foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.6 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	We also have $0.3 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of May 30, 2015 .
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S4	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of May 30, 2015.
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S5	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $4.8 million and $7.0 million as of May 30, 2015 and May 31, 2014 , respectively, on foreign earnings of $37.2 million and $41.3 million , respectively.
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S6	In addition, as of May 30, 2015, $33.7 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_15_ITEM8_P86_S7	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three -year period ended May 30, 2015 .
355948_15_ITEM8_P87_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_15_ITEM8_P87_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_15_ITEM8_P87_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_15_ITEM8_P87_S5	On the basis of this evaluation, as of May 30, 2015 , a valuation allowance of $5.2 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings, and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.5 million , $2.1 million , and $1.7 million during fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
355948_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2005 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, state or local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_15_ITEM8_P90_S2	We are also currently under examination in Germany (fiscal 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011).
355948_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2008 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2009.
355948_15_ITEM8_P91_S2	The uncertain tax positions as of May 30, 2015 and May 31, 2014 , totaled $2.0 million and $0.2 million , respectively.
355948_15_ITEM8_P91_S3	Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.1 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.
355948_15_ITEM8_P91_S4	The following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits ( in thousands ):
355948_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits for continuing and discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):
355948_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	(1) Relates to an amended state income tax return We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
355948_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
355948_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	We have not recorded a liability for interest and penalties as of May 30, 2015, and less than $0.1 million , of interest and penalties was recorded during May 31, 2014.
355948_15_ITEM8_P93_S3	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next 12 months.
355948_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	Employee Profit Sharing Plan: The employee profit sharing plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan for employees.
355948_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The profit sharing plan has a 401(k) provision whereby we match 50% of employee contributions up to 4.0% of pay.
355948_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	Charges to expense for matching contributions to this plan were $0.3 million , $0.3 million , and $0.2 million , during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
355948_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Healthcare.
355948_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with OEM and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_15_ITEM8_P96_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high growth, high profile healthcare industry.
355948_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	In accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , we have identified three reportable segments: EDG and Canvys, and Healthcare.

355948_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	EDG focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_15_ITEM8_P98_S2	EDG also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_15_ITEM8_P98_S3	In July 2015, EDG was re-named Power and Microwave Technologies Group.
355948_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, industrial, and OEM markets.
355948_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Healthcare manufactures, distributes and services high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers.

355948_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	While the outcome of litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on information available at the time the financial statements were issued, we determined disclosure of contingencies relating to any of our pending judicial proceedings was not necessary because there was less than a reasonable possibility that a material loss had been incurred.
355948_15_ITEM8_P108_S2	During fiscal 2014, we received settlements in the amount of $2.5 million related to an antitrust class action lawsuit settlement.
355948_15_ITEM8_P108_S3	The settlement was recorded as proceeds from legal settlement within the Other Income section of our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
355948_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
355948_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
355948_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
355948_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	As of May 30, 2015 , we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
355948_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	Our investments consist of time deposits and CDs, where face value is equal to fair value, and equity securities of publicly traded companies for which market prices are readily available.
355948_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of May 30, 2015 and May 31, 2014 , were as follows ( in thousands ):

355948_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	Richardson Electronics, Ltd. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
355948_15_ITEM8_P128_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
355948_15_ITEM8_P128_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
355948_15_ITEM8_P128_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
355948_15_ITEM8_P128_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
355948_15_ITEM8_P128_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
355948_15_ITEM8_P128_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_15_ITEM8_P129_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
355948_15_ITEM8_P129_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_15_ITEM8_P129_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_15_ITEM8_P129_S4	In our opinion, Richardson Electronics, Ltd. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 30, 2015, based on the COSO criteria .
355948_15_ITEM8_P129_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. as of May 30, 2015 and the related consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended and our report dated July 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
355948_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of May 30, 2015 .
355948_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
355948_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 30, 2015 .

355948_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high value displays, flat panel detector solutions and replacement parts for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions.
355948_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets.
355948_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	The Company s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
355948_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions.
355948_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
355948_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare ( Healthcare ).
355948_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEM ) and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile healthcare industry.
355948_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our fiscal year 2016 began on May 31, 2015, and ended on May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
355948_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 is set forth in Note 11 Segment and Geographic Information of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
355948_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ), launched in July 2015, combines Electron Device Group s ( EDG ) core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies.
355948_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	As a manufacturer and authorized distributor, PMT s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair all through our existing global infrastructure.
355948_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	PMT s focus is on products for power, RF and microwave applications for customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	PMT represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and industrial power applications.
355948_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	Among the suppliers they support are Amperex, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, MaCom, National, NJRC, Thales, Toshiba, and Vishay.
355948_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	PMT s inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment.
355948_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	PMT also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology.
355948_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, PMT is increasing its market share.
355948_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	PMT often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases.
355948_16_ITEM1_P11_S4	As manufacturers for these products exit the business, PMT has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
355948_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	PMT has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights which often include global responsibility.
355948_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches which are not cured within a reasonable period of time.
355948_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Although some of these agreements allow PMT to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case PMT may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
355948_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	PMT s suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to PMT by its customers.
355948_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including: Amperex , Cetron , and National .
355948_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators, and liquid crystal display monitors.
355948_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics, and a wide variety of fabricated metal components.
355948_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.
355948_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and medical original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) markets.
355948_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our engineers design, manufacture, source, and support a full spectrum of solutions to match the needs of our customers.
355948_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	We offer custom display solutions that include touch screens, protective panels, custom enclosures, specialized cabinet finishes, and application specific software packages.
355948_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our volume commitments are much lower than those of the large display manufacturers, making us the ideal choice for companies with very specific design requirements.
355948_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	We partner with both private label manufacturing companies and leading branded hardware vendors to offer the high quality liquid crystal displays, mounting devices, and customized computing platforms.
355948_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We have long-standing relationships with key component and finished goods manufacturers including 3M, LG, NEC Displays, and several key Asian display manufacturers that manufacture products to our specifications.
355948_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe supplier relationships, combined with our engineering design and manufacturing capabilities and private label partnerships, allow us to maintain a well-balanced and technologically advanced offering of customer specific display solutions.
355948_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Healthcare, included in Canvys prior to fiscal year 2015, manufactures, distributes and services high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers.
355948_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Products include power grid tubes, hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; Image Systems medical displays and workstations for picture archiving and communication systems ( PACS ); visual solutions for operating rooms/surgical environments; digital radiography solutions including replacement flat panel detectors and upgrades; and additional replacement components currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.
355948_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	As of the end of fiscal 2016, we employed 179 sales and product management personnel worldwide.
355948_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	In addition, we have authorized representatives, who are not our employees, selling our products primarily in regions where we do not have a direct sales presence.
355948_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	We offer various credit terms to qualifying customers as well as cash in advance and credit card terms.
355948_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	We establish credit limits for each customer and routinely review delinquent and aging accounts.
355948_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We maintain approximately 110,700 part numbers in our product inventory database and we estimate that more than 90% of orders received by 6:00 p.m. local time are shipped complete the same day if product is in stock.
355948_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Customers can access our products on our web sites, www.rell.com , www.rellhealthcare.com, www.canvys.com, and www.rellaser.com, through electronic data interchange, or by telephone.
355948_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	Customer orders are processed by our regional sales offices and supported primarily by one of our distribution facilities in LaFox, Illinois; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Marlborough, Massachusetts; Plymouth, Minnesota; Donaueschingen, Germany; or Singapore, Singapore.
355948_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	We also have satellite warehouses in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Shanghai, China; Bangkok, Thailand; and Hook, United Kingdom.
355948_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our data processing network provides on-line, real-time interconnection of all sales offices and central distribution operations, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
355948_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	Information on stock availability, pricing in local currency, cross-reference information, customers, and market analyses are obtainable throughout the entire distribution network.
355948_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	During fiscal 2016, approximately 54% of our sales were made outside the U.S.
355948_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	We continue to pursue new international sales to further expand our geographic reach.
355948_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	As of May 28, 2016, we employed 373 full-time individuals.
355948_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Of these, 241 were located in the United States and 132 were located internationally.
355948_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	The worldwide employee base included 179 in sales and product management and an additional 194 employees in distribution support, administrative positions, and value-add and manufacturing.
355948_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	All of our employees are non-union, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
355948_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We maintain an Internet website at www.rell.com .
355948_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 are accessible through our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
355948_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Interactive Data Files pursuant to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T, of these filing dates, formatted in Extensible Business Reporting Language ( XBRL ) are accessible as well.
355948_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	To access these reports, go to our website at www.rell.com .
355948_16_ITEM1_P27_S4	The foregoing information regarding our website is provided for convenience and the content of our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should consider carefully the following risk factors in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we believe are applicable to our businesses and the industries in which we operate.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our businesses, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We may not achieve our plan for sales growth and margin targets.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have established both margin and expense targets to grow our sales with new and existing customers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to leverage our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:
355948_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our growth objectives.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our products generally support industrial machinery that is powered by tube technology.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As technology evolves and this capital equipment is replaced, the market for our products potentially declines.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, the market for many of our other products is characterized by rapid change resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we may be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	This may result in a decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We face competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	There are very few vacuum tube competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	There are also a limited number of Chinese manufacturers whose ability to produce vacuum tubes has progressed over the past several years.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The most significant competitive risk comes from technical obsolescence.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Canvys faces many competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As we expand our business and pursue our growth initiatives, we may encounter increased competition from current and/or new competitors.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	As of July 25, 2016, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 66% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We are dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply us with essential products.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our principal products are capacitors, vacuum tubes and related products, microwave generators, and high voltage power supplies.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The products we supply are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	One of our suppliers represents 11% of our total sales volume.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	To the extent that our significant suppliers are unwilling or unable to continue to do business with us, or extend lead times, or limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of risks which could impact our results.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, and changes in tax laws.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the United States.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the base currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund U.S. operations or strategic opportunities may be restricted or may subject us to a significant tax liability.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As of May 28, 2016, $52.7 million of cash, cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Some of these subsidiaries are located in jurisdictions which require foreign government approval before a cash repatriation can occur.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, under current tax law, repatriation of this cash may trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the U.S.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives, such as stock repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and other strategic opportunities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we are unable to, or choose not to, repatriate our overseas cash.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders ownership interests in us.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Furthermore, lenders may not agree to extend us new, additional or continuing credit.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In a non-binding referendum on the United Kingdom s membership in the European Union in June 2016, a majority of those who voted approved the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Any withdrawal by the United Kingdom from the European Union ( Brexit ) would occur after, or possible concurrently with, a process of negotiation regarding the future terms of the United Kingdom s relationship with the European Union, which could result in the United Kingdom losing access to certain aspects of the single EU market and the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The Brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the European Union, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, political systems or financial institutions and the financial and monetary system.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Given that we conduct a substantial portion of our business in the European Union, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	The uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit could also have a negative impact on the growth of the European economy and cause greater volatility in all of the global currencies that we currently use to transact business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely heavily on information technology systems which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We rely on our information technology systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase, manufacture, and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	A significant disruption or failure in the design, operation, security or support of our information technology systems could significantly disrupt our business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our information technology systems may be subject to cyber attacks, security breaches or computer hacking.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and its data, as well as the data of our business partners.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The costs to mitigate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about us, our business partners or other third parties could expose us to significant potential liability and reputational harm.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	As threats related to cyber attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our profitability.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	As a global enterprise, we could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Many of our components are sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Since a defect or failure in a product could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We extend credit to our customers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management s evaluation of factors which include such things as a customer s financial condition, payment history, and the availability of collateral to secure customers receivables.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Failure to successfully implement our growth initiatives, or failure to realize the benefits expected from these initiatives if implemented, may create ongoing operating losses or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our growth strategy focuses on expanding our healthcare and our power conversion businesses.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	On June 15, 2015, we acquired certain assets, including inventory, receivables, fixed assets, and certain other assets, of International Medical Equipment and Services, Inc. ( IMES ), for a purchase price of $12.2 million.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In July 2015, we launched Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ), which combines our core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may be unable to implement our growth initiatives or reach profitability in the near future or at all, due to many factors, including factors outside of our control.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If our investments in these growth initiatives do not yield anticipated returns for any reason, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As part of our growth strategy, our intent is to acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition, and integrating the operations, personnel and systems of the acquired businesses.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our operating results during fiscal 2016 reflect an increase in our net loss.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	There can be no assurance that we will experience a recovery in the near future; nor is there any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	From time to time, third parties, including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers, may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our management s attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We may have to stop selling certain products or certain technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We currently have significant cash and investments.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The company s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We ascribe value to certain intangible assets, which consist of customer lists and trade names resulting from acquisitions.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We may incur an impairment charge on goodwill or on intangible assets if we determine that the fair value of the intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	We evaluate whether events have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may no longer be recoverable.
355948_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	If this is the case, an impairment charge to earnings would be necessary.
355948_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns two facilities and leases 30 facilities.
355948_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own our corporate facility and largest distribution center, which is located on approximately 100 acres in LaFox, Illinois and consists of approximately 242,000 square feet of manufacturing, warehouse, and office space.
355948_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We maintain geographically diverse facilities because we believe this provides value to our customers and suppliers, and limits market risk and exchange rate exposure.
355948_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	We consider our properties to be well maintained, in sound condition, and adequate for our present needs.
355948_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	The extent of utilization varies from property to property and from time to time during the year.
355948_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our facility locations, their primary use, and segments served are as follows:
355948_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	* LaFox, Illinois is also the location of our corporate headquarters.
355948_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we or our subsidiaries are involved in pending judicial proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business.
355948_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	While the outcome of litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on information at the time the financial statements were issued, we do not believe that the outcome of any current claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets, and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements, denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency, are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in certain sales contracts and we also have local debt to offset asset exposures.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We have not used any derivative instruments nor entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, or fiscal 2014.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $9.9 million during fiscal 2016, an estimated $9.6 million during fiscal 2015, and an estimated $13.8 million during fiscal 2014.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $6.5 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2016, and an estimated $23.1 million as of the fiscal year ended May 30, 2015, while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2016, and an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our quarterly dividend was $0.06 per common share and $0.054 per Class B common share.
355948_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Annual dividend payments for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015 were approximately $3.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_16_ITEM5_P0_S3	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ) under the trading symbol ( RELL ).
355948_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.
355948_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	As of July 25, 2016, there were approximately 576 stockholders of record for the common stock and approximately 16 stockholders of record for the Class B common stock.
355948_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low closing sales price per share of RELL common stock as reported on the NASDAQ for the periods indicated.

355948_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
355948_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Net sales by segment and percent change for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	During fiscal 2016 consolidated net sales increased by 3.7% compared to fiscal 2015.

355948_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross profit reflects the distribution and manufacturing product margin less manufacturing variances, inventory obsolescence charges, customer returns, scrap and cycle count adjustments, engineering costs, unabsorbed manufacturing labor and overhead, and other provisions.
355948_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Consolidated gross profit was $44.8 million during fiscal 2016, compared to $41.1 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.6% during fiscal 2016, from 30.0% during fiscal 2015.

355948_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities.

355948_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our income tax provision from continuing operations during fiscal year 2016 was $0.5 million.
355948_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Our income tax benefit for fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 was $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The effective income tax rates for continuing operations during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, were 8.8%, (20.9)%, and (47.0)%, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	The difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% during 2016, 2015, and 2014 is primarily driven by the impact of recording a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets, changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss), repatriation of foreign earnings, and our recording of uncertain tax positions with respect to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	As of May 28, 2016, we had approximately $5.7 million of net deferred tax assets for federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards, compared to $3.0 million as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Net deferred tax assets for domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.7 million, compared to $2.4 million during fiscal year 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.6 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	The amount of net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was the same as the fiscal year 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	We also have a net deferred tax asset of $0.3 million related to foreign tax credit carryforwards as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	The changes in balances from prior year for the federal NOL carryforwards is driven by current year forecast taxable losses.
355948_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $6.7 million and $4.8 million as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015, respectively, on foreign earnings of $48.7 million and $38.2 million, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The increase year over year primarily relates to the change in management s assertion for RELL China.
355948_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	As of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we changed our assertion to no longer be permanently reinvested in China.
355948_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	In addition, as of May 28, 2016, $5.7 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	As of May 28, 2016, a valuation allowance of $5.9 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	There has been an increase in the valuation allowance from May 30, 2015 in the amount of $0.7 million.
355948_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions relates to jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings, and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.7 million, $0.5 million, and $2.1 million, during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

355948_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	The uncertain tax positions from continuing operations as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015, totaled $0.1 million.
355948_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

355948_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.4 million as of May 28, 2016, and $0.3 million as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Our inventories included approximately $40.0 million of finished goods, $4.4 million of raw materials, and $1.0 million of work-in-progress as of May 28, 2016, as compared to approximately $33.7 million of finished goods, $3.2 million of raw materials, and $1.9 million of work-in-progress as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain market segments, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.7 million, $0.2 million, and $0.8 million during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The provisions were primarily for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in ASU 2011-08 we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
355948_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	We estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_16_ITEM7_P83_S3	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Our goodwill impairment testing follows the two-step process as defined in ASC 350.
355948_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	The first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
355948_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized.
355948_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from the first step of the evaluation is allocated to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in order to determine an implied goodwill value.
355948_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	This allocation is similar to the purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting.
355948_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	If the carrying amount of the goodwill reported exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
355948_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and technology acquired in connection with the acquisitions.
355948_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	We review property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	When only a range of possible losses can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_16_ITEM7_P93_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_16_ITEM7_P93_S4	See Note 9 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
355948_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period; early adoption is not permitted.
355948_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
355948_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
355948_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
355948_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
355948_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
355948_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
355948_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
355948_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	ASU 2015-11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g., first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value.
355948_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
355948_16_ITEM7_P100_S3	The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory.
355948_16_ITEM7_P100_S4	However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice.
355948_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 , Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , eliminating the current requirement for companies to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent.
355948_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	Instead, companies will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
355948_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_16_ITEM7_P102_S3	The adoption of this guidance will result in a balance sheet reclassification and require related disclosure revisions in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
355948_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	ASU 2016-09 introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.
355948_16_ITEM7_P103_S2	Specifically, the ASU requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
355948_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.
355948_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period.
355948_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	That is, off balance sheet accounting for net operating losses stemming from excess tax benefits would no longer be required and instead such net operating losses would be recognized when they arise.
355948_16_ITEM7_P104_S3	Existing net operating losses that are currently tracked off balance sheet would be recognized, net of a valuation allowance if required, through an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.
355948_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Entities will no longer need to maintain and track an APIC pool.
355948_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.
355948_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	In addition, ASU 2016-09 elevates the statutory tax withholding threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction(s).
355948_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	The ASU also clarifies that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity.
355948_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	ASU 2016-09 provides an optional accounting policy election (with limited exceptions), to be applied on an entity-wide basis, to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (consistent with existing U.S. GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur.
355948_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high value displays, flat panel detector solutions and replacement parts for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions.
355948_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	The Company s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_16_ITEM8_P0_S3	The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
355948_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions.
355948_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
355948_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare ( Healthcare ).
355948_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Healthcare was previously included in our Canvys business unit.
355948_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEM ) and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_16_ITEM8_P3_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile healthcare industry.
355948_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
355948_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	Electron Device Group ( EDG ), renamed Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ) in July 2015, provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_16_ITEM8_P5_S2	PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, industrial, and OEM markets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	Healthcare manufactures, distributes and services high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers.
355948_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	Products include power grid tubes, hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; Image Systems medical displays and workstations for picture archiving and communication systems ( PACS ); visual solutions for operating rooms/surgical environments; digital radiography solutions including replacement flat panel detectors and upgrades; and additional replacement components currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.
355948_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
355948_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	One customer represented $3.8 million, or 15%, of our total accounts receivable balance, as of May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	This receivable was collected in the first month of our fiscal year 2017.
355948_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	For the fiscal year ended May 30, 2015, the Company did not have any specific customer receivable balance that exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable.
355948_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	Supplier Concentration: One of our suppliers represented 11% of our total sales volume as of May 28, 2016, and 17% as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount owed to this supplier was approximately $2.2 million as of May 28, 2016, and $1.2 million as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for all fiscal years presented.
355948_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries.
355948_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
355948_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	Our fiscal year 2016 began on May 31, 2015, and ended on May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	Our financial instruments include investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.
355948_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	The fair values of these financial instruments approximate carrying values at May 28, 2016, and May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.4 million as of May 28, 2016, and $0.3 million as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheet are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period spot rates.
355948_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of stockholders equity.
355948_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the current rate on the date of the transaction.
355948_16_ITEM8_P23_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.
355948_16_ITEM8_P23_S4	Foreign currency translation reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) was a loss of $0.2 million during fiscal 2016, a gain of $0.2 million during fiscal 2015, and a loss of $0.1 million during fiscal 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.
355948_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Inventories: Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Our inventories include approximately $40.0 million of finished goods, $4.4 million of raw materials, and $1.0 million of work-in-progress as of May 28, 2016, as compared to approximately $33.7 million of finished goods, $3.2 million of raw materials, and $1.9 million of work-in-progress as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	The inventory reserve as of May 28, 2016, was $3.4 million compared to $3.0 million as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.7 million, $0.2 million, and $0.8 million during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which were included in cost of sales from continuing operations.
355948_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	The provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_16_ITEM8_P28_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Investments: As of May 28, 2016, we have invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit ( CD ) in the amount of $9.5 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Of this, $2.3 million mature in less than twelve months and $7.2 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	As of May 30, 2015, we had approximately $34.7 million invested in time deposits and CD s.
355948_16_ITEM8_P29_S3	Of this, $23.7 million mature in less than twelve months and $10.9 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_16_ITEM8_P29_S4	The fair value of these investments is the face value of each time deposit and CD.
355948_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	We also have investments in equity securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
355948_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	Our investments, which are included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.6 million at May 28, 2016, and $0.6 million at May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.3 million during fiscal 2016 and $0.2 million during fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	We reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
355948_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Gross realized gains and losses on those sales were less than $0.1 million during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Net unrealized holding losses during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, were less than $0.1 million and have been included in accumulated comprehensive income (loss) during its respective fiscal year.
355948_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Discontinued Operations: During fiscal year 2011, we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of, our RF, Wireless and Power Division ( RFPD ), as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets, to Arrow Electronics, Inc. ( Arrow ) in exchange for $238.8 million, ( the Transaction ).
355948_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations ( ASC 205-20 ), we reported the financial results of RFPD as a discontinued operation.
355948_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the third quarter as the measurement date.
355948_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in ASU 2011-08 we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
355948_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	We estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	For annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-08, Testing for Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU 2011-08 ) permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
355948_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
355948_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
355948_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
355948_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Provisions for depreciation are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
355948_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	Depreciation expense was approximately $2.0 million, $1.7 million, and $1.0 million during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	Property, plant and equipment consist of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Construction in progress includes $1.6 million related to our Healthcare growth initiatives, $0.9 million for our new IT system, and $0.2 million of other projects.
355948_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	All projects are expected to be completed before the end of fiscal 2017.
355948_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Supplemental disclosure information of the estimated useful life of the assets:
355948_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	We review all property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur which indicate a possible impairment may exist.
355948_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	We have concluded that our property, plant, and equipment as of May 28, 2016, were not impaired.
355948_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Accrued Liabilities: Accrued liabilities consist of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Warranties: We offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture.
355948_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty.
355948_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
355948_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale.
355948_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
355948_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
355948_16_ITEM8_P46_S3	With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period, and warranty experience.
355948_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
355948_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience, and other available evidence.
355948_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Changes in the warranty reserve during fiscal 2016 and 2015 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Other Non-Current Liabilities: Other non-current liabilities of $1.0 million at May 28, 2016, and $1.2 million at May 30, 2015, primarily represent employee-benefits obligations in various non-US locations.
355948_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We measure and recognize compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options.
355948_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends.
355948_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Compensation cost is recognized using a graded-vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period.
355948_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	Share-based compensation expense totaled approximately $0.5 million during fiscal 2016, $0.7 million during fiscal 2015, and $0.8 million during fiscal 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Stock options granted generally vest over a period of five years and have contractual terms to exercise of 10 years.
355948_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows ( in thousands, except option prices and years):
355948_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	There were 28,000 stock options exercised during fiscal 2016, with cash received of $0.1 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised totaled less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2016 and $0.2 million during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	The weighted average fair value of stock option grants was $1.21 during fiscal 2016, $3.71 during fiscal 2015, and $4.53 during fiscal 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P53_S3	As of May 28, 2016, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options was approximately $1.2 million which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of approximately three to four years.
355948_16_ITEM8_P53_S4	The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during fiscal 2016 was $0.6 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
355948_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience commensurate with the expected term.
355948_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).
355948_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	On December 21, 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 110 stating that they will continue to accept SAB No. 107, past the original expiration date of December 31, 2007.
355948_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	For stock options granted during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we believe that our historical stock option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
355948_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	We utilized the Safe Harbor option, or Simplified Method, to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with SAB No. 107 for options granted.
355948_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	We intend to continue to utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with SAB No. 110 until such time that we believe that our historical stock option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.
355948_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at May 28, 2016 ( in thousands, except option prices and years ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	As of May 28, 2016, we did not have any unvested restricted shares.
355948_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Compensation effects arising from issuing stock awards have been charged against income and recorded as additional paid-in-capital in the consolidated statements of stockholder s equity during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Employees 2011 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares as incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or stock awards.
355948_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	Under this plan, 950,000 shares are reserved for future issuance.
355948_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Plan authorizes the granting of stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant.
355948_16_ITEM8_P61_S3	Generally, these options become exercisable over five years and expire up to 10 years from the date of grant.
355948_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Earnings per Share: We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock, and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock.
355948_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time.
355948_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
355948_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.
355948_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method as prescribed in ASC 260.
355948_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The per share amounts presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) are based on the following ( amounts in thousands, except per share amounts ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Note: Common stock options that were anti-dilutive and not included in diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 were 890; 881; and 489 respectively.
355948_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
355948_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period; early adoption is not permitted.
355948_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
355948_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
355948_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
355948_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
355948_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
355948_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
355948_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
355948_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	ASU 2015-11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g., first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value.
355948_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
355948_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory.
355948_16_ITEM8_P73_S4	However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice.
355948_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 , Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , eliminating the current requirement for companies to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent.
355948_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	Instead, companies will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
355948_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	The adoption of this guidance will result in a balance sheet reclassification and require related disclosure revisions in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
355948_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	ASU 2016-09 introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.
355948_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	Specifically, the ASU requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
355948_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.
355948_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period.
355948_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	That is, off balance sheet accounting for net operating losses stemming from excess tax benefits would no longer be required and instead such net operating losses would be recognized when they arise.
355948_16_ITEM8_P77_S3	Existing net operating losses that are currently tracked off balance sheet would be recognized, net of a valuation allowance if required, through an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.
355948_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	Entities will no longer need to maintain and track an APIC pool.
355948_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.
355948_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	In addition, ASU 2016-09 elevates the statutory tax withholding threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction(s).
355948_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	The ASU also clarifies that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity.
355948_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	ASU 2016-09 provides an optional accounting policy election (with limited exceptions), to be applied on an entity-wide basis, to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (consistent with existing U.S. GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur.
355948_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	On June 15, 2015, Richardson Electronics, Ltd ( the Company ), acquired certain assets of International Medical Equipment and Services, Inc. ( IMES ), for a purchase price of $12.2 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	This includes the purchase of inventory, receivables, fixed assets, and certain other assets of the Company.
355948_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company did not acquire any liabilities of IMES.
355948_16_ITEM8_P81_S3	The total consideration paid excludes transaction costs.
355948_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	IMES, based in South Carolina, provides reliable, cost-saving solutions worldwide for major brands of CT and MRI equipment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	This acquisition positions Richardson Healthcare to provide cost effective diagnostic imaging replacement parts and training to hospitals, diagnostic imaging centers, medical institutions, and independent service organizations.
355948_16_ITEM8_P82_S2	IMES offers an extensive selection of replacement parts, as well as an interactive training center, on-site test bays and experienced technicians who provide 24/7 customer support.
355948_16_ITEM8_P82_S3	Replacement parts are readily available and triple tested to provide peace of mind when uptime is critical.
355948_16_ITEM8_P82_S4	IMES core operations will remain in South Carolina.
355948_16_ITEM8_P82_S5	Richardson Healthcare plans to expand IMES replacement parts and training offerings geographically to leverage the Company s global infrastructure.
355948_16_ITEM8_P82_S6	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, IMES opened up their first foreign location in Amsterdam.
355948_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	The consideration paid by the Company to IMES at closing was $12.2 million in cash.
355948_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired at the date of the closing of the acquisition (in thousands) :
355948_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	Intangible assets include trade names with an estimated life of 3 years for $0.6 million, customer relationships with an estimated life of 20 years for $2.5 million, non-compete agreements with an estimated life of 5 years for $0.2 million, and technology with an estimated life of 10 years for $0.2 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Goodwill recognized represents value the Company expects to be created by combining the operations of IMES with the Company s operations, including the expansion into markets within existing business segments and geographic regions, access to new customers and potential cost savings and synergies.
355948_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Goodwill related to the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
355948_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	In connection with the acquisition of IMES, the Company also entered into an Employment, Non-Disclosure, and Non-Compete Agreement ( Employment Agreement ) with Lee A. McIntyre III as the Company s Executive Vice President, IMES.
355948_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	During the term of his employment, Mr. McIntyre will earn an annual base salary of $300,000.
355948_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	In addition to his base salary, he will be entitled to an annual bonus equal to 20% of the EBITDA of IMES provided that the EBITDA of the business is at least $2.0 million inclusive of the bonus payment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P87_S3	The annual bonus payment will terminate after five years.

355948_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Changes in the carrying value of goodwill are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment, using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
355948_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	The goodwill balance in its entirety relates to our IMES reporting unit which is included in the Healthcare segment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present, we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.
355948_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	For annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-08, Testing for Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU 2011-08 ) permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
355948_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
355948_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	We had $6.3 million of goodwill on our balance sheet as of May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	In accordance with ASU 2011-08, the results of our goodwill impairment test as of February 28, 2016, indicated that the value of goodwill attributed to our IMES reporting unit, which is included in the Healthcare segment, was not impaired.
355948_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may, in testing for impairment, reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins.
355948_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and technology acquired in connection with our acquisitions.
355948_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	Intangible assets subject to amortization as well as amortization expense are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	We determined that intangible assets were not impaired as of May 28, 2016 on the basis that no adverse events or changes in circumstances were identified that could indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	The amortization expense associated with the intangible assets subject to amortization for the next five years is presented in the following table (in thousands) :
355948_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The amortization expense associated with the intangible assets totaled approximately $0.4 million during fiscal 2016 and $0.1 million during both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.
355948_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	The weighted average number of years of amortization expense remaining is 15.8 years.
355948_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	We lease certain warehouse and office facilities and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	Rent expense from continuing operations for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $2.0 million, $1.8 million, and $1.5 million, respectively.

355948_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	The differences between income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 34% and the reported income tax provision (benefit) for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 are summarized as follows:
355948_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
355948_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect continuing operations as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P116_S2	Significant components are as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	As of May 28, 2016, we had approximately $5.7 million of net deferred tax assets for federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards, compared to $3.0 million as of May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	Net deferred tax assets for domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $2.7 million, compared to $2.4 million during fiscal year 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.6 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_16_ITEM8_P117_S3	The amount of net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was the same as the fiscal year 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P117_S4	We also have a net deferred tax asset of $0.3 million related to foreign tax credit carryforwards as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	The changes in balances from prior year for the federal NOL carryforwards is driven by current year forecast taxable losses.
355948_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $6.7 million and $4.8 million as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015, respectively, on foreign earnings of $48.7 million and $38.2 million, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The increase year over year relates to the change in management s assertion for RELL China.
355948_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	As of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we changed our assertion to no longer be permanently reinvested in China.
355948_16_ITEM8_P120_S2	In addition, as of May 28, 2016, $5.7 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_16_ITEM8_P120_S3	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended May 28, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM8_P121_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_16_ITEM8_P121_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_16_ITEM8_P121_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	As of May 28, 2016, a valuation allowance of $5.9 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	There has been an increase in the valuation allowance from May 30, 2015 in the amount of $0.7 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions relates to jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings, and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.7 million, $0.5 million, and $2.1 million, during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2006 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	We are under examination in the state of Illinois for fiscal years 2012 and 2013.
355948_16_ITEM8_P125_S3	We are currently under examination in Thailand for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 and France for fiscal years 2013 and 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P125_S4	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_16_ITEM8_P125_S5	After the closure of the Germany tax audit for fiscal years 2009 through 2011, we have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2012 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2010.
355948_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	The uncertain tax positions from continuing operations as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015, totaled $0.1 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the unaudited consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
355948_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
355948_16_ITEM8_P127_S2	The following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits for continuing and discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):
355948_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
355948_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P129_S2	We have not recorded a liability for interest and penalties as of May 28, 2016, and none were recorded during May 30, 2015.
355948_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next 12 months.
355948_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	Employee Profit Sharing Plan: The employee profit sharing plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan for employees.
355948_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	The profit sharing plan has a 401(k) provision whereby we match 50% of employee contributions up to 4.0% of pay.
355948_16_ITEM8_P131_S2	Charges to expense for matching contributions to this plan were $0.4 million, $0.3 million, and $0.3 million, during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
355948_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Healthcare.
355948_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with OEM and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_16_ITEM8_P133_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_16_ITEM8_P133_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile Healthcare industry.
355948_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	In accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , we have identified three reportable segments: PMT and Canvys, and Healthcare.
355948_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	Electron Device Group ( EDG ), renamed Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ) in July 2015, provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_16_ITEM8_P135_S2	PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, industrial, and OEM markets.

355948_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	The CEO evaluates performance and allocates resources primarily based on the gross profit of each segment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	Operating results by segment are summarized in the following table ( in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	A reconciliation of assets to the relevant consolidated amount is as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	(1) Other current assets include miscellaneous receivables, prepaid expenses, and current deferred income taxes.
355948_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	Assets are not disclosed by reportable segment as the Company does not track assets by reportable segment and certain assets are not specific to any reportable segment.
355948_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	Capital expenditures for our Healthcare segment during fiscal 2016 were approximately $2.9 million.
355948_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	In addition, we also had capital expenditures during fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015 related to the Company s new ERP system that are not specific to any particular reportable segment.

355948_16_ITEM8_P150_S2	There are approximately $1.3 million of long-lived assets that belong to our foreign affiliates.
355948_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	The Company had depreciation and amortization expense of $2.4 million as of May 28, 2016.

355948_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	We are involved in several pending judicial proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
355948_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	While the outcome of litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on information available at the time the financial statements were issued, we determined disclosure of contingencies relating to any of our pending judicial proceedings was not necessary because there was less than a reasonable possibility that a material loss had been incurred.
355948_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	During fiscal 2014, we received settlements in the amount of $2.5 million related to an antitrust class action lawsuit settlement.
355948_16_ITEM8_P153_S1	The settlement was recorded as proceeds from legal settlement within the Other Income section of our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
355948_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
355948_16_ITEM8_P155_S1	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
355948_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	As of May 28, 2016, we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
355948_16_ITEM8_P156_S1	Our investments consist of time deposits and CDs, where face value is equal to fair value, and equity securities of publicly traded companies for which market prices are readily available.
355948_16_ITEM8_P157_S0	Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015, were as follows ( in thousands ):

355948_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_16_ITEM8_P173_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_16_ITEM8_P174_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

355948_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

355948_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

355948_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	Sales increased $3.9 million for PMT and $1.6 million for Healthcare, which includes net sales for International Medical Equipment Systems ( IMES ), acquired early this fiscal year.
355948_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	The increase was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in Canvys.
355948_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	Gross margin increased to $13.4 million, or 33.8% of net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $10.2 million, or 29.2% of net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	Margin improved as a percent of net sales primarily due to sales of diagnostic imaging replacement parts in the Healthcare business.
355948_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Operating expenses increased to $13.7 million for fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $12.9 million for fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	However, operating expenses as a percent of net sales improved to 34.6% versus 36.8% in the same period last year.
355948_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	The increase in SG A was due to $1.1 million related to IMES and additional investments in our Richardson Healthcare business and $0.8 million in PMT, partially offset by decreases of $0.3 million in IT services, $0.6 million in our other support functions, and $0.2 million in Canvys.
355948_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	As a result, operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $0.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million in the prior year s fourth quarter.
355948_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Other expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, including foreign exchange, was less than $0.1 million, compared to less than $0.1 million in other income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The income tax benefit of $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects an adjusted lower provision for foreign taxes as well as the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss in the U.S.
355948_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $0.2 million, compared to net loss of $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of last year.
355948_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 were $142.0 million, a 3.7% increase, compared to net sales of $137.0 million in the prior year.
355948_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	Sales for the Company s Healthcare business increased $6.4 million, which includes net sales for IMES, acquired early this fiscal year.
355948_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	The increase was partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in Canvys and $0.2 million decrease in PMT.
355948_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Gross margin increased to $44.8 million, or 31.6% of net sales during fiscal 2016, compared to $41.1 million, or 30.0% of net sales during fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	Margin improved as a percent of sales primarily due to higher margins associated with the sale of diagnostic imaging replacement parts in the Healthcare business.
355948_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	Operating expenses increased to $51.6 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $49.2 million for the fiscal 2015 and as a percentage of sales increased from 35.9% to 36.4%.
355948_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	The increase in SG A reflected $5.0 million for IMES and additional investments in our Richardson Healthcare business and $0.7 million in PMT, partially offset by decreases of $1.9 million in IT services, $0.9 million in our other support functions, and $0.5 million in Canvys.
355948_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	As a result, operating loss for fiscal 2016 was $6.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $8.1 million in fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Other income for fiscal 2016, including foreign exchange, was $0.3 million, compared to $1.1 million in other income for fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The income tax provision of $0.5 million during fiscal 2016 was due to foreign income tax expense and additional tax due in Germany that resulted from an audit.
355948_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Net loss for fiscal 2016 was $6.8 million, compared to net loss of $5.6 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a $0.06 quarterly dividend per share to holders of common stock and a $0.054 cash dividend per share to holders of Class B common stock.
355948_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	The dividend will be payable on August 24, 2016, to common stockholders of record on August 8, 2016.
355948_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	Cash and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 were $70.5 million.
355948_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under the existing share repurchase authorization.
355948_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	Since the sale of RFPD, the Company has spent $65.6 million on share repurchases and currently has 10.7 million outstanding shares of common stock and 2.1 million outstanding shares of Class B common stock.
355948_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Since the sale of RFPD in 2011, we have spent more than $17 million on dividends, said Edward J. Richardson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.
355948_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	Including share repurchases, we have returned more than $82 million to our shareholders.
355948_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	Our intent now is to further improve shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives.
355948_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	We are pleased with the significant improvement in our financial performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
355948_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	In addition to a large U.S. government sale, there were other areas of improvement, including strong IMES sales and gross margin and lower S, G A expenses as a percent of net sales, said Mr. Richardson.
355948_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	We are highly focused on revenue growth in fiscal 2017, while carefully managing our cash flow.
355948_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	We have implemented programs to reduce our run rate expenses for fiscal year 2017, and are working on more operational improvement initiatives so we may continue to invest in our growth strategy, Mr. Richardson concluded.

355948_16_ITEM15_P73_S4	More information is available at www.rell.com.
355948_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Richardson Electronics common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol RELL.
355948_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high value flat panel detector solutions, replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions.
355948_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets.
355948_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	The Company s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_17_ITEM1_P0_S3	The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
355948_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions.
355948_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
355948_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare ( Healthcare ).
355948_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEM ) and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_17_ITEM1_P3_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile healthcare industry.
355948_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our fiscal year 2017 began on May 29, 2016, and ended on May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
355948_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 is set forth in Note 11 Segment and Geographic Information of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
355948_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ), launched in July 2015, combines Electron Device Group s ( EDG ) core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies.
355948_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	As a manufacturer and authorized distributor, PMT s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair all through our existing global infrastructure.
355948_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	PMT s focus is on products for power, RF and microwave applications for customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	PMT represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and industrial power applications.
355948_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Among the suppliers they support are Amperex, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, MaCom, National, NJRC, Thales, Toshiba, and Vishay.
355948_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	PMT s inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment.
355948_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	PMT also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology.
355948_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, PMT is increasing its market share.
355948_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	PMT often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases.
355948_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	As manufacturers for these products exit the business, PMT has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
355948_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	PMT has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights which often include global coverage.
355948_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches which are not cured within a reasonable period of time.
355948_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Although some of these agreements allow PMT to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case PMT may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
355948_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	PMT s suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to PMT by its customers.
355948_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including: Amperex , Cetron , and National .
355948_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators, and liquid crystal display monitors.
355948_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics, and a wide variety of fabricated metal components.
355948_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.
355948_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and medical original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) markets.
355948_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our engineers design, manufacture, source, and support a full spectrum of solutions to match the needs of our customers.
355948_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	We offer custom display solutions that include touch screens, protective panels, custom enclosures, specialized cabinet finishes, and application specific software packages.
355948_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our volume commitments are much lower than those of the large display manufacturers, making us the ideal choice for companies with very specific design requirements.
355948_17_ITEM1_P16_S4	We partner with both private label manufacturing companies and leading branded hardware vendors to offer the high quality liquid crystal displays, mounting devices, and customized computing platforms.
355948_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	We have long-standing relationships with key component and finished goods manufacturers including 3M, LG, NEC Displays, and several key Asian display manufacturers that manufacture products to our specifications.
355948_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe supplier relationships, combined with our engineering design and manufacturing capabilities and private label partnerships, allow us to maintain a well-balanced and technologically advanced offering of customer specific display solutions.
355948_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Healthcare manufactures, refurbishes and distributes high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, asset management companies, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers.
355948_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Products include Diagnostic Imaging replacement parts including CT and MRI tubes, hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; replacement flat panel detectors and upgrades; and additional replacement components currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.
355948_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have employees, as well as authorized representatives, who are not our employees, selling our products primarily in regions where we do not have a direct sales presence.
355948_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	We offer various credit terms to qualifying customers as well as cash in advance and credit card terms.
355948_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	We establish credit limits for each customer and routinely review delinquent and aging accounts.
355948_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	We maintain approximately 110,700 part numbers in our product inventory database and we estimate that more than 90% of orders received by 6:00 p.m. local time are shipped complete the same day if product is in stock.

355948_17_ITEM1_P26_S4	The foregoing information regarding our website is provided for convenience and the content of our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should consider carefully the following risk factors in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we believe are applicable to our businesses and the industries in which we operate.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our businesses, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	A significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held by our foreign subsidiaries and could affect future liquidity needs.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We hold a significant amount of cash and investment securities at our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Liquidity requirements could necessitate transfers of existing cash balances between our subsidiaries or to the United States that may be subject to restrictions or result in unfavorable tax or earnings consequences for those amounts that are not considered reinvested indefinitely.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Approximately 76% of our cash and investment securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	While we intend to use some of the cash held outside the United States to fund our international operations and growth, when we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that we cannot fulfill through other internal or external sources, we may experience unfavorable tax, earnings and liquidity consequences due to cash transfers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P0_S7	These adverse consequences would occur, for example, if the transfer of cash into the United Sates is taxed and no offsetting foreign tax credit or net operating loss carryforward is available to offset the U.S. tax liability, resulting in lower earnings and liquidity.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We do not provide for U.S. taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We may not achieve our plan for sales growth and margin targets.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have established both margin and expense targets to grow our sales with new and existing customers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to leverage our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:
355948_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our growth objectives.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our products generally support industrial machinery that is powered by tube technology.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As technology evolves and this capital equipment is replaced, the market for our products potentially declines.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, the market for many of our other products is characterized by rapid change resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products which we may be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	This may result in a decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We face competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	There are very few vacuum tube competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	There are also a limited number of Chinese manufacturers whose ability to produce vacuum tubes has progressed over the past several years.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The most significant competitive risk comes from technical obsolescence.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Canvys faces many competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As we expand our business and pursue our growth initiatives, we may encounter increased competition from current and/or new competitors.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	As of July 24, 2017, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 66% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We are dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply us with essential products.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our principal products are capacitors, vacuum tubes and related products, microwave generators, and high voltage power supplies.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The products we supply are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	One of our suppliers represented more than 10% of our total cost of sales.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	To the extent that our significant suppliers are unwilling or unable to continue to do business with us, or extend lead times, or limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of risks which could impact our results.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, and changes in tax laws.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the United States.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the base currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income will decrease.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund U.S. operations or strategic opportunities may be restricted or may subject us to a significant tax liability.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As of May 27, 2017, $48.6 million of cash, cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Some of these subsidiaries are located in jurisdictions which require foreign government approval before a cash repatriation can occur.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, under current tax law, repatriation of this cash may trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the U.S.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives, such as stock repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and other strategic opportunities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we are unable to, or choose not to, repatriate our overseas cash.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders ownership interests in us.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Furthermore, lenders may not agree to extend us new, additional or continuing credit.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In a non-binding referendum on the United Kingdom s membership in the European Union in June 2016, a majority of those who voted approved the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Any withdrawal by the United Kingdom from the European Union ( Brexit ) would occur after, or possible concurrently with, a process of negotiation regarding the future terms of the United Kingdom s relationship with the European Union, which could result in the United Kingdom losing access to certain aspects of the single EU market and the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The Brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the European Union, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, political systems or financial institutions and the financial and monetary system.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Given that we conduct a substantial portion of our business in the European Union, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	The uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit could also have a negative impact on the growth of the European economy and cause greater volatility in all of the global currencies that we currently use to transact business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely heavily on information technology systems which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We rely on our information technology systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase, manufacture, and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	A significant disruption or failure in the design, operation, security or support of our information technology systems could significantly disrupt our business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our information technology systems may be subject to cyber attacks, security breaches or computer hacking.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and its data, as well as the data of our business partners.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The costs to mitigate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about us, our business partners or other third parties could expose us to significant potential liability and reputational harm.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	As threats related to cyber attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our profitability.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	As a global enterprise, we could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Many of our components are sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Since a defect or failure in a product could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We extend credit to our customers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management s evaluation of factors which include such things as a customer s financial condition, payment history, and the availability of collateral to secure customers receivables.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Failure to successfully implement our growth initiatives, or failure to realize the benefits expected from these initiatives if implemented, may create ongoing operating losses or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our growth strategy focuses on expanding our healthcare and our power conversion businesses.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	On June 15, 2015, we acquired certain assets, including inventory, receivables, fixed assets, and certain other assets, of International Medical Equipment and Services, Inc. ( IMES ), for a purchase price of $12.2 million.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In July 2015, we launched Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ), which combines our core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may be unable to implement our growth initiatives or reach profitability in the near future or at all, due to many factors, including factors outside of our control.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If our investments in these growth initiatives do not yield anticipated returns for any reason, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As part of our growth strategy, our intent is to acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition, and integrating the operations, personnel and systems of the acquired businesses.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Economic uncertainty also makes it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our operating results during fiscal 2017 reflect a net loss.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	There can be no assurance that we will experience a recovery in the near future; nor is there any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	From time to time, third parties, including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers, may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our management s attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We may have to stop selling certain products or certain technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We currently have significant cash and investments.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The company s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We ascribe value to certain intangible assets, which consist of customer lists and trade names resulting from acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We may incur an impairment charge on goodwill or on intangible assets if we determine that the fair value of the intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	We evaluate whether events have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may no longer be recoverable.
355948_17_ITEM1A_P60_S3	If this is the case, an impairment charge to earnings would be necessary.
355948_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns one facility and leases 26 facilities.
355948_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own our corporate facility and largest distribution center, which is located on approximately 100 acres in LaFox, Illinois and consists of approximately 242,000 square feet of manufacturing, warehouse, and office space.
355948_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	We maintain geographically diverse facilities because we believe this provides value to our customers and suppliers, and limits market risk and exchange rate exposure.
355948_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	We consider our properties to be well maintained, in sound condition, and adequate for our present needs.
355948_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	The extent of utilization varies from property to property and from time to time during the year.
355948_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our facility locations, their primary use, and segments served are as follows:
355948_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	LaFox, Illinois is also the location of our corporate headquarters.
355948_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	Sold building June 12, 2017, currently lease separate facility.
355948_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we or our subsidiaries are involved in pending judicial proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business.
355948_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	While the outcome of litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on information at the time the financial statements were issued, we do not believe that the outcome of any current claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	There were no share repurchases in fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our quarterly dividend was $0.06 per common share and $0.054 per Class B common share.
355948_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	Annual dividend payments for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016 were approximately $3.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_17_ITEM5_P1_S3	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ) under the trading symbol ( RELL ).
355948_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.
355948_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	As of July 24, 2017, there were approximately 558 stockholders of record for the common stock and approximately 15 stockholders of record for the Class B common stock.
355948_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low closing sales price per share of RELL common stock as reported on the NASDAQ for the periods indicated.
355948_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph compares the performance of our common stock for the periods indicated with the performance of the NASDAQ Composite Index and NASDAQ Electronic Components Index.
355948_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	The graph assumes $100 invested on the last day of our fiscal year 2012, in our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index, and NASDAQ Electronic Components Index.
355948_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	Total return indices reflect reinvestment of dividends at the closing stock prices at the date of the dividend declaration.
355948_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	*$100 invested on 6/2/12 in stock or 5/31/12 in index, including reinvestment of dividends.

355948_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Gross profit reflects the distribution and manufacturing product margin less manufacturing variances, inventory obsolescence charges, customer returns, scrap and cycle count adjustments, engineering costs, unabsorbed manufacturing labor and overhead, and other provisions.
355948_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Consolidated gross profit was $43.9 million during fiscal 2017, compared to $44.8 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.1% during fiscal 2017, from 31.6% during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Gross margin during fiscal 2017 included expense related to inventory provisions for PMT of $0.4 million, $0.1 million for Canvys, and less than $0.1 million for Healthcare.

355948_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net sales for PMT decreased 1.3% to $104.2 million during fiscal 2017, from $105.6 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	Last year, we recognized a large tube order for a military application which was mostly offset in fiscal 2017 by new technology suppliers in the RF, microwave and power market as well as increases in manufactured products associated with growth in the semiconductor wafer fab market.
355948_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.0% during fiscal 2017 as compared to 31.3% during fiscal 2016, primarily due to product mix and improved manufacturing absorption.
355948_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net sales for PMT decreased 0.2% to $105.6 million during fiscal 2016, from $105.7 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	We recognized a large tube order for a military application and sales of power conversion and RF and microwave components increased.
355948_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	This was offset by a decline in the broadcast market along with specialty products manufactured in LaFox and sold primarily into the semiconductor capital equipment market.
355948_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained flat at 31.3% during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net sales for Canvys decreased 12.4% to $20.5 million during fiscal 2017, from $23.5 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Sales in North America were down due to customer delays in new program rollouts.
355948_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 28.0% during fiscal 2017 as compared to 25.7% during fiscal 2016, primarily due to product mix and lower inventory reserves.
355948_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Net sales for Canvys decreased 4.8% to $23.5 million during fiscal 2016, from $24.6 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Sales in the North America OEM markets were down due to specific customers going through acquisitions within our customer base that disrupted the day to day business and delays in new programs.
355948_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales declined to 25.7% during fiscal 2016 as compared to 26.2% during fiscal 2015, primarily due to the devaluation of the Euro.
355948_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net sales for Healthcare decreased 6.9% to $12.1 million during fiscal 2017, from $13.0 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The reduction in sales was due to a decline in the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) display business, which we divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	This decline was slightly offset by an increase in sales in our core Healthcare business including diagnostic imaging replacement parts and CT tubes.
355948_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39.2% during fiscal 2017, compared to 44.0% during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	This decrease was primarily due to change in product mix that included a significant increase year over year in IMES equipment sales, which yield lower margins than replacement parts and CT tubes, in addition to continued pricing pressure on replacement parts resulting in lower margins.
355948_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net sales for Healthcare increased 98.2% to $13.0 million during fiscal 2016, from $6.6 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The acquisition of IMES during fiscal 2016 resulted in $7.6 million in sales, however sales in the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) display market were down $1.2 million driven by budget concerns and a difficult capital market for hospitals.
355948_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 44.0% during fiscal 2016, compared to 24.1% during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	This increase was primarily due to the significantly higher gross margins of the IMES business acquired during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	On a geographic basis, our sales are categorized by destination: North America; Europe; Asia/Pacific; Latin America; and Other.
355948_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net sales by geographic area and percent change for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Gross profit by geographic area and percent of geographic net sales for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	(1) Other primarily includes net sales not allocated to a specific geographical region, unabsorbed value-add costs, and unallocated freight expenses.
355948_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	We sell our products to customers in diversified industries and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition.
355948_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
355948_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Estimates of credit losses are recorded in the financial statements based on monthly reviews of outstanding accounts.
355948_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Selling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) decreased during fiscal 2017 to $49.9 million from $51.6 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	SG&A as a percentage of sales, remained flat at 36.4% during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The decrease was due to lower salaries and incentive compensation expenses from workforce reductions, and a reduction of IT expenses compared to fiscal 2016, mostly offset by $1.3 million of severance expense related to a reduction in workforce during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	In addition, research and development expenses for Richardson Healthcare increased by $0.5 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Selling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) increased during fiscal 2016 to $51.6 million from $49.2 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	SG&A as a percentage of sales, increased to 36.4% during fiscal 2016 from 35.9% during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	The increase in SG&A was due to $5.0 million related to IMES and additional investments in our Richardson Healthcare business to support its growth and $0.7 million in PMT to support the power conversion growth initiatives, partially offset by decreases of $1.9 million in IT services, $0.9 million in our other support functions, and $0.5 million in Canvys.
355948_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Other income/expense was expense of $0.4 million during fiscal 2017, compared to income of $0.3 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Fiscal 2017 included $0.2 million of investment income, offset by $0.6 million of foreign exchange losses.
355948_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	Fiscal 2016 included $0.6 million of investment income, partially offset by $0.2 million of foreign exchange losses.
355948_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities.
355948_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.
355948_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our income tax provision from continuing operations during fiscal year 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our income tax benefit for fiscal 2015 was $1.5 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	The effective income tax rates for continuing operations during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, were 13.3%, 8.8%, and (20.9)%, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	The difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% during 2017, 2016, and 2015 is primarily driven by the impact of recording a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets, repatriation of foreign earnings, changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss), and our recording of uncertain tax positions with respect to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	As of May 27, 2017, we had approximately $4.2 million of net deferred tax assets related to federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards, compared to $5.7 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	Net deferred tax assets related to domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $3.0 million, compared to $2.7 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.7 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	The amount of net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was $0.6 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	We also have a domestic net deferred tax asset of $3.8 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of May 27, 2017, compared to $0.3 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S5	The changes in balances from prior year for the federal NOL carryforwards was driven by current year taxable losses which was offset by income that was generated from a dividend from Richardson Electronics China during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S6	The dividend also drove the increase in the foreign tax credit carryforward.
355948_17_ITEM7_P38_S7	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $5.7 million and $6.7 million as of May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016, respectively, on foreign earnings of $39.5 million and $48.7 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decrease year over year primarily relates to the realization of the income from the Richardson Electronics China dividend which was previously accounted for at May 28, 2016 as part of our undistributed earnings liability for foreign subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	In addition, as of May 27, 2017, $6.4 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	As of May 27, 2017, a valuation allowance of $8.5 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	There has been an increase in the valuation allowance from May 28, 2016 in the amount of $2.6 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings, and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.4 million, $0.7 million, and $0.5 million, during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2007 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	We are under examination in the state of Illinois for fiscal years 2011 through 2013.
355948_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	We are currently under examination in Germany (fiscal 2011 through 2014) and Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011).
355948_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_17_ITEM7_P44_S5	We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2011 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2011.
355948_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The uncertain tax positions from continuing operations as of May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016, totaled $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
355948_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months for which an amount can be determined.
355948_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	During fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of our RF, Wireless, and Power Division ( RFPD ), as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets, to Arrow Electronics, Inc. ( Arrow ) in exchange for $238.8 million ( the Transaction ).
355948_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations ( ASC 205-20 ), we reported the financial results of RFPD as a discontinued operation.
355948_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Refer to Note 5 Discontinued Operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	There were no discontinued operations in either fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	In fiscal 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of less than $0.1 million due to an income tax audit as a result of the Transaction.
355948_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	The Company has an unrecognized tax benefit for discontinued operations relating to an amended Illinois state income tax return related to the Transaction.
355948_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our growth and cash needs have been primarily financed through income from operations and cash on hand.
355948_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Cash and cash equivalents were $55.4 million at May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Investments including CD s and time deposits, classified as short-term investments were $6.4 million and long-term investments were $2.4 million including equity securities of $0.6 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	Cash and investments at May 27, 2017, consisted of $16.3 million in North America, $15.5 million in Europe, $1.5 million in Latin America, and $30.9 million in Asia/Pacific.
355948_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	We repatriated $11.3 million to the U.S. from China during our first quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Cash and cash equivalents were $60.4 million at May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Investments including CD s and time deposits, classified as short-term investments were $2.3 million and long-term investments were $7.8 million including equity securities of $0.6 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	Cash and investments at May 28, 2016, consisted of $18.1 million in North America, $12.6 million in Europe, $0.7 million in Latin America, and $39.1 million in Asia/Pacific.
355948_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	We believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future growth strategies for our business in the foreseeable future.
355948_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Positive cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Operating activities provided $1.8 million of cash during fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	We had net loss of $6.9 million during fiscal 2017, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards, $0.5 million of inventory provisions, and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities was $5.4 million during fiscal 2017, due primarily to the decrease in accounts receivable of $4.2 million, the decrease in inventories of $2.4 million, the increase in our accounts payable of $1.0 million, partially offset by the decrease in accrued liabilities of $0.7 million and the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.3 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	The decrease in, or cash provided by, our inventory was primarily due to key supply chain efforts to reduce and manage inventory levels.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S4	The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the collection of a large receivable during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that was invoiced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S5	The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in our accrual for inventory in transit from vendors.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S6	The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to a reductions in incentive accruals and an asset retirement obligation in France.
355948_17_ITEM7_P54_S7	The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was due to investments in our Healthcare segment and other receivables with a supplier and for the sale of assets.
355948_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Operating activities used $13.6 million of cash during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	We had net loss of $6.8 million during fiscal 2016, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.4 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets.
355948_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquired business, was a use of cash of $9.7 million during fiscal 2016, due primarily to the increase in inventories of $5.2 million, the increase in accounts receivable of $3.5 million, the decrease in our accounts payable of $0.9 million, the decrease in accrued liabilities of $1.0 million, and the decrease in income tax receivable of $0.9 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	The increase, or use of cash, for our inventory was primarily due to purchases related to our power conversion and Healthcare growth initiatives.
355948_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	The decrease in accounts payable is due to larger purchases of fixed assets and inventory primarily related to our Healthcare initiative where shorter payment terms are required.
355948_17_ITEM7_P55_S5	The decrease in accrual liabilities is due primarily to a $0.7 million decrease in our severance accrual.
355948_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The cash flow from investing activities has consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments and capital expenditures.
355948_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Cash used in investing activities of $3.8 million during fiscal 2017, which included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $3.6 million, offset by the purchases of investments of $2.2 million, and $5.2 million in capital expenditures.
355948_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Capital expenditures relates primarily to our Healthcare growth initiatives and capital equipment and software for our new IT system.
355948_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cash provided by investing activities of $8.2 million during fiscal 2016, included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $27.0 million and proceeds from the sale of our building in Spain of $0.4 million, offset by the acquisition of IMES of $12.2 million, purchases of investments of $2.2 million, and $4.8 million in capital expenditures.
355948_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	Capital expenditures relate primarily to our Healthcare growth initiatives and capital for our new IT system.
355948_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our purchases and proceeds from investments consist of time deposits and CDs.
355948_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
355948_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The cash flow from financing activities primarily consists of repurchases of common stock and cash dividends paid.
355948_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $3.0 million for dividends paid, which were approved by the Board of Directors.
355948_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $8.0 million.
355948_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	This included $5.0 million of cash used to repurchase common stock and $3.1 million in dividends paid, offset by $0.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises.
355948_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	The repurchase of common stock relates to our share repurchase authorizations.
355948_17_ITEM7_P62_S3	Cash dividends paid of $3.1 million were approved by the Board of Directors.
355948_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Contractual obligations by expiration period are presented in the table below as of May 27, 2017 ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	We believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending June 2, 2018.
355948_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and the results of operations.
355948_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
355948_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.4 million as of May 27, 2017, and $0.4 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_17_ITEM7_P71_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Our net inventories included approximately $36.0 million of finished goods, $5.3 million of raw materials, and $1.4 million of work-in-progress as of May 27, 2017, as compared to approximately $40.0 million of finished goods, $4.4 million of raw materials, and $1.0 million of work-in-progress as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain market segments, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.5 million, $0.7 million, and $0.2 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	The provisions were primarily for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	There was $6.3 million of goodwill reported on our balance sheet at both May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The goodwill balance in its entirety relates to our IMES reporting unit which is included in the Healthcare segment.
355948_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
355948_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in ASU 2011-08 we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
355948_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	We estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our goodwill impairment testing follows the two-step process as defined in ASC 350.
355948_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	The first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
355948_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized.
355948_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from the first step of the evaluation is allocated to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in order to determine an implied goodwill value.
355948_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	This allocation is similar to the purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting.
355948_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	If the carrying amount of the goodwill reported exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
355948_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	After reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in ASU 2011-08, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value for the IMES reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
355948_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Accordingly, the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test as described in FASB ASC 350-20-35 was performed.
355948_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	We performed the first step of the two step impairment test using the income method, which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital.
355948_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The results of our goodwill impairment test as of February 26, 2017 indicated that the value of goodwill attributed to our IMES reporting unit was not impaired.
355948_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Since the acquisition of IMES in June 2015, there have been no fundamental changes in the business or market that would indicate a significant decline in the fair value since the acquisition date.
355948_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	In the two years since acquisition, the Company has made significant investments in the IMES business, including $6 million in capital expenditures that are expected to increase IMES product offerings and result in increased future sales, operating profit and cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Management s projections used to estimate the undiscounted cash flows included increasing sales volumes from new product offerings being developed and expanded sales into new geographies and operational improvements designed to reduce costs.
355948_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Changes in any of the significant assumptions used, including if the Company does not successfully achieve its operating plan, which is dependent on the creation of new product offerings, can materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could result in a material non-cash impairment charge of goodwill and other long lived assets.
355948_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and technology acquired in connection with the acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	We review property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	If adverse events do occur, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities.
355948_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates.
355948_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and review business plans for possible impairment.
355948_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group.
355948_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value.
355948_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Additionally, we also evaluate the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization.
355948_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	If the estimate of a long lived asset s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.
355948_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	When only a range of possible losses can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_17_ITEM7_P95_S4	See Note 9 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
355948_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_17_ITEM7_P97_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
355948_17_ITEM7_P97_S3	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
355948_17_ITEM7_P97_S4	Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7_P97_S5	Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
355948_17_ITEM7_P97_S6	During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
355948_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements using a three-phase approach (assessment, conversion and implementation).
355948_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	We are in our primary assessment stage, which included identifying revenue streams, contracts and responsible parties who create and manage those accounts, quantifying the impact of identified contracts on the financial statements and identifying internal control changes.
355948_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	We are in the initial stage of our assessment phase and therefore further evaluation is needed to determine the impact on our financial statements, related disclosures and controls upon adoption.
355948_17_ITEM7_P98_S3	We expect to finalize the primary assessment phase in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
355948_17_ITEM7_P98_S4	We will complete the conversion and implementation phases during fiscal 2018 in conjunction with future interpretative guidance.
355948_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 ( ASU 2015-11 ), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
355948_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	ASU 2015-11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g., first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value.
355948_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
355948_17_ITEM7_P99_S3	The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory.
355948_17_ITEM7_P99_S4	However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice.
355948_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
355948_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	ASU 2015-17 eliminates the prior US GAAP guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes, that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet.
355948_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	The amendments in ASU 2015-17 require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet.
355948_17_ITEM7_P101_S3	ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_17_ITEM7_P101_S4	In order to simplify presentation of deferred tax balances, the Company adopted this standard prospectively in the quarter ended August 27, 2016, which did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or stockholders equity.
355948_17_ITEM7_P101_S5	Periods prior to August 27, 2016 were not retrospectively adjusted.
355948_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases.
355948_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
355948_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
355948_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
355948_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
355948_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Upon adoption, the Company expects that the amounts recognized for the ROU asset and lease liability in the balance sheets may be material.
355948_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ), Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
355948_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	ASU 2016-09 introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.
355948_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	ASU 2016-09 will directly impact the tax administration of equity plans.
355948_17_ITEM7_P105_S3	ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_17_ITEM7_P105_S4	Early adoption is permitted and any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
355948_17_ITEM7_P105_S5	The Company expects to adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, at which time we will evaluate the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ), Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
355948_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM7_P106_S2	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P106_S3	The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.
355948_17_ITEM7_P106_S4	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
355948_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
355948_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	As amended, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
355948_17_ITEM7_P107_S3	An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
355948_17_ITEM7_P107_S4	An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
355948_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	ASU 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
355948_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets, and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements, denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency, are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in certain sales contracts and we also have local debt to offset asset exposures.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We have not used any derivative instruments nor entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, or fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $9.1 million during fiscal 2017, an estimated $9.9 million during fiscal 2016, and an estimated $9.6 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $5.2 million as of the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, and an estimated $6.5 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2016, while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, and an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high value flat panel detector solutions, replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	The Company s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_17_ITEM8_P0_S3	The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
355948_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
355948_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare ( Healthcare ).
355948_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEM ) and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_17_ITEM8_P3_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile healthcare industry.
355948_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
355948_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	The Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ), formerly called the Electron Device Group ( EDG ) prior to July 2015, provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and medical OEM markets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	Healthcare manufactures, refurbishes and distributes high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, asset management companies, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers.
355948_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	Products include Diagnostic Imaging replacement parts including CT and MRI tubes, hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; replacement flat panel detectors and upgrades; and additional replacement components currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.
355948_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
355948_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Customer Concentration: No one customer represented more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance as of May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	One customer represented $3.8 million, or 15%, of our total accounts receivable balance, as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	This receivable was collected in the first month of our fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P10_S3	No one customer represented more than 10% of net sales for either fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	Supplier Concentration: One of our suppliers represented 14% of our total cost of sales as of May 27, 2017, and 15% as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount owed to this supplier was approximately $2.3 million as of May 27, 2017, and $2.2 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for all fiscal years presented.
355948_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Our fiscal year 2017 began on May 29, 2016, and ended on May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies, and income taxes.
355948_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Our financial instruments include investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.
355948_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	The fair values of these financial instruments approximate carrying values at May 27, 2017, and May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; collectability and delinquency history by geographic area; and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.
355948_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.4 million as of both May 27, 2017, and as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_17_ITEM8_P22_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The functional currency is the local currency at all foreign locations, with the exception of Hong Kong, which the functional currency is the US dollar.
355948_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheet are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period spot rates.
355948_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of stockholders equity.
355948_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the current rate on the date of the transaction.
355948_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.
355948_17_ITEM8_P24_S4	Foreign currency translation reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss was a loss of $0.6 million during fiscal 2017, a loss of $0.2 million during fiscal 2016, and a gain of $0.2 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.
355948_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Inventories, net: Our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	Our net inventories include approximately $36.0 million of finished goods, $5.3 million of raw materials, and $1.4 million of work-in-progress as of May 27, 2017, as compared to approximately $40.0 million of finished goods, $4.4 million of raw materials, and $1.0 million of work-in-progress as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	The inventory reserve as of May 27, 2017, was $3.5 million compared to $3.4 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	If future demand, changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.5 million, $0.7 million, and $0.2 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	The provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Investments: As of May 27, 2017, we have invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit ( CD ) in the amount of $8.2 million.
355948_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Of this, $6.4 million mature in less than twelve months and $1.8 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	As of May 28, 2016, we had approximately $9.5 million invested in time deposits and CD s.
355948_17_ITEM8_P30_S3	Of this, $2.3 million mature in less than twelve months and $7.2 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_17_ITEM8_P30_S4	The fair value of these investments is the face value of each time deposit and CD.
355948_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	We also have investments in equity securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
355948_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Our investments, which are included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.6 million at May 27, 2017 and at May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.3 million during fiscal 2017, $0.3 million during fiscal 2016 and $0.2 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	We reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
355948_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Gross realized gains and losses on those sales were less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	Net unrealized holding losses during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, were less than $0.1 million and have been included in accumulated comprehensive loss during its respective fiscal year.
355948_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Discontinued Operations: During fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in, and certain liabilities of our RF, Wireless, and Power Division ( RFPD ), as well as certain other Company assets, including our information technology assets, to Arrow Electronics, Inc. ( Arrow ) in exchange for $238.8 million, ( the Transaction ).
355948_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations ( ASC 205-20 ), we reported the financial results of RFPD as a discontinued operation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	During fiscal 2017, the Company disposed of, by sale, the PACS Display business.
355948_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Based on our assessment of the criteria that must be met to qualify a disposal transaction as a discontinued operation set forth in Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, the disposal of the PACS Display business does not qualify as a discontinued operation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
355948_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in ASU 2011-08 we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
355948_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	We estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Our goodwill impairment testing follows the two-step process as defined in ASC 350.
355948_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	The first step in the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
355948_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized.
355948_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from the first step of the evaluation is allocated to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in order to determine an implied goodwill value.
355948_17_ITEM8_P38_S3	This allocation is similar to the purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting.
355948_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	If the carrying amount of the goodwill reported exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
355948_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
355948_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and technology acquired in connection with the acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
355948_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Provisions for depreciation are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
355948_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Depreciation expense was approximately $2.4 million, $2.0 million, and $1.7 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	Property, plant and equipment consist of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Construction in progress includes $1.9 million related to our Healthcare growth initiatives.
355948_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	All projects are expected to be completed before the end of fiscal 2018.
355948_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Supplemental disclosure information of the estimated useful life of the assets:
355948_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	We review all property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur which indicate a possible impairment may exist.
355948_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	We have concluded that our property, plant, and equipment as of May 27, 2017, were not impaired.
355948_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Accrued Liabilities: Accrued liabilities consist of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	(1) In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company executed a reduction in headcount to streamline operations and reduce costs and recorded $1.3 million of expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses for employee termination costs payable to terminated employees with employment and/or separation agreements with the Company.
355948_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	The changes in the severance accrual for fiscal year 2017 included provisions and payments of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Warranties: We offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture.
355948_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty.
355948_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
355948_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale.
355948_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
355948_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period, and warranty experience.
355948_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.
355948_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience, and other available evidence.
355948_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Changes in the warranty reserve during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Other Non-Current Liabilities: Other non-current liabilities of $0.7 million at May 27, 2017, and $1.0 million at May 28, 2016, primarily represent employee-benefits obligations in various non-US locations.
355948_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We measure and recognize compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options.
355948_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends.
355948_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Compensation cost is recognized using a graded-vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period.
355948_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	Share-based compensation expense totaled approximately $0.4 million during fiscal 2017, $0.5 million during fiscal 2016, and $0.7 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Stock options granted generally vest over a period of five years and have contractual terms to exercise of 10 years.
355948_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows ( in thousands, except option prices and years):
355948_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	There were 5,000 stock options exercised during fiscal 2017, with cash received of less than $0.1 million.
355948_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised totaled less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016 and $0.2 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	The weighted average fair value of stock option grants was $1.14 during fiscal 2017, $1.21 during fiscal 2016, and $3.71 during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	As of May 27, 2017, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options was approximately $0.9 million which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of approximately three to four years.
355948_17_ITEM8_P56_S4	The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during fiscal 2017 was $0.5 million.
355948_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
355948_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience commensurate with the expected term.
355948_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).
355948_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	On December 21, 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 110 stating that they will continue to accept SAB No. 107, past the original expiration date of December 31, 2007.
355948_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	For stock options granted during fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, we believe that our historical stock option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
355948_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	We utilized the Safe Harbor option, or Simplified Method, to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with SAB No. 107 for options granted.
355948_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	We intend to continue to utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with SAB No. 110 until such time that we believe that our historical stock option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.
355948_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at May 27, 2017 ( in thousands, except option prices and years ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	As of May 27, 2017, we did not have any unvested restricted shares.
355948_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Compensation effects arising from issuing stock awards have been charged against income and recorded as additional paid-in-capital in the consolidated statements of stockholder s equity during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Employees 2011 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares as incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or stock awards.
355948_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	Under this plan, 850,000 shares are reserved for future issuance.
355948_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	The Plan authorizes the granting of stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant.
355948_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	Generally, these options become exercisable over five years and expire up to 10 years from the date of grant.
355948_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Earnings per Share: We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock, and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock.
355948_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time.
355948_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
355948_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.
355948_17_ITEM8_P66_S2	Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method as prescribed in ASC 260.
355948_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The per share amounts presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss are based on the following ( amounts in thousands, except per share amounts ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Note: Common stock options that were anti-dilutive and not included in diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 were 848; 890; and 881 respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
355948_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
355948_17_ITEM8_P71_S3	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
355948_17_ITEM8_P71_S4	Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P71_S5	Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
355948_17_ITEM8_P71_S6	During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
355948_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements using a three-phase approach (assessment, conversion and implementation).
355948_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	We are in our primary assessment stage, which included identifying revenue streams, contracts and responsible parties who create and manage those accounts, quantifying the impact of identified contracts on the financial statements and identifying internal control changes.
355948_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	We are in the initial stage of our assessment phase and therefore further evaluation is needed to determine the impact on our financial statements, related disclosures and controls upon adoption.
355948_17_ITEM8_P72_S3	We expect to finalize the primary assessment phase in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
355948_17_ITEM8_P72_S4	We will complete the conversion and implementation phases during fiscal 2018 in conjunction with future interpretative guidance.
355948_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 ( ASU 2015-11 ), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
355948_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	ASU 2015-11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g., first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value.
355948_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
355948_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory.
355948_17_ITEM8_P73_S4	However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice.
355948_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
355948_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	ASU 2015-17 eliminates the prior US GAAP guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes, that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet.
355948_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	The amendments in ASU 2015-17 require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet.
355948_17_ITEM8_P75_S3	ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_17_ITEM8_P75_S4	In order to simplify presentation of deferred tax balances, the Company adopted this standard prospectively in the quarter ended August 27, 2016, which did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or stockholders equity.
355948_17_ITEM8_P75_S5	Periods prior to August 27, 2016 were not retrospectively adjusted.
355948_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases.
355948_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
355948_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
355948_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
355948_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
355948_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P78_S2	Upon adoption, the Company expects that the amounts recognized for the ROU asset and lease liability in the balance sheets may be material.
355948_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ), Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
355948_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	ASU 2016-09 introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	ASU 2016-09 will directly impact the tax administration of equity plans.
355948_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_17_ITEM8_P79_S4	Early adoption is permitted and any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
355948_17_ITEM8_P79_S5	The Company expects to adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, at which time we will evaluate the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ), Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
355948_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P80_S3	The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.
355948_17_ITEM8_P80_S4	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
355948_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	As amended, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
355948_17_ITEM8_P81_S3	An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
355948_17_ITEM8_P81_S4	An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
355948_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	ASU 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
355948_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P82_S2	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	On June 15, 2015, Richardson Electronics, Ltd ( the Company ), acquired certain assets of International Medical Equipment and Services, Inc. ( IMES ), for a purchase price of $12.2 million.
355948_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	This includes the purchase of inventory, receivables, fixed assets, and certain other assets of the Company.
355948_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company did not acquire any liabilities of IMES.
355948_17_ITEM8_P83_S3	The total consideration paid excludes transaction costs.
355948_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	IMES, based in South Carolina, provides reliable, cost-saving solutions worldwide for major brands of CT and MRI equipment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	This acquisition positions Richardson Healthcare to provide cost effective diagnostic imaging replacement parts and training to hospitals, diagnostic imaging centers, medical institutions, and independent service organizations.
355948_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	IMES offers an extensive selection of replacement parts, as well as an interactive training center, on-site test bays and experienced technicians who provide 24/7 customer support.
355948_17_ITEM8_P84_S3	Replacement parts are readily available and triple tested to provide peace of mind when uptime is critical.
355948_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	IMES core operations have remained in South Carolina.
355948_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	Richardson Healthcare plans to expand IMES replacement parts and training offerings geographically to leverage the Company s global infrastructure.
355948_17_ITEM8_P85_S2	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, IMES opened up their first foreign location in Amsterdam.
355948_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	The consideration paid by the Company to IMES at closing was $12.2 million in cash.
355948_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired at the date of the closing of the acquisition (in thousands) :
355948_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Intangible assets include trade names with an estimated life of 3 years for $0.6 million, customer relationships with an estimated life of 20 years for $2.5 million, non-compete agreements with an estimated life of 5 years for $0.2 million, and technology with an estimated life of 10 years for $0.2 million.
355948_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	Goodwill recognized represents value the Company expects to be created by combining the operations of IMES with the Company s operations, including the expansion into markets within existing business segments and geographic regions, access to new customers and potential cost savings and synergies.
355948_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Goodwill related to the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
355948_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	In connection with the acquisition of IMES, the Company also entered into an Employment, Non-Disclosure, and Non-Compete Agreement ( Employment Agreement ) with Lee A. McIntyre III as the Company s Executive Vice President, IMES.
355948_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	During the term of his employment, Mr. McIntyre will earn an annual base salary of $300,000.
355948_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	In addition to his base salary, he will be entitled to an annual bonus equal to 20% of the EBITDA of IMES provided that the EBITDA of the business is at least $2.0 million inclusive of the bonus payment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P90_S3	The annual bonus payment will terminate after five years.
355948_17_ITEM8_P90_S4	For fiscal year 2017, Lee McIntyre did not receive a bonus as the minimum EBITDA needed was not achieved.
355948_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following unaudited pro forma information represents the Company s results of operations as if the acquisitions had occurred as of June 1, 2014:
355948_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	The pro forma results have been prepared for informational purposes only and include adjustments to amortize acquired intangible assets with finite life and reflect foregone interest income on cash paid for the acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the purchases been made as of the beginning of the periods presented or of the results of operations that may occur in the future.
355948_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	The financial results for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2016, includes the financial results for IMES from June 15, 2015, through May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	The financial transactions for IMES from May 31, 2015, through June 14, 2015, were deemed immaterial for illustrating pro forma financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P93_S2	IMES net sales were $7.9 million and $7.6 million for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P93_S3	The gross profit was $3.7 million and $4.4 million, or 46.5% and 57.2% of net sales during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	There were no discontinued operations in either fiscal year 2017 or fiscal year 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	In fiscal year 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of less than $0.1 million due to an income tax audit as a result of the Transaction.
355948_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	On June 15, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the IMES facility with LDL, LLC.
355948_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Executive Vice President of IMES, Lee A. McIntyre III (former owner of IMES), has an ownership interest in LDL, LLC.
355948_17_ITEM8_P95_S2	The lease agreement provides for monthly payments over five years with total future minimum lease payments of $0.6 million.
355948_17_ITEM8_P95_S3	Rental expense related to this lease amounted to $0.1 million for the fiscal years ended May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Company shall be entitled to extend the term of the lease for a period of an additional five years by notifying the landlord in writing of its intention to do so within nine months of the expiration of the initial term.
355948_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	On October 16, 2014, the Company repurchased 50,000 Class B shares from the Richardson Wildlife Foundation, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, at a negotiated price of $9.91 per share.
355948_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	Edward Richardson, Chairman and CEO of the Company, also serves as President of the Richardson Wildlife Foundation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	These shares were repurchased pursuant to the Company s share repurchase authorization approved by its Board of Directors.
355948_17_ITEM8_P97_S3	Mr. Richardson filed a Form 4 to record the gifting of his Class B shares.
355948_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	There was $6.3 million of goodwill reported on our balance sheet at both May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P98_S1	The goodwill balance in its entirety relates to our IMES reporting unit which is included in the Healthcare segment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	Goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment, using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
355948_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	After reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in ASU 2011-08, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value for the IMES reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
355948_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Accordingly, the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test as described in FASB ASC 350-20-35 was performed.
355948_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	We performed the first step of the two step impairment test using the income method, which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital.
355948_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	The results of our goodwill impairment test as of February 26, 2017 indicated that the value of goodwill attributed to our IMES reporting unit was not impaired.
355948_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	Since the acquisition of IMES in June 2015, there have been no fundamental changes in the business or market that would indicate a significant decline in the fair value since the acquisition date.
355948_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	In the two years since acquisition, the Company has made significant investments in the IMES business, including $6 million in capital expenditures that are expected to increase IMES product offerings and result in increased future sales, operating profit and cash flows.
355948_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	Management s projections used to estimate the undiscounted cash flows included increasing sales volumes from new product offerings being developed and expanded sales into new geographies and operational improvements designed to reduce costs.
355948_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	Changes in any of the significant assumptions used, including if the Company does not successfully achieve its operating plan, which is dependent on the creation of new product offerings, can materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could result in a material non-cash impairment charge of goodwill and other long lived assets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and technology acquired in connection with our acquisitions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	Intangible assets subject to amortization as well as amortization expense are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	We determined that intangible assets were not impaired as of May 27, 2017 on the basis that no adverse events or changes in circumstances were identified that could indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	The amortization expense associated with the intangible assets subject to amortization for the next five years is presented in the following table (in thousands) :
355948_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	The amortization expense associated with the intangible assets totaled approximately $0.4 million during fiscal 2017, $0.4 million during fiscal 2016 and $0.1 million during fiscal 2015.
355948_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	The weighted average number of years of amortization expense remaining is 15.1 years.
355948_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	We lease certain warehouse and office facilities and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	Rent expense for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.9 million, $2.0 million, and $1.8 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P111_S2	Our future lease commitments for minimum rentals, including common area maintenance charges and property taxes during the next five years are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	Loss from continuing operations before income taxes includes the following components ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 consists of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The differences between income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 34% and the reported income tax provision (benefit) for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 are summarized as follows:
355948_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
355948_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect continuing operations as of May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	Significant components are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	As of May 27, 2017, we had approximately $4.2 million of net deferred tax assets related to federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards, compared to $5.7 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	Net deferred tax assets related to domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $3.0 million, compared to $2.7 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards totaled approximately $0.7 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S3	The amount of net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was $0.6 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S4	We also have a domestic net deferred tax asset of $3.8 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of May 27, 2017, compared to $0.3 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S5	The changes in balances from prior year for the federal NOL carryforwards was driven by current year taxable losses which was offset by income that was generated from a dividend from Richardson Electronics China during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S6	The dividend also drove the increase in the foreign tax credit carryforward.
355948_17_ITEM8_P116_S7	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling $5.7 million and $6.7 million as of May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016, respectively, on foreign earnings of $39.5 million and $48.7 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	The decrease year over year primarily relates to the realization of income from the Richardson Electronics China dividend which was previously accounted for at May 28, 2016 as part of our undistributed earnings liability for foreign subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM8_P117_S2	In addition, as of May 27, 2017, $6.4 million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_17_ITEM8_P117_S3	Due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated.
355948_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P118_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P118_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_17_ITEM8_P118_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_17_ITEM8_P118_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	As of May 27, 2017, a valuation allowance of $8.5 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	There has been an increase in the valuation allowance from May 28, 2016 in the amount of $2.6 million.
355948_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings, and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_17_ITEM8_P120_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.4 million, $0.7 million, and $0.5 million, during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2007 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P122_S2	We are under examination in the state of Illinois for fiscal years 2011 through 2013.
355948_17_ITEM8_P122_S3	We are currently under examination in Germany (fiscal 2011 through 2014) and Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011).
355948_17_ITEM8_P122_S4	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_17_ITEM8_P122_S5	We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2011 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2011.
355948_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	The uncertain tax positions from continuing operations as of May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016, totaled $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
355948_17_ITEM8_P124_S1	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months for which an amount can be determined.
355948_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	The following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits for continuing and discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):
355948_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	Relates to an amended Illinois state income tax return related to the sale of RFPD.
355948_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	The employee profit sharing plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan for employees.
355948_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	The profit sharing plan has a 401(k) provision whereby we match 50% of employee contributions up to 4.0% of pay.
355948_17_ITEM8_P128_S2	The Company suspended the match component for fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM8_P128_S3	Charges to expense for matching contributions to this plan were $0.0 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Healthcare.
355948_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging.
355948_17_ITEM8_P130_S1	Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with OEM and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians.
355948_17_ITEM8_P130_S2	With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity.
355948_17_ITEM8_P130_S3	Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile Healthcare industry.
355948_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	In accordance with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , we have identified three reportable segments: PMT and Canvys, and Healthcare.
355948_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	The Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ), formerly called the Electron Device Group ( EDG ), prior to July 2015, provides engineered solutions and distributes electronic components to customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology.
355948_17_ITEM8_P132_S2	PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and medical OEM markets.
355948_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	Healthcare manufactures, refurbishes and distributes high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, asset management companies, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers.
355948_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	Products include Diagnostic Imaging replacement parts including CT and MRI tubes, hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; replacement flat panel detectors and upgrades; and additional replacement components currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.
355948_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	The CEO evaluates performance and allocates resources primarily based on the gross profit of each segment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	Operating results by segment are summarized in the following table ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	A reconciliation of assets to the relevant consolidated amount is as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	Other current assets include miscellaneous receivables, prepaid expenses, and current deferred income taxes.
355948_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	Assets are not disclosed by reportable segment as the Company does not track assets by reportable segment and certain assets are not specific to any reportable segment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	Capital expenditures for our Healthcare segment during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were approximately $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P141_S1	In addition, we also had capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 related to the Company s new ERP system that are not specific to any particular reportable segment.
355948_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	Geographic net sales information is primarily grouped by customer destination into five areas: North America; Asia/Pacific; Europe; Latin America; and Other.
355948_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	Net sales and gross profit by geographic region are summarized in the following table ( in thousands ):
355948_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	Other primarily includes net sales not allocated to a specific geographical region, unabsorbed value-add costs, and other unallocated expenses.

355948_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	Net assets by geographic region are summarized in the following table (in thousands):
355948_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	The Company has long-lived assets of $19.3 million as of May 27, 2017 and $16.8 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P147_S1	The long-lived assets, which include our fixed assets and intangibles, are primarily in the US.
355948_17_ITEM8_P147_S2	There are approximately $1.2 million of long-lived assets that belong to our foreign affiliates as of May 27, 2017 and $1.3 million as of May 28, 2016.
355948_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Company had depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million, $2.4 million and $1.7 million for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.
355948_17_ITEM8_P148_S1	The depreciation and amortization, which includes our fixed assets and intangibles, are primarily in the US.

355948_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	We are involved in several pending judicial proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
355948_17_ITEM8_P149_S1	While the outcome of litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on information available at the time the financial statements were issued, we determined disclosure of contingencies relating to any of our pending judicial proceedings was not necessary because there was less than a reasonable possibility that a material loss had been incurred.
355948_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
355948_17_ITEM8_P151_S1	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
355948_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	As of May 27, 2017, we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
355948_17_ITEM8_P152_S1	Our investments consist of time deposits and CDs, where face value is equal to fair value, and equity securities of publicly traded companies for which market prices are readily available.
355948_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016, were as follows ( in thousands ):

355948_17_ITEM8_P159_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
355948_17_ITEM8_P159_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
355948_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
355948_17_ITEM8_P160_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
355948_17_ITEM8_P160_S2	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
355948_17_ITEM8_P160_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. at May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 27, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

355948_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	We have audited Richardson Electronics, Ltd. s internal control over financial reporting as of May 27, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
355948_17_ITEM8_P163_S1	Richardson Electronics, Ltd. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .

355948_17_ITEM8_P164_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
355948_17_ITEM8_P164_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
355948_17_ITEM8_P164_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
355948_17_ITEM8_P164_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_17_ITEM8_P165_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_17_ITEM8_P166_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	In our opinion, Richardson Electronics, Ltd. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 27, 2017, based on the COSO criteria .
355948_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. as of May 27, 2017 and May 28, 2016 and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 27, 2017 and our report dated July 31, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
355948_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 27, 2017, based on the framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
355948_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 27, 2017, has been audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
355948_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
355948_17_ITEM9B_P0_S0	On July 19, 2017, we issued a press release reporting results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, and the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend.

355948_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	LaFox, IL, July 19, 2017: Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (NASDAQ: RELL) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 27, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.06 per share quarterly cash dividend.
355948_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $37.4 million compared to net sales of $39.6 million in the prior year s fourth quarter.
355948_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	Sales decreased $1.3 million for PMT, primarily due to a large government sale in the fourth quarter of 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P44_S2	PMT sales were higher in power conversion and RF and microwave components as well as specialty products sold into the semiconductor capital equipment market.
355948_17_ITEM15_P44_S3	Sales decreased by $0.9 million for Richardson Healthcare and sales were flat for Canvys as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	Gross margin decreased to $12.0 million, or 32.1% of net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $13.4 million, or 33.8% of net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	Margin declined as a percent of net sales primarily due to an unfavorable product mix in both PMT and Richardson Healthcare.
355948_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Operating expenses decreased to $12.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $13.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	The decrease was due to reduced salaries, benefits and incentive compensation expenses relating to the reduction in force and changes to the incentive structure earlier in fiscal 2017.
355948_17_ITEM15_P46_S2	In addition, IT expenses were lower than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P46_S3	These reductions were partially offset by $0.2 million in higher research and development expenses for Richardson Healthcare.
355948_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	In addition, there was a $0.2 million gain on the divestiture of the PACS Displays business completed in May 2017.
355948_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	As a result, the company reported $39,000 of operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million in the prior year s fourth quarter.
355948_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Other expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily foreign exchange, was $0.2 million, compared to less than $0.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	The income tax benefit of less than $0.1 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 reflected an adjustment to a tax reserve due to an expired statute of limitations, an adjustment to the provision for foreign income taxes and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss.
355948_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $0.1 million, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 were $136.9 million, a decrease of 3.6%, compared to net sales of $142.0 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	Sales decreased by $2.9 million for Canvys, primarily due to declines in demand from key customers relating to market conditions.
355948_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	Sales for PMT decreased by $1.3 million due to the large government sale in fiscal 2016 that was not repeated in fiscal 2017, partially offset by sales from new niche technology suppliers.
355948_17_ITEM15_P52_S3	Sales for Richardson Healthcare decreased by $0.9 million as a result of lower sales in the PACS Displays business, which was divested on May 25, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	Gross profit decreased to $43.9 million, compared to $44.8 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	However, gross margin increased to 32.1% of net sales for fiscal 2017, compared to 31.6% of net sales for fiscal 2016, mostly as a result of an improved product mix.
355948_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	Operating expenses decreased to $49.9 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $51.6 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	Fiscal 2017 included $1.3 million in severance expense associated with the reduction in work force during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which was more than offset by reduced salaries and incentive compensation expenses.
355948_17_ITEM15_P54_S2	In addition, IT expenses were nearly $0.9 million lower than fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P54_S3	These reductions were partially offset by $0.5 million in higher research and development expenses for Richardson Healthcare.
355948_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	Operating loss for fiscal 2017 was $5.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $6.6 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	After excluding the severance expense of $1.3 million, the operating loss would have been $4.5 million for fiscal year 2017.
355948_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Other expense for fiscal 2017, including foreign exchange, was $0.4 million, compared to other income of $0.3 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	The income tax provision of $0.8 million for fiscal 2017 reflected a provision for foreign income taxes and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss.
355948_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	Net loss for fiscal 2017 was $6.9 million, compared to a net loss of $6.8 million for fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a $0.06 quarterly dividend per share to holders of common stock and a $0.054 cash dividend per share to holders of Class B common stock.
355948_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The dividend will be payable on August 24, 2017, to common stockholders of record on August 7, 2017.
355948_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	Cash and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $64.2 million compared to $60.2 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and $70.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under the existing share repurchase authorization.
355948_17_ITEM15_P60_S2	Since the sale of RFPD, the Company has spent $65.6 million on share repurchases, nearly $20.0 million on acquisitions, approximately $20.0 million on dividends and $7.3 million on purchases of Richardson Healthcare equipment.
355948_17_ITEM15_P60_S3	Currently, there are 10.7 million outstanding shares of common stock and 2.1 million outstanding shares of Class B common stock.
355948_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	I am pleased to report an operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to a $0.3 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, said Edward J. Richardson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President.
355948_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	The improvement in overall financial results, including generating an additional $4.0 million in cash flow from operations, is a direct result of our ongoing initiatives aimed at growing revenue, permanently reducing expenses and improving cash flow.
355948_17_ITEM15_P61_S2	We will continue to operate conservatively and preserve cash for investments in areas that will help return the company to profitability, Mr. Richardson concluded.

355948_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
355948_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ) combines our core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies.
355948_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	As a manufacturer and authorized distributor, PMT s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities.
355948_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair all through our existing global infrastructure.
355948_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	PMT s focus is on products for power, RF and microwave applications for customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets.
355948_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar and radiation oncology.
355948_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
355948_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	PMT represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and solid-state components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, RF and wireless and industrial power applications.
355948_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Among the suppliers they support are Amperex, CDE, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, MACOM, National, NJRC, Ohmite, Qorvo, Thales, Toshiba and Vishay.
355948_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	PMT s inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment and new technologies.
355948_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	PMT also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology.
355948_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, PMT is increasing its market share.
355948_18_ITEM1_P10_S3	PMT often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases.
355948_18_ITEM1_P10_S4	As manufacturers for these products exit the business, PMT has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
355948_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	PMT has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights which often include global coverage.
355948_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches which are not cured within a reasonable period of time.
355948_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	Although some of these agreements allow PMT to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case PMT may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
355948_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	PMT s suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to PMT by its customers.
355948_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including: Amperex , Cetron and National .
355948_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators and liquid crystal display monitors.
355948_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics and a wide variety of fabricated metal components.
355948_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.
355948_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial and medical original equipment manufacturers markets.
355948_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our engineers design, manufacture, source and support a full spectrum of solutions to match the needs of our customers.
355948_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	We offer long term availability and proven custom display solutions that include touch screens, protective panels, custom enclosures, all-in-ones, specialized cabinet finishes and application specific software packages and certification services.
355948_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our volume commitments are lower than those of the large display manufacturers, making us the ideal choice for companies with very specific design requirements.
355948_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	We partner with both private label manufacturing companies and leading branded hardware vendors to offer the highest quality display and touch solutions and customized computing platforms.
355948_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have long-standing relationships with key component and finished goods manufacturers and several key ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 certified Asian display manufacturers that manufacture products to our specifications.
355948_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe supplier relationships, combined with our engineering design and manufacturing capabilities and private label partnerships, allow us to maintain a well-balanced and technologically advanced offering of customer specific display solutions.
355948_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Healthcare manufactures, refurbishes and distributes high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, asset management companies, independent service organizations and multi-vendor service providers.
355948_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Products include Diagnostic Imaging replacement parts for CT and MRI systems; replacement CT and MRI tubes; CT service training; MRI coils, cold heads and RF amplifiers; hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; flat panel detector upgrades; and additional replacement solutions currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.
355948_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
355948_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	We have employees, as well as authorized representatives, who are not our employees, selling our products primarily in regions where we do not have a direct sales presence.
355948_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	We offer various credit terms to qualifying customers as well as cash in advance and credit card terms.
355948_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	We establish credit limits for each customer and routinely review delinquent and aging accounts.
355948_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	We maintain approximately 110,700 part numbers in our product inventory database and we estimate that more than 90% of orders received by 6:00 p.m. local time are shipped complete the same day for stock product.
355948_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Customers can access our products on our web sites, www.rell.com , www.rellhealthcare.com, www.canvys.com, www.rellpower.com and www.rellaser.com, through electronic data interchange, or by telephone.
355948_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Customer orders are processed by our regional sales offices and supported primarily by one of our distribution facilities in LaFox, Illinois; Fort Mill, South Carolina; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Marlborough, Massachusetts; Donaueschingen, Germany; or Singapore, Singapore.
355948_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	We also have satellite warehouses in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Shanghai, China; Bangkok, Thailand; and Hook, United Kingdom.
355948_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our data processing network provides on-line, real-time interconnection of all sales offices and central distribution operations, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
355948_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Information on stock availability, pricing in local currency, cross-reference information, customers and market analyses are obtainable throughout the entire distribution network.
355948_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	During fiscal 2018, we made approximately 59% of our sales outside the U.S.
355948_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	We continue to pursue new international sales to further expand our geographic reach.
355948_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	During fiscal 2018, LAM Research Corporation individually accounted for 11 percent of the Company s consolidated net sales.
355948_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018.
355948_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	No one customer accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	The Company believes that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
355948_18_ITEM1_P24_S4	See Note 11 Segment and Geographic Information of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	As of June 2, 2018, we employed 421 individuals.
355948_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	All of our employees are non-union and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
355948_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We maintain an Internet website at www.rell.com .
355948_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 are accessible through our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
355948_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	Interactive Data Files pursuant to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T, of these filing dates, formatted in Extensible Business Reporting Language ( XBRL ) are accessible as well.
355948_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	To access these reports, go to our website at www.rell.com .
355948_18_ITEM1_P26_S4	The foregoing information regarding our website is provided for convenience and the content of our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should consider carefully the following risk factors in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we believe are applicable to our businesses and the industries in which we operate.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our businesses, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and investments are held by our foreign subsidiaries and could affect future liquidity needs.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As of June 2, 2018, $34.6 million, or approximately 57% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Some of these subsidiaries are located in jurisdictions that require foreign government approval before a cash repatriation can occur.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, under current tax law, repatriation of this cash may trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the U.S.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our liquidity requirements could necessitate transfers of existing cash balances between our subsidiaries or to the United States.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	While we intend to use some of the cash held outside the United States to fund our international operations and growth, when we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that we cannot fulfill through other internal or external sources, we may experience unfavorable tax, earnings and liquidity consequences due to cash transfers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These adverse consequences would occur, for example, if the transfer of cash into the United Sates is taxed and no offsetting foreign tax credit or net operating loss carryforward is available to offset the U.S. tax liability, resulting in lower earnings and liquidity.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may not achieve our plan for sales growth and margin targets.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have established both margin and expense targets to grow our sales with new and existing customers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to leverage our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:
355948_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our growth objectives.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence, and may incur similar charges in the future.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our products generally support industrial machinery powered by tube technology.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As technology evolves and companies replace this capital equipment, the market for our products potentially declines.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, the market for many of our other products changes rapidly resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we do not accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products that we may be unable to sell or return to our vendors.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	This may result in a decline in the value of our inventory.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We face competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There are very few vacuum tube competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	There are also a limited number of Chinese manufacturers whose ability to produce vacuum tubes has progressed over the past several years.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The most significant competitive risk comes from technical obsolescence.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Canvys faces many competitors in the markets we serve.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As we expand our business and pursue our growth initiatives, we may encounter increased competition from current and/or new competitors.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A single stockholder has voting control over us.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As of July 23, 2018, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 66% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests, and other significant corporate transactions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply us with essential products.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our principal products are capacitors, vacuum tubes and related products, microwave generators and high voltage power supplies.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The products we supply are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	One of our suppliers represented 15 percent of our total cost of sales.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	To the extent that our significant suppliers are unwilling or unable to continue to do business with us, extend lead times, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of risks that could impact our results.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, and changes in tax laws.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the United States.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the base currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income would decrease.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings in the future to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives, which would dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations and our broader corporate initiatives, such as stock repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and other strategic opportunities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we are unable to, or choose not to, repatriate our overseas cash.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders ownership interests in us.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Furthermore, lenders may not agree to extend us new, additional or continuing credit.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In a non-binding referendum on the United Kingdom s membership in the European Union ( EU ) in June 2016, a majority of those who voted approved the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the EU.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Any withdrawal by the United Kingdom from the EU ( Brexit ) would occur after, or possible concurrently with, a process of negotiation regarding the future terms of the United Kingdom s relationship with the EU, which could result in the United Kingdom losing access to certain aspects of the single EU market and the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The Brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the EU and elsewhere.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, political systems or financial institutions and the financial and monetary system.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Given that we conduct a substantial portion of our business in the EU, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	The uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit could also have a negative impact on the growth of the European economy and cause greater volatility in all of the global currencies that we currently use to transact business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We rely heavily on information technology systems that, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We rely on our information technology systems to process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase, manufacture, and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill, and ship orders on a timely basis.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	A significant disruption or failure in the design, operation, security or support of our information technology systems could significantly disrupt our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our information technology systems may be subject to cyber attacks, security breaches or computer hacking.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Our systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and its data, as well as the data of our business partners.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The costs to mitigate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about us, our business partners or other third parties could expose us to significant potential liability and reputational harm.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As threats related to cyber attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our profitability.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	As a global enterprise, we could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our products may be found to be defective or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We sell many of our components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Since a defect or failure in a product could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We extend credit to our customers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management s evaluation of factors that include such things as a customer s financial condition, payment history, and the availability of collateral to secure customers receivables.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Failure to successfully implement our growth initiatives, or failure to realize the benefits expected from these initiatives if implemented, may create ongoing operating losses or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our growth strategy focuses on expanding our healthcare and our power conversion businesses.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	On June 15, 2015, we acquired certain assets, including inventory, receivables, fixed assets, and certain other assets, of International Medical Equipment and Services, Inc. ( IMES ), for a purchase price of $12.2 million.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In July 2015, we launched Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ), which combines our core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may be unable to implement our growth initiatives or reach profitability in the near future or at all, due to many factors, including factors outside of our control.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	If our investments in these growth initiatives do not yield anticipated returns for any reason, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As part of our growth strategy, our intent is to acquire additional businesses or assets.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition, and integrating the operations, personnel and systems of the acquired businesses.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past, and may in the future, result in decreased revenues and gross profit margins.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Economic uncertainty also makes it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our operating results during fiscal 2017 reflect a net loss, while we are reporting net income for fiscal 2018.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	There can be no assurance that we will continue recovery in the near future; nor is there any assurance that such worldwide economic volatility experienced recently will not continue.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Major disruptions to our logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We operate our global logistics services through specialized and centralized distribution centers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers for any reason (such as natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	From time to time, third parties, including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers, may assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for our self and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our management s attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We may have to stop selling certain products or certain technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We currently have significant cash and investments.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If we are deemed to be an investment company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The company s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We ascribe value to certain intangible assets, which consist of customer lists and trade names resulting from acquisitions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We may incur an impairment charge on goodwill or on intangible assets if we determine that the fair value of the intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We evaluate whether events have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may no longer be recoverable.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	If this is the case, an impairment charge to earnings would be necessary.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We may incur substantial operational costs or be required to change our business practices to comply with the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) which went into effect in May 2018.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union, including more robust documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Specifically, the GDPR introduced numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including greater control for data subjects, increased data portability for EU consumers, and data breach notification requirements.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Although GDPR has already gone into effect, there is still considerable uncertainty as to how to interpret and implement many of its provisions.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Complying with the GDPR may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices in ways that we cannot currently predict.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Despite our efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, data subjects or others.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, may be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR s requirements.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	New tariffs and the evolving trade policy dispute between the United States and China may adversely affect our business.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	On August 14, 2017, President Trump instructed the U.S. Trade Representative ( USTR ) to determine under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act ) whether to investigate China s law, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation or technology development.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	On March 22, 2018, based upon the results of its investigation, the USTR published a report finding that the acts, policies and practices of the Chinese government are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	On March 8, 2018, President Trump imposed significant tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from a number of countries, including China.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Subsequently, the USTR announced an initial proposed list of 1,300 goods imported from China that could be subject to additional tariffs and initiated a dispute with the World Trade Organization against China for alleged unfair trade practices.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	On June 15, 2018, the USTR announced a list of products subject to additional tariffs.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The list focused on products from industrial sectors that contribute to or benefit from the Made in China 2025 industrial policy.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The list of products consists of two sets of tariff lines.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The first set contains 818 tariff lines for which Customs and Border Protection will begin collecting the additional duties on July 6, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	This list includes some of our products.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The second set contains 284 proposed tariff lines that remain subject to further review.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	These new tariffs and the evolving trade policy dispute between the United States and China may have a significant impact on the industries in which we participate.
355948_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	A trade war between the United States and China or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the United States economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses and results of operations.
355948_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns one facility and leases 27 facilities.
355948_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own our corporate facility and largest distribution center, which is located on approximately 100 acres in LaFox, Illinois and consists of approximately 242,000 square feet of manufacturing, warehouse and office space.
355948_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	We maintain geographically diverse facilities because we believe this provides value to our customers and suppliers, and limits market risk and exchange rate exposure.
355948_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our properties are well maintained and adequate for our present needs.
355948_18_ITEM2_P0_S4	The extent of utilization varies from property to property and from time to time during the year.
355948_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our facility locations, their primary use, and segments served are as follows:
355948_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	LaFox, Illinois is also the location of our corporate headquarters.
355948_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	Sold building June 12, 2017, currently lease separate facility.
355948_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	On December 5, 2017, Steven H. Busch filed a Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint against Edward J. Richardson, Paul Plante, Jacques Belin, James Benham, Kenneth Halverson, and the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Steven H. Busch v. Edward J. Richardson, et al. , C.A. No. 2017-0868-AGB.
355948_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the Company s directors and challenges the decision of a special committee of the Company s Board to refuse Mr. Busch s demand that the Company s Board, among other things, rescind the Company s May 2013 repurchase of stock from Mr. Richardson and May 2013 and October 2014 repurchases of Company stock from the Richardson Wildlife Foundation.
355948_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	On March 9, 2018, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit; these motions are currently pending.
355948_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	The Company believes the lawsuit to be without merit and that a loss is not probable or estimable based on the information available at the time the financial statements were issued.
355948_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	There were no share repurchases in fiscal 2018.
355948_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our quarterly dividend was $0.06 per common share and $0.054 per Class B common share.
355948_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	Annual dividend payments for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were approximately $3.0 million.
355948_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_18_ITEM5_P1_S3	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ) under the trading symbol ( RELL ).
355948_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.
355948_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	As of July 23, 2018, there were approximately 547 stockholders of record for the common stock and approximately 15 stockholders of record for the Class B common stock.
355948_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low closing sales price per share of RELL common stock as reported on the NASDAQ for the periods indicated.
355948_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph compares the performance of our common stock for the periods indicated with the performance of the NASDAQ Composite Index and NASDAQ Electronic Components Index.

355948_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	This included the purchase of inventory, receivables, fixed assets, and certain other assets of the Company.
355948_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company did not acquire any liabilities of IMES.

355948_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	IMES core operations have remained in South Carolina.
355948_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Richardson Healthcare plans to expand IMES replacement parts and training offerings geographically leveraging the Company s global infrastructure.
355948_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, IMES opened up their first foreign location in Amsterdam.
355948_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
355948_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Power and Microwave Technologies Group ( PMT ) combines our core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies.

355948_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Gross margin during fiscal 2017 included expense related to inventory provisions for PMT of $0.4 million, $0.1 million for Canvys, and less than $0.1 million for Healthcare.
355948_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	Gross margin during fiscal 2016 included expense related to inventory provisions for PMT of $0.3 million, $0.4 million for Canvys, and less than $0.1 million for Healthcare.
355948_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net sales for PMT increased 23.1% to $128.3 million during fiscal 2018, from $104.2 million during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	This growth was led by products sold into the semiconductor wafer fab equipment market and from new technology suppliers in key RF, Microwave and Power markets such as 5G infrastructure and power management applications.
355948_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Power grid tube sales also increased.
355948_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.7% during fiscal 2018 as compared to 32.0% during fiscal 2017, primarily due to product mix and improved manufacturing absorption.
355948_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net sales for PMT decreased 1.3% to $104.2 million during fiscal 2017, from $105.6 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	In fiscal 2016, we recognized a large tube order for a military application that was mostly offset in fiscal 2017 by new technology suppliers in the RF, microwave and power market as well as increases in manufactured products associated with growth in the semiconductor wafer fab market.
355948_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.0% during fiscal 2017 as compared to 31.3% during fiscal 2016, primarily due to product mix and improved manufacturing absorption.
355948_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net sales for Canvys increased 29.9% to $26.7 million during fiscal 2018, from $20.5 million during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Sales were up in both Europe and North America due to the addition of new customers and programs and strong demand from existing customers throughout the year.
355948_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.5% during fiscal 2018 as compared to 28.0% during fiscal 2017, primarily due to product mix and foreign currency effects.
355948_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Net sales for Canvys decreased 12.4% to $20.5 million during fiscal 2017, from $23.5 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Sales in North America were down due to customer delays in new program rollouts.
355948_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 28.0% during fiscal 2017 as compared to 25.7% during fiscal 2016, primarily due to product mix and lower inventory reserves.
355948_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net sales for Healthcare decreased 32.0% to $8.2 million during fiscal 2018, from $12.1 million during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The reduction in sales was primarily due to the sale of the PACS display business at the end of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The PACS display business had $4.1 million of sales in fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	This decline was slightly offset by an increase in sales in our core Healthcare business.
355948_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 41.5% during fiscal 2018, compared to 39.2% during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P26_S5	This increase was due to the sale of our PACS display business, which generated lower margins than our core Healthcare business.
355948_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net sales for Healthcare decreased 6.9% to $12.1 million during fiscal 2017, from $13.0 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The reduction in sales was due to a decline in the PACS display business, which we divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	This decline was slightly offset by an increase in sales in our core Healthcare business including diagnostic imaging replacement parts and CT tubes.
355948_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39.2% during fiscal 2017, compared to 44.0% during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	This decrease was primarily due to change in product mix that included a significant increase year over year in IMES equipment sales, which yield lower margins than replacement parts and CT tubes, in addition to continued pricing pressure on replacement parts resulting in lower margins.
355948_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	On a geographic basis, our sales are categorized by destination: North America; Asia/Pacific; Europe; Latin America; and Other.
355948_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net sales by geographic area and percent change for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Gross profit by geographic area and percent of geographic net sales for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows ( in thousands ):
355948_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Other primarily includes net sales not allocated to a specific geographical region, unabsorbed value-add costs and other unallocated expenses.
355948_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	We sell our products to customers in diversified industries and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition.
355948_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.
355948_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Estimates of credit losses are recorded in the financial statements based on monthly reviews of outstanding accounts.
355948_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) increased during fiscal 2018 to $51.7 million from $49.9 million during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 31.7% during fiscal 2018 as compared to 36.4% during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	The increase in expense was due to higher compensation and other expenses mostly related to the increase in net sales as well as higher research and development costs and other incremental expenses to support our growth strategies in Richardson Healthcare.
355948_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company had a $1.3 million charge for severance expense related to a reduction in workforce.
355948_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) decreased during fiscal 2017 to $49.9 million from $51.6 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	SG&A as a percentage of sales remained flat at 36.4% during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The decrease was due to lower salaries and incentive compensation expenses from workforce reductions, and a reduction of IT expenses compared to fiscal 2016, mostly offset by $1.3 million of severance expense related to a reduction in workforce during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	In addition, research and development expenses for Richardson Healthcare increased by $0.5 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Other income/expense was income of $0.2 million during fiscal 2018, compared to expense of $0.4 million during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Fiscal 2018 included $0.4 million of investment income, partially offset by $0.2 million of foreign exchange losses.
355948_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Fiscal 2017 included $0.2 million of investment income, offset by $0.6 million of foreign exchange losses.
355948_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities.
355948_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.
355948_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our income tax provision from continuing operations during fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	The effective income tax rates from continuing operations during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 39.7%, (13.3)% and (8.8)%, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 29.2% during 2018 and 34% during 2017 and 2016 is primarily driven by the impact of recording a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets, repatriation of foreign earnings, changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss) and our recording of uncertain tax positions with respect to ASC 740-30, Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas ( ASC 740-30 ).
355948_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted new tax legislation, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ).
355948_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The primary provisions of the Act expected to impact the Company in fiscal 2018 are a reduction to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a transition from a worldwide corporate tax system to a territorial tax system.
355948_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	The reduction in the corporate income tax rate requires the Company to remeasure its net deferred tax assets to the new corporate tax rate and the transition to a territorial tax system requires payment of a one-time tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed and previously untaxed non-U.S. earnings.
355948_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Primarily as a result of those provisions of the Act, the Company recorded a deferred remeasurement impact of approximately $1.6 million, which was fully offset by the valuation allowance movement.
355948_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	Additionally, the estimated deemed earnings repatriation tax, net of available foreign tax credits brought back as part of the deemed repatriation, was $3.5 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	The Company does not anticipate any cash tax payments due to the foreign tax credit carryforwards available to fully offset the provisional deemed repatriation tax.
355948_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	The 21% corporate income tax rate was effective January 1, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	Based on the Company s June 2, 2018 fiscal year end, the U.S. statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 29.2%.
355948_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The tax impact recorded for the Act for fiscal 2018 is provisional as outlined below and may change.
355948_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company completed a preliminary assessment of earnings that could be repatriated based on reinvestment needs of non-U.S. operations and earnings available for repatriation.
355948_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The estimated withholding tax that would be incurred from the repatriation of those earnings was included in fiscal 2018 provisional income tax expense.
355948_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company continues to analyze the provisions of the Act addressing the net deferred tax asset remeasurement and its calculations, the deemed earnings repatriation, including the determination of undistributed non-U.S. earnings, and evaluate potential Company actions.
355948_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	In addition, the Company continues to monitor potential legislative action and regulatory interpretations of the Act.
355948_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Based on the effective date of certain provisions, the Company will be subject to additional requirements of the Act beginning in fiscal 2019.
355948_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Those provisions include a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), a tax determined by base erosion and anti-avoidance tax (BEAT) related to certain payments between a U.S. corporation and foreign related entities, a limitation of certain executive compensation, a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII) and interest expense limitations.
355948_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company has not completed its analysis of those provisions and the estimated impact.
355948_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	The Company also has not determined its accounting policy to treat the taxes due on GILTI as a period cost or include in the determination of deferred taxes.
355948_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 that allows for a measurement period up to one year after the enactment date of the Act to complete the accounting requirements.
355948_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Company will complete the adjustments related to the Act within the allowed period.
355948_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	As of June 2, 2018, we had approximately $3.4 million of net deferred tax assets related to federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards, compared to $4.2 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	Net deferred tax assets related to domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $3.9 million as of June 2, 2018, compared to $3.0 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards as of June 2, 2018 totaled approximately $0.6 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	The amount of net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was $0.7 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	We also have a domestic net deferred tax asset of $0.5 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of June 2, 2018, compared to $3.8 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P44_S5	The changes in balances from prior year are generally due to the transition tax that was part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for which the deemed inclusion on foreign earnings utilized most of the foreign tax credit carryforwards available.
355948_18_ITEM7_P44_S6	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	We have historically determined that undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S.
355948_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	We repatriated $21.2 million of foreign cash to our U.S. parent company in fiscal 2018, $17.7 million from our Hong Kong entity and the remainder from our entities in Singapore, Italy and Taiwan.
355948_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	Due to the deemed repatriation tax, the untaxed outside basis difference for which the historic balance has primarily related has been reduced.
355948_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	The deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference is now primarily withholding tax on future dividend distributions.
355948_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	Accordingly, we have reduced the deferred tax liability from $5.7 million in fiscal 2017 to be $0.3 million in fiscal 2018 on foreign earnings of $28.6 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_18_ITEM7_P46_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	As of June 2, 2018, a valuation allowance of $9.1 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	There has been an increase in the valuation allowance from May 27, 2017 in the amount of $0.6 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million, during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2010 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	We are currently under examination in Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011).
355948_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	We are also under examination in the state of Illinois for fiscal years 2014 and 2015.
355948_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2015 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2012.
355948_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	The uncertain tax positions from continuing operations as of June 2, 2018 and May 27, 2017 were $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	We record penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
355948_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.
355948_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	We have not recorded a liability for interest and penalties as of June 2, 2018 or May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next 12 months.
355948_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	On September 12, 2017, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois of approximately $2.0 million, which included interest earned.
355948_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division ( RFPD ) in 2011.
355948_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	A net benefit of $1.5 million, which included $0.5 million of professional fee costs incurred to pursue the refund, was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in discontinued operations.
355948_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	On September 12, 2017, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois of approximately $2.0 million, which included interest earned.
355948_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division in 2011.
355948_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	A net benefit of $1.5 million, which included $0.5 million of professional fee costs incurred to pursue the refund, was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in discontinued operations.
355948_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	Refer to Note 5 Discontinued Operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our operations and cash needs have been primarily financed through income from operations and cash on hand.
355948_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Cash and cash equivalents were $60.5 million at June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Cash and cash equivalents at June 2, 2018, consisted of $26.5 million in North America, $20.2 million in Europe, $1.0 million in Latin America and $12.8 million in Asia/Pacific.
355948_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	We repatriated $21.2 million of foreign cash to our U.S. parent company in fiscal 2018, $17.7 million from our Hong Kong entity and the remainder from our entities in Singapore, Italy and Taiwan.
355948_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cash and cash equivalents were $55.4 million at May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Investments including CDs and time deposits classified as short-term investments were $6.4 million, and long-term investments were $2.4 million including equity securities of $0.6 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Cash and investments at May 27, 2017, consisted of $16.3 million in North America, $15.5 million in Europe, $1.5 million in Latin America and $30.9 million in Asia/Pacific.
355948_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed a cash repatriation of $11.3 million, which included a return of capital and dividend from our Chinese entity to our U.S. parent company.
355948_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	We believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months.
355948_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Positive cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from our net income, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Operating activities provided $3.0 million of cash during fiscal 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	We had net income of $3.8 million during fiscal 2018, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards and restricted stock awards, $0.8 million of inventory provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $3.0 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $5.0 million during fiscal 2018, primarily due to the increase in inventories of $8.2 million, the increase in accounts receivable of $1.8 million and the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.6 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	These uses of cash were partially offset by the increase in our accounts payable of $3.5 million and the increase in accrued liabilities of $1.9 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	The inventory increase was due to the ongoing growth of our RF and power technologies business, increase in raw material and work in process supporting the semiconductor capital equipment market and growth in supplying replacement systems and parts to the Healthcare market.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S5	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in sales.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S6	The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in our accrual for inventory in transit from vendors as well as timing of payments for some of our larger vendors for both inventory and services.
355948_18_ITEM7_P61_S7	The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to higher compensation accruals mostly related to the increase in net sales.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Operating activities provided $1.8 million of cash during fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	We had net loss of $6.9 million during fiscal 2017, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards, $0.5 million of inventory provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities was $5.4 million during fiscal 2017, due primarily to the decrease in accounts receivable of $4.2 million, the decrease in inventories of $2.4 million, the increase in our accounts payable of $1.0 million, partially offset by the decrease in accrued liabilities of $0.7 million and the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.3 million.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	The decrease in, or cash provided by, our inventory was primarily due to key supply chain efforts to reduce and manage inventory levels.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the collection of a large receivable during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that was invoiced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S5	The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in our accrual for inventory in transit from vendors.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S6	The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to a reduction in incentive accruals and an asset retirement obligation in France.
355948_18_ITEM7_P62_S7	The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was due to investments in our Healthcare segment and other receivables with a supplier and for the sale of assets.
355948_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	The cash flow from investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments and capital expenditures.
355948_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Cash provided by investing activities of $4.2 million during fiscal 2018 included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $12.3 million, partially offset by the purchases of investments of $3.9 million and $5.2 million in capital expenditures.
355948_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Capital expenditures relate primarily to our Healthcare growth initiative, a new roof for part of our warehouse and capital used for our IT system.
355948_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Cash used in investing activities of $3.8 million during fiscal 2017, which included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $3.6 million, offset by the purchases of investments of $2.2 million and $5.2 million in capital expenditures.
355948_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	Capital expenditures relates primarily to our Healthcare growth initiatives and capital equipment and software for our new IT system.
355948_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our purchases and proceeds from investments consist of time deposits and CDs.
355948_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
355948_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The cash flow from financing activities primarily consists of cash dividends paid.
355948_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Cash used in financing activities of $3.0 million during fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from cash used to pay dividends.
355948_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $3.0 million for dividend payments.
355948_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
355948_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
355948_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Contractual obligations by expiration period are presented in the table below as of June 2, 2018 ( in thousands ):
355948_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies and income taxes.
355948_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and the results of operations.
355948_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
355948_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; and collectability and delinquency history by geographic area.
355948_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.3 million as of June 2, 2018 and $0.4 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_18_ITEM7_P77_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our consolidated inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Our net inventories include approximately $42.6 million of finished goods, $5.7 million of raw materials and $2.4 million of work-in-progress as of June 2, 2018, as compared to approximately $36.0 million of finished goods, $5.3 million of raw materials and $1.4 million of work-in-progress as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	The inventory reserve as of June 2, 2018 was $4.0 million compared to $3.5 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	At this time, we do not anticipate any material risks or uncertainties related to possible future inventory write-downs.
355948_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	If future demand changes in an industry or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The provisions were primarily for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	There was $6.3 million of goodwill reported on our balance sheet at both June 2, 2018 and May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The goodwill balance in its entirety relates to our IMES reporting unit that is included in the Healthcare segment.
355948_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
355948_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test as defined in ASU 2011-08.
355948_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	As amended, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one-step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
355948_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
355948_18_ITEM7_P83_S4	An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
355948_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	ASU 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
355948_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 for our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test.
355948_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
355948_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
355948_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	After reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in ASU 2011-08, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value for the IMES reporting unit was less than its carrying value.
355948_18_ITEM7_P85_S3	Accordingly, we performed the quantitative impairment test using the income method, which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates and the cost of capital.
355948_18_ITEM7_P85_S4	The Company used a weighted average cost of capital of 19% for these cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM7_P85_S5	The Guideline Public Company Method was also included in the goodwill impairment study.
355948_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The Company engaged a third party to assist with the goodwill impairment testing.
355948_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Management concluded that the results of our goodwill impairment test as of March 4, 2018 indicated that the value of goodwill attributed to our IMES reporting unit was not impaired due to its fair value exceeded its carrying value.
355948_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	In the three years since the acquisition, the Company has made significant investments in the IMES business, including capital expenditures and inventory, that are expected to increase IMES product offerings and result in increased future sales, operating profits and cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values were based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	As of the first day of our fourth quarter, we determined that our IMES reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value of at least 8.0%.
355948_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	Factors considered were the historical performance of the reporting unit, forecasted financials for the following ten years and comparable publically held companies.
355948_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	Management s projections used to estimate cash flows included increasing sales volumes from new product offerings, expanded sales into new geographies, and operational improvements designed to reduce costs.
355948_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	While all product lines are expected to grow, new product offerings are the largest component of the sales growth with more than 50% of future sales projected to be from new product offerings.
355948_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Changes in any of the significant assumptions used, including if the Company does not successfully achieve its operating plan, which is largely dependent on sales from new product offerings, can materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could result in a material non-cash impairment charge of goodwill and other long lived assets.
355948_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Potential events or changes in circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect key assumptions are deterioration in general market conditions or the environment in which the reporting unit or entity operates, an increased competitive environment in which the reporting unit or entity operates or other relevant entity-specific events such as market acceptance of our new CT tubes and other new product offerings, approvals to sell in foreign markets, and changes in management or key personnel.
355948_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
355948_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and technology acquired in connection with the acquisition.
355948_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	We review property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	If adverse events do occur, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities.
355948_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates.
355948_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and review business plans for possible impairment.
355948_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group.
355948_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value.
355948_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Additionally, we also evaluate the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization.
355948_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	If the estimate of a long lived asset s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.
355948_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_18_ITEM7_P97_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_18_ITEM7_P99_S4	See Note 9 Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
355948_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
355948_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S4	Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S5	Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S6	During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S7	We have undertaken a detailed analysis of our various contracts with customers and revenue streams, including engaging a third party to assist management in evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S8	The Company s management has elected to adopt the amendments in ASU 2014-09 on a modified retrospective basis; whereas any cumulative effect of adopting this guidance will be recognized as an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S9	Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S10	The Company does not expect the implementation of ASU 2014-09 and the related amendments to have a material impact on the timing, amount or characterization of revenue recognized by the Company.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S11	For most of our revenue, we will continue to recognize revenue when title to the goods transfers to the customer, as this is generally when control transfers to the customer.
355948_18_ITEM7_P101_S12	While we expect the impact of these new standards will be immaterial to our financial statements, upon adoption, we will include the expanded disclosures required by the new standards.
355948_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Pursuant to the Company s adoption of the standard it anticipates expanding its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for revenue recognition, assets and liabilities relating to contracts with customers, the nature of the Company s performance obligations and the manner by which the Company determines and allocates transaction prices and variable consideration to its performance obligations and the significant judgments inherent in its revenue recognition policies.
355948_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 ( ASU 2015-11 ), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
355948_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	ASU 2015-11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g., first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value.
355948_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
355948_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory.
355948_18_ITEM7_P103_S4	However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice.
355948_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	The Company adopted ASU 2015-11 in fiscal 2018 and there was no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases.
355948_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
355948_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
355948_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
355948_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
355948_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	Upon adoption, the Company expects that the amounts recognized for the ROU asset and lease liability in the balance sheets may be material.
355948_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , a new accounting standard update intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	Specifically, the ASU 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes) be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), introducing a new element of volatility to the provision for income taxes.
355948_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on May 28, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P108_S4	Effective with the adoption of the ASU all share-based awards continue to be accounted for as equity awards, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows on a prospective basis and the Company has elected to continue to estimate expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period.
355948_18_ITEM7_P108_S5	The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had no impact on the retained earnings, other components of equity or net assets as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
355948_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
355948_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	ASU 2016-13 introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
355948_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
355948_18_ITEM7_P109_S3	This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses.
355948_18_ITEM7_P109_S4	For public business entities, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and the guidance is to be applied using the modified-retrospective approach.
355948_18_ITEM7_P109_S5	Earlier adoption is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P109_S6	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ), Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
355948_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.
355948_18_ITEM7_P110_S4	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
355948_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
355948_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	As amended, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one-step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
355948_18_ITEM7_P111_S3	An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
355948_18_ITEM7_P111_S4	An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
355948_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	ASU 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
355948_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 for our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test.
355948_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
355948_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	The guidance permits entities to reclassify tax effects stranded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as a result of tax reform to retained earnings.
355948_18_ITEM7_P113_S2	This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Early adoption is permitted in annual and interim periods and can be applied retrospectively or in the period of adoption.
355948_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	In May 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, regarding the accounting implications of the recently issued Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ).
355948_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	The update clarifies that in a company s financial statements that include the reporting period in which the Act was enacted, the company must first reflect the income tax effects of the Act in which the accounting under GAAP is complete.
355948_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	These amounts would not be provisional amounts.
355948_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	The company would also report provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects for which the accounting under GAAP is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined.
355948_18_ITEM7_P116_S2	The Company has recorded a provisional amount which it believes is a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Act on the Company s financial statements as of June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM7_P116_S3	Technical corrections or other forthcoming guidance could change how the Company interprets provisions of the Act, which may impact its effective tax rate and could affect its deferred tax assets, tax positions and/or its tax liabilities.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements, denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency, are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in certain sales contracts and we also have local debt to offset asset exposures.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We have not used any derivative instruments nor entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $10.4 million during fiscal 2018, an estimated $9.1 million during fiscal 2017 and an estimated $9.9 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Total assets would have declined by an estimated $5.6 million as of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2018 and an estimated $5.2 million as of the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $1.0 million as of the fiscal year ended June 2, 2018 and an estimated $0.9 million as of the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors.
355948_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations.

355948_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	The amount owed to this supplier was approximately $1.9 million as of June 2, 2018 and $2.3 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for all fiscal years presented.
355948_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries.
355948_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
355948_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Our fiscal year 2018 began on May 28, 2017 and ended on June 2, 2018, our fiscal year 2017 began on May 29, 2016 and ended on May 27, 2017 and our fiscal year 2016 began on May 31, 2015 and ended on May 28, 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
355948_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
355948_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss contingencies and income taxes.
355948_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
355948_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The fair values of financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and market interest rates as of the end of the reporting period.
355948_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Our financial instruments include investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
355948_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	The fair values of these financial instruments approximate carrying values at June 2, 2018 and May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
355948_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.
355948_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables.
355948_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; and collectability and delinquency history by geographic area.
355948_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.
355948_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.3 million as of June 2, 2018 and $0.4 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
355948_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued.
355948_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
355948_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.
355948_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment, when title passes to the customer, when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and when collectability is reasonably assured.
355948_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	We also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience.
355948_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	Our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications.
355948_18_ITEM8_P23_S3	Our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs.
355948_18_ITEM8_P23_S4	Our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell.
355948_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	The functional currency is the local currency at all foreign locations, with the exception of Hong Kong, which the functional currency is the US dollar.
355948_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheets, are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period spot rates.
355948_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of stockholders equity.
355948_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the current rate on the date of the transaction.
355948_18_ITEM8_P25_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.
355948_18_ITEM8_P25_S4	Foreign exchange losses reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) were a loss of $0.2 million during fiscal 2018, a loss of $0.6 million during fiscal 2017 and a loss of $0.2 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.
355948_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Inventories, net: Our consolidated inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, generally using a weighted-average cost method.
355948_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	Our net inventories include approximately $42.6 million of finished goods, $5.7 million of raw materials and $2.4 million of work-in-progress as of June 2, 2018 as compared to approximately $36.0 million of finished goods, $5.3 million of raw materials and $1.4 million of work-in-progress as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	The inventory reserve as of June 2, 2018 was $4.0 million compared to $3.5 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
355948_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	If future demand changes in the industry or market conditions differ from management s estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.
355948_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in cost of sales.
355948_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	The provisions were primarily for obsolete and slow moving parts.
355948_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.
355948_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
355948_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence.
355948_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
355948_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.
355948_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Investments: As of June 2, 2018, we had no investments.
355948_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	As of May 27, 2017, we have invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit ( CD ) in the amount of $8.2 million.
355948_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	Of this, $6.4 million mature in less than twelve months and $1.8 million mature in greater than twelve months.
355948_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	We liquidated our investments in equity securities in fiscal 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Proceeds from the liquidation were $0.9 million with gross realized gains of $0.2 million for fiscal 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Prior to the liquidation of our investment in equity securities, our investments in equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and were carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices.
355948_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	Our investments, which were included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.6 million at May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.3 million during fiscal 2017 and $0.3 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Prior to liquidation of the equity securities, we reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method.
355948_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Gross realized gains and losses on those sales were less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	Net unrealized holding gain (loss) during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were less than $0.1 million and have been included in accumulated comprehensive loss during its respective fiscal year.
355948_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Discontinued Operations: On September 12, 2017, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois of approximately $2.0 million, which included interest earned.
355948_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	The refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division ( RFPD ) in 2011.
355948_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	A net benefit of $1.5 million, which included $0.5 million of professional fee costs incurred to pursue the refund, was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in discontinued operations.
355948_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	During fiscal 2017, the Company disposed of, by sale, the PACS Display business in the Healthcare segment.
355948_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Based on our assessment of the criteria that must be met to qualify a disposal transaction as a discontinued operation set forth in Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, the disposal of the PACS Display business does not qualify as a discontinued operation.
355948_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
355948_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
355948_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	As amended, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one-step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
355948_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
355948_18_ITEM8_P38_S4	An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
355948_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	ASU 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
355948_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 for our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test.
355948_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
355948_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
355948_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	We estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach and discounted cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	After reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in FASB ASC 350-20-35, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value for the IMES reporting unit was less than its carrying value.
355948_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accordingly, the quantitative goodwill impairment test as described in FASB ASC 350-20-35 was performed.
355948_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	We performed the quantitative impairment test using the income method, which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates and the cost of capital.
355948_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
355948_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
355948_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and technology acquired in connection with the acquisition.
355948_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
355948_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
355948_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Provisions for depreciation are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
355948_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Depreciation expense was approximately $2.6 million, $2.4 million and $2.0 million during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Property, plant and equipment consist of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Construction in progress at June 2, 2018 includes $0.7 million related to our Healthcare growth initiatives.
355948_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	All projects are expected to be completed before the end of fiscal 2019.
355948_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Supplemental disclosure information of the estimated useful life of the assets:
355948_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	We review all property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur which indicate a possible impairment may exist.
355948_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	We have concluded that our property, plant and equipment as of June 2, 2018 were not impaired.

355948_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years.
355948_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale.
355948_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
355948_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation.
355948_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products, the extended warranty period and warranty experience.
355948_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty.

355948_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We measure and recognize share-based compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options.
355948_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and dividends.
355948_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Compensation cost is recognized using a graded-vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period.
355948_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	Share-based compensation expense totaled approximately $0.5 million during fiscal 2018, $0.4 million during fiscal 2017 and $0.5 million during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Stock options granted generally vest over a period of five years and have contractual terms to exercise of 10 years.
355948_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows ( in thousands, except option prices and years) :
355948_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	There were 16,000 stock options exercised during fiscal 2018, with cash received of $0.1 million.
355948_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised totaled less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	The weighted average fair value of stock option grants was $0.85 during fiscal 2018, $1.14 during fiscal 2017 and $1.21 during fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	As of June 2, 2018, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options was approximately $0.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of approximately three to four years.

355948_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
355948_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience commensurate with the expected term.
355948_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option.
355948_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	The expected stock option life assumption is based on the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ).
355948_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	For stock options granted during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we believe that our historical stock option experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
355948_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	We utilized the Safe Harbor option, or Simplified Method, to determine the expected term of these options in accordance with SAB No. 107 for options granted.
355948_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	We intend to continue to utilize the Simplified Method for future grants in accordance with SAB No. 110 until such time that we believe that our historical stock option experience will provide a reasonable basis to estimate an expected term.
355948_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at June 2, 2018 ( in thousands, except option prices and years ):
355948_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	As of June 2, 2018, a summary of restricted stock award transactions was as follows (in thousands):
355948_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Compensation effects arising from issuing stock awards have been charged against income and recorded as additional paid-in-capital in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Employees 2011 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares as incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options or stock awards.
355948_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	Under this plan, 524,000 shares are reserved for future issuance.
355948_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	The Plan authorizes the granting of stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant.
355948_18_ITEM8_P70_S3	Generally, these options become exercisable over five years and expire up to 10 years from the date of grant.
355948_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	Earnings per Share: We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock, and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock.
355948_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time.
355948_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	In accordance with ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ), our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
355948_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.
355948_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method as prescribed in ASC 260.
355948_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.
355948_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	The earnings per share ( EPS ) presented in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) are based on the following ( in thousands, except per share amounts ):

355948_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
355948_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S4	Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S5	Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S6	During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S7	We have undertaken a detailed analysis of our various contracts with customers and revenue streams, including engaging a third party to assist management in evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S8	The Company s management has elected to adopt the amendments in ASU 2014-09 on a modified retrospective basis; whereas any cumulative effect of adopting this guidance will be recognized as an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S9	Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S10	The Company does not expect the implementation of ASU 2014-09 and the related amendments to have a material impact on the timing, amount or characterization of revenue recognized by the Company.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S11	For most of our revenue, we will continue to recognize revenue when title to the goods transfers to the customer, as this is generally when control transfers to the customer.
355948_18_ITEM8_P77_S12	While we expect the impact of these new standards will be immaterial to our financial statements, upon adoption, we will include the expanded disclosures required by the new standards.
355948_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Pursuant to the Company s adoption of the standard it anticipates expanding its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for revenue recognition, assets and liabilities relating to contracts with customers, the nature of the Company s performance obligations and the manner by which the Company determines and allocates transaction prices and variable consideration to its performance obligations and the significant judgments inherent in its revenue recognition policies.
355948_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 ( ASU 2015-11 ), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
355948_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	ASU 2015-11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g., first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value.
355948_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market.
355948_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory.
355948_18_ITEM8_P79_S4	However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice.
355948_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company adopted ASU 2015-11 in fiscal 2018 and there was no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases.
355948_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
355948_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
355948_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
355948_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
355948_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	Upon adoption, the Company expects that the amounts recognized for the ROU asset and lease liability in the balance sheets may be material.
355948_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , a new accounting standard update intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	Specifically, the ASU 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes) be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), introducing a new element of volatility to the provision for income taxes.
355948_18_ITEM8_P84_S2	This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
355948_18_ITEM8_P84_S3	The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on May 28, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P84_S4	Effective with the adoption of the ASU all share-based awards continue to be accounted for as equity awards, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows on a prospective basis and the Company has elected to continue to estimate expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period.
355948_18_ITEM8_P84_S5	The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had no impact on the retained earnings, other components of equity or net assets as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
355948_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
355948_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	ASU 2016-13 introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
355948_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
355948_18_ITEM8_P85_S3	This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses.
355948_18_ITEM8_P85_S4	For public business entities, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and the guidance is to be applied using the modified-retrospective approach.
355948_18_ITEM8_P85_S5	Earlier adoption is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P85_S6	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ), Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.

355948_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P86_S3	The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.
355948_18_ITEM8_P86_S4	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
355948_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	The guidance permits entities to reclassify tax effects stranded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as a result of tax reform to retained earnings.
355948_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Early adoption is permitted in annual and interim periods and can be applied retrospectively or in the period of adoption.
355948_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	In May 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, regarding the accounting implications of the recently issued Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ).
355948_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	The update clarifies that in a company s financial statements that include the reporting period in which the Act was enacted, the company must first reflect the income tax effects of the Act in which the accounting under GAAP is complete.
355948_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	These amounts would not be provisional amounts.
355948_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	The company would also report provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects for which the accounting under GAAP is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined.
355948_18_ITEM8_P90_S2	The Company has recorded a provisional amount which it believes is a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Act on the Company s financial statements as of June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P90_S3	Technical corrections or other forthcoming guidance could change how the Company interprets provisions of the Act, which may impact its effective tax rate and could affect its deferred tax assets, tax positions and/or its tax liabilities.

355948_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	The goodwill balance in its entirety relates to our IMES reporting unit that is included in the Healthcare segment.
355948_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit.
355948_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
355948_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test as defined in ASU 2011-08.
355948_18_ITEM8_P105_S2	As amended, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one-step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
355948_18_ITEM8_P105_S3	An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
355948_18_ITEM8_P105_S4	An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
355948_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	ASU 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
355948_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 for our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test.
355948_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	On March 4, 2018, our goodwill balance was reviewed for impairment on a qualitative basis.
355948_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	We determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our IMES reporting unit was less than its carrying amount after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances as provided in FASB ASC 350-20-35.
355948_18_ITEM8_P107_S2	Accordingly, the quantitative goodwill impairment test as described in FASB ASC 350-20-35 was performed.
355948_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	We performed the quantitative impairment test using the income method, which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates and the cost of capital.
355948_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	The Guideline Public Company Method was also included in the goodwill impairment study.
355948_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Company engaged a third party to assist with the goodwill impairment testing.
355948_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Management concluded that the results of our goodwill impairment test as of March 4, 2018 indicated that the value of goodwill attributed to our IMES reporting unit was not impaired due to its fair value exceeded its carrying value.
355948_18_ITEM8_P109_S2	In the three years since the acquisition, the Company has made significant investments in the IMES business, including capital expenditures, new product development and inventory, that are expected to increase IMES product offerings and result in increased future sales, operating profits and cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values were based on reasonable assumptions, historically, projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved.
355948_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	As of the first day of our fourth quarter, we determined that our IMES reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value of at least 8.0%.
355948_18_ITEM8_P110_S2	Factors considered in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit were the historical performance of the reporting unit, forecasted financials for the following ten years and comparable publically held companies.
355948_18_ITEM8_P110_S3	Management s projections used to estimate cash flows included increasing sales volumes from new product offerings, expanded sales into new geographies, and operational improvements designed to reduce costs.
355948_18_ITEM8_P110_S4	While all product lines are expected to grow, new product offerings are the largest component of the sales growth with more than 50% of future sales projected to be from new product offerings.
355948_18_ITEM8_P110_S5	The Company used a weighted average cost of capital of 19% for these cash flows.
355948_18_ITEM8_P110_S6	Changes in any of the significant assumptions used, including if the Company does not successfully achieve its operating plan, which is largely dependent on sales from new product offerings, can materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could result in a material non-cash impairment charge of goodwill and potentially other long lived assets.
355948_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	Potential events or changes in circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect key assumptions are deterioration in general market conditions or the environment in which the reporting unit or entity operates, an increased competitive environment in which the reporting unit or entity operates or other relevant entity-specific events such as market acceptance of our new CT tubes and other new product offerings, approvals to sell in foreign markets, and changes in management or key personnel.
355948_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
355948_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
355948_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and technology acquired in connection with our acquisitions.
355948_18_ITEM8_P113_S1	Intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows (in thousands) :
355948_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	Change from prior periods reflect impact of foreign currency translation.
355948_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	We determined that intangible assets were not impaired as of June 2, 2018 on the basis that no adverse events or changes in circumstances were identified that could indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
355948_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	The amortization expense associated with the intangible assets subject to amortization for the next five years is presented in the following table (in thousands) :
355948_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	The amortization expense associated with the intangible assets totaled approximately $0.4 million during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.
355948_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	The weighted average number of years of amortization expense remaining is 15.1 years.
355948_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	We lease certain warehouse and office facilities and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.
355948_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	Rent expense for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1.8 million, $1.9 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	Our future lease commitments for minimum rentals, including common area maintenance charges and property taxes during the next five years are as follows (in thousands) :
355948_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included the following components ( in thousands ):
355948_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following ( in thousands ):
355948_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	The differences between income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 29.2% for fiscal 2018 and 34% for fiscal 2017 and 2016 and the reported income tax provision for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:
355948_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
355948_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect continuing operations as of June 2, 2018 and May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Significant components were as follows (in thousands):
355948_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted new tax legislation, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ).
355948_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	The primary provisions of the Act expected to impact the Company in fiscal 2018 are a reduction to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a transition from a worldwide corporate tax system to a territorial tax system.
355948_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	The reduction in the corporate income tax rate requires the Company to remeasure its net deferred tax assets to the new corporate tax rate and the transition to a territorial tax system requires payment of a one-time tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed and previously untaxed non-U.S. earnings.
355948_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	Primarily as a result of those provisions of the Act, the Company recorded a deferred remeasurement impact of approximately $1.6 million, which was fully offset by the valuation allowance movement.
355948_18_ITEM8_P124_S4	Additionally, the estimated deemed earnings repatriation tax, net of available foreign tax credits brought back as part of the deemed repatriation, was $3.5 million.
355948_18_ITEM8_P124_S5	The Company does not anticipate any cash tax payments due to the foreign tax credit carryforwards available to fully offset the provisional deemed repatriation tax.
355948_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	The 21% corporate income tax rate was effective January 1, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	Based on the Company s June 2, 2018 fiscal year end, the U.S. statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 29.2%.
355948_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	The tax impact recorded for the Act for fiscal 2018 is provisional as outlined below and may change.
355948_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Company completed a preliminary assessment of earnings that could be repatriated based on reinvestment needs of non-U.S. operations and earnings available for repatriation.
355948_18_ITEM8_P127_S1	The estimated withholding tax that would be incurred from the repatriation of those earnings was included in fiscal 2018 provisional income tax expense.
355948_18_ITEM8_P127_S2	The Company continues to analyze the provisions of the Act addressing the net deferred tax asset remeasurement and its calculations, the deemed earnings repatriation, including the determination of undistributed non-U.S. earnings, and evaluate potential Company actions.
355948_18_ITEM8_P127_S3	In addition, the Company continues to monitor potential legislative action and regulatory interpretations of the Act.
355948_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Based on the effective date of certain provisions, the Company will be subject to additional requirements of the Act beginning in fiscal 2019.
355948_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	Those provisions include a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), a tax determined by base erosion and anti-avoidance tax (BEAT) related to certain payments between a U.S. corporation and foreign related entities, a limitation of certain executive compensation, a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII) and interest expense limitations.
355948_18_ITEM8_P128_S2	The Company has not completed its analysis of those provisions and the estimated impact.
355948_18_ITEM8_P128_S3	The Company also has not determined its accounting policy to treat the taxes due on GILTI as a period cost or include in the determination of deferred taxes.
355948_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 that allows for a measurement period up to one year after the enactment date of the Act to complete the accounting requirements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P129_S1	The Company will complete the adjustments related to the Act within the allowed period.
355948_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	As of June 2, 2018, we had approximately $3.4 million of net deferred tax assets related to federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards, compared to $4.2 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P130_S1	Net deferred tax assets related to domestic state NOL carryforwards amounted to approximately $3.9 million as of June 2, 2018, compared to $3.0 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P130_S2	Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards as of June 2, 2018 totaled approximately $0.6 million with various or indefinite expiration dates.
355948_18_ITEM8_P130_S3	The amount of net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was $0.7 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P130_S4	We also have a domestic net deferred tax asset of $0.5 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of June 2, 2018, compared to $3.8 million as of May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P130_S5	The changes in balances from prior year are generally due to the transition tax that was part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for which the deemed inclusion on foreign earnings utilized most of the foreign tax credit carryforwards available.
355948_18_ITEM8_P130_S6	We do not have any alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as of June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	We have historically determined that undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S.
355948_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	We repatriated $21.2 million of foreign cash to our U.S. parent company in fiscal 2018, $17.7 million from our Hong Kong entity and the remainder from our entities in Singapore, Italy and Taiwan.
355948_18_ITEM8_P131_S2	Due to the deemed repatriation tax, the untaxed outside basis difference for which the historic balance has primarily related has been reduced.
355948_18_ITEM8_P131_S3	The deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference is now primarily withholding tax on future dividend distributions.
355948_18_ITEM8_P131_S4	Accordingly, we have reduced the deferred tax liability from $5.7 million in fiscal 2017 to be $0.3 million in fiscal 2018 on foreign earnings of $28.6 million.
355948_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
355948_18_ITEM8_P132_S1	A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM8_P132_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider subjective evidence such as future income projections.
355948_18_ITEM8_P132_S3	We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the repatriation of foreign earnings which we do not consider permanently reinvested in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
355948_18_ITEM8_P132_S4	The weight of this positive evidence is not sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
355948_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	As of June 2, 2018, a valuation allowance of $9.1 million has been established to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that will more likely than not be realized.
355948_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	There has been an increase in the valuation allowance from May 27, 2017 in the amount of $0.6 million.
355948_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred.
355948_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	We also recorded a valuation allowance for all domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets considering the significant cumulative losses in the U.S. jurisdiction, the reversal of the deferred tax liability for foreign earnings and no forecast of additional U.S. income.
355948_18_ITEM8_P134_S2	The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
355948_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	Income taxes paid, including foreign estimated tax payments, were $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million, during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.
355948_18_ITEM8_P136_S1	Generally, years prior to fiscal 2010 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
355948_18_ITEM8_P136_S2	We are currently under examination in Thailand (fiscal 2008 through 2011).
355948_18_ITEM8_P136_S3	We are also under examination in the state of Illinois for fiscal years 2014 and 2015.
355948_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands.
355948_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2015 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2012.
355948_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	The uncertain tax positions from continuing operations as of June 2, 2018 and May 27, 2017 were $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	We record penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
355948_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.
355948_18_ITEM8_P139_S2	We have not recorded a liability for interest and penalties as of June 2, 2018 or May 27, 2017.
355948_18_ITEM8_P139_S3	It is not expected that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next 12 months.
355948_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	The following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands ):
355948_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits for continuing and discontinued operations were as follows (in thousands) :

355948_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	Employee Profit Sharing Plan: The employee profit sharing plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan for employees.
355948_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	The profit sharing plan has a 401(k) provision whereby we match 50% of employee contributions up to 4.0% of pay.
355948_18_ITEM8_P143_S2	Charges to expense for matching contributions to this plan were $0.4 million, $0.0 million and $0.4 million, during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
355948_18_ITEM8_P143_S3	The Company suspended the match component for fiscal 2017.

No. 2017-0868-AGB.
355948_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the Company s directors and challenges the decision of a special committee of the Company s Board to refuse Mr. Busch s demand that the Company s Board, among other things, rescind the Company s May 2013 repurchase of stock from Mr. Richardson and May 2013 and October 2014 repurchases of Company stock from the Richardson Wildlife Foundation.

355948_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
355948_18_ITEM8_P166_S1	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

355948_18_ITEM8_P174_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries at June 2, 2018 and May 27, 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 2, 2018 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

355948_18_ITEM8_P176_S0	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
355948_18_ITEM8_P176_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

355948_18_ITEM8_P177_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
355948_18_ITEM8_P177_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
355948_18_ITEM8_P178_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
355948_18_ITEM8_P178_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P178_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

355948_18_ITEM8_P180_S0	We have audited Richardson Electronics, Ltd. s (the Company s ) internal control over financial reporting as of June 2, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria ).
355948_18_ITEM8_P180_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 2, 2018, based on the COSO criteria .

355948_18_ITEM8_P182_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
355948_18_ITEM8_P182_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
355948_18_ITEM8_P183_S0	We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
355948_18_ITEM8_P183_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
355948_18_ITEM8_P183_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
355948_18_ITEM8_P183_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
355948_18_ITEM8_P183_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
355948_18_ITEM8_P184_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
355948_18_ITEM8_P184_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P185_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_18_ITEM8_P185_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
355948_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
355948_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
355948_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
355948_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
355948_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 2, 2018, based on the framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
355948_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 2, 2018.

355948_18_ITEM15_P227_S0	LaFox, IL, July 25, 2018: Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (NASDAQ: RELL) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 2, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM15_P227_S1	The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.06 per share quarterly cash dividend.
355948_18_ITEM15_P228_S0	Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 21.8% to $45.5 million compared to net sales of $37.4 million in the prior year s fourth quarter.
355948_18_ITEM15_P228_S1	Sales increased $8.4 million for PMT and $1.0 million for Canvys.
355948_18_ITEM15_P228_S2	PMT sales were higher in power conversion and RF and microwave components, industrial power grid tubes and specialty products sold into the semiconductor wafer fabrication capital equipment market.
355948_18_ITEM15_P228_S3	Sales increased for Canvys due to new program wins and higher overall demand across both the U.S. and Europe.
355948_18_ITEM15_P228_S4	Sales decreased for Richardson Healthcare by $1.3 million due to the sale of the PACS Display business at the end of fiscal 2017 and lower sales of pre-owned CT Tubes.
355948_18_ITEM15_P228_S5	However, at the end of the quarter, the Healthcare group released its first CT Tube, making Richardson Electronics one of a small group of global companies with the design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to successfully produce CT Tubes.
355948_18_ITEM15_P228_S6	This capability is the cornerstone for expanding the Company s presence in the healthcare market.
355948_18_ITEM15_P229_S0	Gross margin increased to $15.5 million, or 34.1% of net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $12.0 million, or 32.1% of net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P229_S1	Margin increased as a percent of net sales primarily due to an improved product mix in both PMT and Canvys.
355948_18_ITEM15_P229_S2	Richardson Healthcare margin as a percent of net sales also increased primarily due to the sale of its lower margin PACS Display business.
355948_18_ITEM15_P230_S0	Operating expenses increased to $13.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $12.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P230_S1	This increase was a result of additional compensation and other expenses primarily related to the increase in net sales as well as higher research and development and other expenses for Richardson Healthcare.
355948_18_ITEM15_P230_S2	Operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 30.1% in the current quarter from 32.5% last year.
355948_18_ITEM15_P231_S0	Including a small gain on disposal of assets, the Company reported $1.9 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to operating income of $39,000 in the prior year s fourth quarter.
355948_18_ITEM15_P232_S0	Other income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily foreign exchange, was $0.3 million, compared to other expense of $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P233_S0	The income tax provision of $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected a provision for foreign income taxes based on the current quarter s geographical distribution of income and adjustments from foreign income tax returns recently filed.
355948_18_ITEM15_P234_S0	Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.7 million, compared to a net loss of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P235_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2018 were $163.2 million, an increase of 19.2%, compared to net sales of $136.9 million for fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P235_S1	Sales increased by $24.1 million for PMT and $6.1 million for Canvys.
355948_18_ITEM15_P235_S2	These increases were partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease for Richardson Healthcare, which was due to the divestiture of the PACS Display business at the end of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P236_S0	Gross profit increased to $55.1 million, compared to $43.9 million for fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P236_S1	As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 33.7% of net sales during fiscal 2018, compared to 32.1% of net sales of fiscal 2017, mostly a result of an improved product mix.
355948_18_ITEM15_P237_S0	Operating expenses increased to $51.7 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $49.9 million for fiscal 2017, which included $1.3 million in severance expense associated with the reduction in work force during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P237_S1	The increase was due to additional compensation and other expenses mostly related to the higher net sales in PMT and Canvys as well as increased research and development and other expenses for Richardson Healthcare.
355948_18_ITEM15_P238_S0	In addition, during fiscal 2018, we recorded a $0.3 million total gain on the sale of our building in Florence, Italy and the disposal of old assets in LaFox.
355948_18_ITEM15_P238_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2018 was $3.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.8 million for fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P239_S0	Other income for fiscal 2018, including foreign exchange and investment income, was $0.2 million, compared to other expense of $0.4 million for fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P240_S0	The income tax provision of $1.5 million during fiscal 2018 reflected a provision for foreign income taxes, additional tax due from an audit in Germany and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss.
355948_18_ITEM15_P240_S1	During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company calculated its estimated tax liability as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act.
355948_18_ITEM15_P240_S2	The $11.2 million liability was entirely offset by newly generated foreign tax credits and foreign tax credit carryforwards.
355948_18_ITEM15_P240_S3	In addition, the company wrote down $1.6 million of its net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets against the valuation allowance due to the reduction in the federal tax rate.
355948_18_ITEM15_P241_S0	Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 was $2.3 million, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $6.9 million in 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P241_S1	In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois, inclusive of interest and net of professional fees, of $1.5 million.
355948_18_ITEM15_P241_S2	This refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of RFPD in 2011 and was therefore, classified as income from discontinued operations.
355948_18_ITEM15_P242_S0	Net income for fiscal 2018 was $3.8 million, compared to a net loss of $6.9 million for fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P243_S0	The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a $0.06 quarterly dividend per share to holders of common stock and a $0.054 cash dividend per share to holders of Class B common stock.
355948_18_ITEM15_P243_S1	The dividend will be payable on August 23, 2018, to common stockholders of record on August 7, 2018.
355948_18_ITEM15_P244_S0	Cash and investments at the end of fiscal 2018 were $60.5 million compared to $60.1 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and $64.2 million at the end of fiscal 2017.
355948_18_ITEM15_P244_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under the existing share repurchase authorization.
355948_18_ITEM15_P244_S2	Since the sale of RFPD, the Company has spent $65.6 million on share repurchases, nearly $20.0 million on acquisitions, approximately $23.3 million on dividends and $9.2 million on purchases of Richardson Healthcare equipment.
355948_18_ITEM15_P244_S3	Currently, there are 10.8 million outstanding shares of common stock and 2.1 million outstanding shares of Class B common stock.

355948_18_ITEM15_P245_S1	Consolidated net sales grew by nearly 22% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 along with a significant improvement in gross margin, which was driven by a favorable global economy and the success of our growth initiatives.
355948_18_ITEM15_P246_S0	All three of our strategic business units did well in fiscal 2018.
355948_18_ITEM15_P246_S1	We are particularly excited about the recent introduction of our new ALTA750 TM CT Tube and plan to aggressively market it worldwide, Mr. Richardson concluded.
