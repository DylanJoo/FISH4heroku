1172706_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Invisa, Inc. is a Nevada corporation that manufactures and sells a line of SmartGate brand safety sensors used in or with parking gates to protect life and property.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Parking gates are motorized barriers used to control the flow of vehicular traffic in areas such as parking facilities, vehicle storage facilities, tollbooths, and metered entry points for highways.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our SmartGate sensors are based on presence sensing technology that we call InvisaShield.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	While we believe that our InvisaShield technology may have additional applications for safety products, to date all of our revenue has been derived from the sale of SmartGate sensors used in parking gates.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	We acquired the InvisaShield presence-sensing technology in 2004.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Presence sensing is the repeatable detection of people and conductive objects within a certain perimeter of the sensor.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	InvisaShield technology detects objects at a distance of typically less than one meter.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	Invisa currently owns the patent and patent applications, as well as the sole rights to the InvisaShield technology in all markets worldwide.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our offices are located at 1800 2 nd Street, Suite 965, Sarasota, FL 34236, telephone (941) 870-3950.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Many products use presence-sensing technology; however, we believe that our InvisaShield technology is particularly suited to safety sensors for use in the parking gate market.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2009 and 2010, all of our revenues were derived from the sale of SmartGate safety sensors used with powered parking gates.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	These gates typically have a power-operated barrier arm made of metal, wood or PVC.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	This arm moves vertically between an open and a closed position.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	Our device places an invisible presence-sensing field around the potentially dangerous barrier arm to detect people and vehicles in its path.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P6_S5	Our device signals the powered gate to trigger a predetermined response, such as stopping and reversing the barrier arm.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P6_S6	The retail price for our SmartGate sensors allow us to realize an acceptable gross profit margin, however, we continue to look for ways to decrease our cost of goods and increase our distribution to improve our profit margins.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	We sell our safety products to manufacturers, dealers and end-users.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	As part of our current sales efforts, we have attended trade shows and have continued our relationships with our customer list which comprises manufacturers, dealers and end users.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	We also receive unsolicited orders either by telephone, fax or internet.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P7_S3	In addition, during fiscal year 2010, we have sought relationships with architectural engineering firms and municipalities that are implementing projects requiring parking barrier gates, such as municipal parking lots and airport reconstruction.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Although we do not maintain a full-time sales force, we do engage outside sales consultants.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 2010, Carolina Time Equipment Company was our largest customer comprising of 11% of our sales.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2009, Automatic Systems America was our largest customer, responsible for 11% of our product revenues.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	The sales to Automatic Systems in 2009 include a project that Automatic Systems is administering for a large governmental end user and no assurance can be given that we will continue to sell products to Automatic Systems at the same level once the project is complete.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	InvisaShield technology uses electronic circuitry that emits, controls, and monitors changes in an invisible energy field.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The field is based, in part, upon low energy radio waves oscillating within a controlled frequency range.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	The field that is monitored can be varied in sensitivity from a distance of approximately one meter to a centimeter or less, depending upon the selected application.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	Circuitry constantly checks the field to test for the presence of people, vehicles or other conductive objects (objects that conduct electricity) that would disturb the monitored field.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that the InvisaShield technology is a novel and proprietary way to provide presence sensing.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	At the core of the technology is the ability to project a field or zone capable of detecting most conductive objects that enter the field.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	The field is projected from a metallic substance, referred to as an antenna, which may consist of wire, self-adhesive metallic tape or other metallic items.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	The technology allows flexibility in designing and locating the antenna.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	This may offer unique opportunities to place presence-sensing fields where they can be used more efficiently or effectively.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	This adaptability may permit the InvisaShield technology to perform non-contact presence-sensing tasks not currently possible with competing technologies and/or it may perform presence-sensing tasks similar to those performed by competing technologies, but in a more efficient, effective, and reliable manner.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	InvisaShield technology does not depend upon lenses, beams or reflectors, which may require replacement, cleaning and aligning.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Its operating environment, including electronic noise, mechanical noise, temperature, dust, frost, snow, ice or other operating conditions, generally does not disrupt the non-intrusive, non-contact presence-sensing capability of our technology.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have, in the past, sought to develop additional products based on our InvisaShield technology.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We have developed pre-production prototypes of safety products for various power doors such as slide-gates, commercial overhead doors, powered industrial doors (which are used in commercial, manufacturing and industrial facilities) and residential garage doors and pre-production prototypes of security products various applications in museums, retail and industrial.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Competing Technologies - The presence-sensing business is highly competitive, consisting of numerous manufacturers of presence-sensing products based on various technologies, including infrared, ultrasonic, laser, microwave, and similar technologies.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	For the most part, these technologies have been in use for a number of years and, in many cases, may not be proprietary.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our competitors provide a variety of presence-sensing and other safety and security alternatives such as motion detectors, CCTV-based movement detection systems, infrared and visible light beam detectors, light curtains, on/off switching mats and pads, tape switches, contact edges, as well as others.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	In the safety and/or security sectors we compete with many companies, including MillerEdge, Stanley, Optex, Napco, Pelco, and DMP, along with other large and well-established firms such as Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, and Siemens.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater development, technical, marketing, sales and financial capabilities than we have.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result of these factors, competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and/or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	No. 7,187,282 issued on March 6, 2007.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	In addition, we have filed for two patents (as PCT, or Patent Cooperation Treaty filings), one provisional patent application and have one application pending, all of which cover improvements to the InvisaShield technology.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have a trademark on the trade name SmartGate which we use in our safety products category.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	We have filed trademark applications for the following: Invisa , InvisaShield and the tagline Safe.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that our patent and trademark position will be useful in our efforts to protect our perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	All components and parts are modified or manufactured to our specifications by third parties or are otherwise generally available as off-the-shelf materials.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our products have a number of components including proprietary electronic circuitry manufactured to our specifications by third party manufacturers and a standard power supply available in the marketplace.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The antenna is standard wire, tape or other metallic materials, which can generally be purchased in bulk.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Whenever possible, we use fixed price manufacturing for our electronic circuitry, placing the responsibility for component supply on the manufacturer.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	We believe that there are multiple manufacturers and suppliers for each component and that adequate components and materials will be available to support our business plan.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	We perform some final assembly and predetermined quality control procedures in our facility using contractors, including contract piece work in connection with the assembly when needed.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	All shipping is done directly from our facility.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Federal Communications Commission regulates the use of radio frequency or RF , such as that used by our safety products.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	We currently have FCC Certification for our product.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	We will endeavor to continue satisfying all requirements of the FCC to maintain our FCC Certification.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	On March 1, 2001, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) implemented a new safety standard for the powered gate, door and window industry.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	This rule, UL-325, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows, and is a requirement for UL certification for certain powered gate, door and window operators.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Gate and operator manufacturers that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification important for components most likely will require that our products be UL certified before incorporating our products as original equipment.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	We do not have a UL certification and the absence of UL certification for our products may represent a sales or marketing barrier in certain market categories and to certain customers.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our products have also earned the Conformit Europ enne marking (also known as CE mark) which is a mandatory conformity mark placed on many products used in the single market in the European Economic Area.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	The CE mark certifies that a product has met EU consumer safety, health or environmental requirements.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	This marking is mandatory for sales of products in approximately 27 European countries but is usually preferred by customers whether or not required in their respective countries.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	In addition to gaining the CE mark, our products are now RoHS compliant and have been since late 2008.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 2002/95/EC; commonly referred to as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive or RoHS) was adopted in February 2003 by the European Union and took effect in July 2006.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	This directive restricts the use of six hazardous materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ether), in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	By complying with the RoHS directive, our customers are assured that our products are free of these hazardous substances.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our safety products are sold with a 90-day limited warranty against manufactures parts and defects.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have had no significant claims expensed under the warranty in 2009 or 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We have no full time employees.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our Chief Financial Officer, who is currently our Acting President, serves in both capacities on a part-time consulting basis.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	We support our operations by using consultants and third party contract piece workers as required .
1172706_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	We are not conducting any research and development with respect to our technology at this time.
1172706_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Therefore, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 we incurred no research and development expenses.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common stock.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. .
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We have historically incurred losses and losses are expected to continue in the future, which means that we may not be able to continue operations unless we obtain additional funding.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	In the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we sustained a net loss from operations of $123,312, net of a gain of $127,415 to reflect the favorable settlement of certain debt.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Absent a dramatic increase in our market share or demand for our products, future losses are expected to continue.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Accordingly, we will experience significant liquidity and cash flow problems if we are not successful in increasing our sales and lowering costs.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	No assurances can be given that we will be successful in reaching or maintaining profitable operations.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability to manufacture and sell our products in sufficient volume to cover our fixed and variable costs of operations.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We will need to continue financing our operations through third party sources or we may be unable to fund our operations, promote our products or develop our technology.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In recent years, our operations have relied almost entirely on external financing to fund our operations; however, in 2010 sales revenues satisfied approximately 35% of our operational costs and expenses.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During 2009 and 2010, we funded our operations with funds borrowed under short-term and long-term notes which, for the most part, were secured with the Company s assets.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We anticipate, based on our current proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations, that the line of credit established by our senior lender will provide adequate funding to continue to operate our business through December 31, 2011.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Unless our sales increase significantly, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operating expenses beyond December 31, 2011.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We cannot assure you that financing, whether from external sources or related parties, will be available if needed or on favorable terms beyond December 31, 2011.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our secured debt, fund our operations and planned growth, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive market pressures, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our longterm business plan.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financing requirements could result in dilution to existing stockholders.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The additional financings we will require may be obtained through one or more transactions, which effectively dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Further, we may not be able to secure such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock, as well as additional classes or series of ownership interests or debt obligations that may be convertible into any one or more classes or series of ownership interests.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We are authorized to issue 95,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Such securities may be issued without the approval or other consent of our stockholders.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We anticipate that we will encounter difficulties and risks relating to our sales revenues, which include, but are not limited to, the introduction of new products, the ability to hire full time personnel, access to required capital, management issues, increasing our manufacturing capacity, and other similar aspects of operations which are important to our business operations.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We will be required to compete with larger, more established, and better financed companies.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There are a number of well-established companies that are well known in the manufacture and/or distribution of products for the security and life-safety markets.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Such companies include Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, Siemens and others.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to the difficult challenge of introducing and commercializing our new technology and products in a strong competitive environment.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Additionally, our technology and products based thereon will have to compete with other technologies such as passive infrared and various types of motion detection that are well known and well accepted.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We continue to experience uncertainty and risks related to market acceptance.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We continue our efforts to expand the market for our safety sensor product, to gain broader market acceptance and to demonstrate competitive advantages.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our success is dependent, to a large degree, upon our ability to successfully market our technology and its perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in connection with the operation of a small business in a highly competitive industry, characterized by frequent new product introductions.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We anticipate that we will continue to be disadvantaged by our limited revenues as they will inhibit our ability to expand our marketing and sales efforts in the domestic and international marketplace.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The limits of our of product liability insurance coverage may affect our Business.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may be exposed to potential product liability claims by consumers.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities to which we may be exposed.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Any product liability claim, even one that was not in excess of our insurance coverage or one that is meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition, the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Also, certain vendors may require minimum product liability insurance coverage as a condition precedent to purchasing or accepting products for retail distribution.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Product liability insurance coverage includes various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage, and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Failure to satisfy such insurance requirements could impede our ability or our distributors or licensees ability to achieve broad retail distribution of our proposed products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, the foundation of our business, which could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We regard certain aspects of our products, processes, services and technology as proprietary.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have taken steps to protect them with patents, copyrights, trademarks, restrictions on disclosure and other methods.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Despite these precautions, we cannot be certain that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights or that third parties will not independently develop similar products, services and technology.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any infringement, misappropriation or independent development could cause us to cease operations.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have issued patents and have filed patent applications with respect to various aspects of our technology.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The pending patent applications may not be issued to us, and if issued, may not protect our intellectual property from competition, which could seek to design around or invalidate these patents.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights in our products, services and technology could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend ourselves from claims of infringement, invalidity or unenforceability.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Litigation may be expensive and divert resources even if we win.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results such that it could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Other parties may assert that our technology infringes on their Intellectual property rights, which could divert management time and resources and possibly force our Company to redesign our technology.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Technology-based companies, such as ours, have the potential to be involved in litigation related to allegations of patent infringement.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although we have no knowledge of any such claims, from time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	While there currently are no outstanding infringement claims pending by or against us, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, that assertion by such parties will not result in costly litigation, or that they will not prevail in any such litigation.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or, alternatively, be able to redesign products on a cost-effective basis to avoid infringement.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any infringement claim or other litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on us and could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes, which could render our products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in technology, changes in customer requirements and preferences, introduction of products and services embodying new or different technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technology and products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and features of our technology and products.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We expect that our marketplace will require extensive technological upgrades and enhancements to accommodate many of the new products and services that we anticipate will be added to our marketplace.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand and upgrade our technology and systems, or successfully integrate new technologies or systems we develop in the future, to accommodate such increases in a timely manner.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may not be able to increase sales or if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth necessary to execute our business plan, which could adversely affect the quality of our operations and our costs.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In order to successfully execute our business plan, we must significantly increase our sales and revenue.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Additionally, we will need to increase the number of strategic partners, manufacturers, dealers, distributors and customers that use our products.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Lack of growth in sales and revenue will require that we continue to access financing which will subject us to the risks attendant thereto.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	On the other hand, if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, the resulting growth will place significant strain on our systems and resources.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In the event of growth, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, continue complying with all applicable regulations and expand our internal management, technical information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We cannot be sure that we will manage our growth effectively, and our failure to do so could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have no full time employees.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our Chief Financial Officer is also serving as our acting President and is available to the Company on a part time consulting basis.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We also engage consultants and contract piece workers as necessary.
1172706_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Unless additional employees are hired, the limited size of our staff could restrict the level and/or nature of our business operations.

1172706_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Interest (expense) and other, Net - The interest expense during 2009 of $62,202 and during 2010 of $71,631 relates primarily to financing costs and interest due to certain stockholders under lines of credit to the Company.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	During 2009 and 2010, the Company wrote off certain debts resulting in the extinguishment gain of $24,714 and $127,415, respectively.

1172706_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have extended the maturity of our short-term debt to March 31, 2012, and have in place a line of credit which we believe is sufficient to finance our operations through December 31, 2011.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	(See Note J to accompanying financial statements)-.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition, we will explore other business opportunities such as licensing and business combinations as they may arise.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had a cash and cash equivalents totaling $3,605.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company has four Lines of Credit with its Senior Lender totaling $500,000 under which $477,293 have been borrowed at December 31, 2010.

1172706_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	We believe that the line of credit facility and our sales revenue will be sufficient to finance our operations through December 31, 2011.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	However, we will continue to explore other avenues of financing, such as licensing of our product and/or our technology and potential strategic or business relationships or combinations, and to a lesser degree private equity and debt financing.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	While we are confident that the current funding and sales revenue available to us will be sufficient to finance our operations through December 31, 2011, it is important to note that additional funding, if needed, may not be available when required or it may not be available on acceptable terms.
1172706_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Should we require additional funding, we may need to reduce or refocus our operations or obtain funds through arrangements that would be less attractive to us or which may require us to relinquish rights to certain or potential markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

1172706_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	If neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable, companies shall use their best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method.

1172706_11_ITEM10_P19_S0	The Audit Committee reviewed with the independent auditors, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles, and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Committee in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1172706_11_ITEM10_P19_S1	In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors independence from management and the Company, including the matters in the written disclosures required by the Independence Standards Board and considered compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors independence .

1172706_11_ITEM10_P27_S0	We do not have a formal plan for compensating our directors.
1172706_11_ITEM10_P27_S1	Although there was no compensation in 2010, during the 2009 fiscal year each of our Directors were granted 25,000 shares of the Company s common stock.
1172706_11_ITEM10_P28_S0	Our bylaws provide for us to indemnify our directors and officers to the extent permitted by Nevada law, with respect to actions taken by them on our behalf.
1172706_11_ITEM10_P28_S1	We maintain a policy of directors and officers liability insurance for this purpose.
1172706_11_ITEM10_P29_S0	We have no interlocking director relationships.
1172706_11_ITEM10_P29_S1	None of our executive officers is a member of the Compensation Committee of any company in which any director or executive officer is a member of our board of directors.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P0_S0	This Compensation Discussion and Analysis is intended to describe the material factors underlying the compensation policies and decisions of the Company with regard to compensation paid to our executive officers in 2009 and 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	The Compensation Committee oversees the Company s executive compensation in accordance with its Charter and recommends to the Board of Directors compensation for the named executive officers.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P1_S1	The Compensation Committee receives input and recommendations when requested from our executive officers.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	Our only named executive officer at the end of fiscal 2010, Mr. Edmund King, does not have a written employment agreement and works on a part-time basis for the Company.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P2_S1	Mr. King received no salary or other cash compensation during fiscal 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P2_S2	However the Company charged $36,000 to operations for the value of his services.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	Our compensation philosophy for our executive officers has been shaped by our lack of long-term financing and our severe shortage of operating capital.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P3_S1	Accordingly, our compensation decisions and particularly our approach to allocating compensation between cash and non-cash elements of the compensation package reflect our goal to preserve cash whenever possible.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P3_S2	In fiscal 2007 our compensation decisions for our executive officers emphasized option grants which we believe support our goals with regard to both retention and motivation of our executive officers.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P3_S3	In making our compensation decisions, we strive to be aware of the level of compensation which is paid to executive officers of various companies that we consider to be comparable to us in size.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P3_S4	Our goal is for the compensation paid to our named executive officers to be at or below the fiftieth percentile of the companies that we have identified as being comparable companies.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P4_S0	Mr. King did not receive any base salary in fiscal 2009 or 2010; however, a proforma amount of $36,000 has been charged to operations and credited to additional paid in capital in each of these years.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P5_S0	N o Options were granted in fiscal years 2009 or 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P6_S0	Consistent with our philosophy to preserve cash, we have sought to limit perquisites.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P6_S1	Perquisites paid to our named executive officers are discussed as footnotes to the following Summary Compensation Table.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P7_S0	Our current policy for paying medical and dental insurance is not to pay insurance premiums.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P7_S1	Our policy is not to pay for life insurance, long-term and short-term disability insurances and accidental death and dismemberment insurance.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P7_S2	Our policy with regard to unused vacation for our executive group is to pay at the base salary rate for vacation not used during the calendar year of termination.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K and discussed it with the Company s management.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P8_S1	Based on the Compensation Committee s review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommends to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P9_S0	We have no written employment agreements .
1172706_11_ITEM11_P10_S0	We have five stock plans as listed below:
1172706_11_ITEM11_P11_S0	All of the Plans have been approved by the Board of Directors and all, except for the 2006 Plan, have been approved by the Shareholders.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P11_S1	All of the plans authorize awards of incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options to employees, directors, and consultants of our company and affiliates.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P11_S2	The purposes of the Plans are as follows: to encourage and enable employees, directors, and consultants to acquire a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of our company; to generate an increased incentive for key employees and directors to contribute to our future success and prosperity, thus enhancing the value of our company for the benefit of our stockholders; and to enhance the ability of our company to attract and retain key employees and directors who are essential to progress, growth, and profitability.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P12_S0	The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board (the Administrator ).
1172706_11_ITEM11_P12_S1	All members of our Compensation Committee are non-employee directors and outside directors, as defined in the Plans.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P13_S0	Subject to the limitations set forth in the Plans, the administrator has the authority to grant options, to determine the purchase price of the shares of our common stock covered by each option, to establish the term of each option, to determine the number of shares of our common stock to be covered by each option, to establish vesting schedules, to designate options as incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, and to determine the persons to whom grants are to be made.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P14_S0	The Administrator establishes the option exercise price, which in the case of incentive stock options, must be at least the market price (as such term is defined in the Plans) of our common stock on the date of the grant or, with respect to optionees who own at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock (a 10% Stockholder ), 110% of the market price on the date of the grant.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P15_S0	Options granted under the Plans are generally not transferable by the optionee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to written agreement approved by the administrator relating to any non-qualified stock options in any manner authorized under applicable law.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P16_S0	Except as provided in the applicable stock option agreement, options must be exercised within 90 days of termination for any reason other than disability, retirement, or death, within one year of termination by disability or retirement, or by a designated beneficiary within two years of death.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P17_S0	Except as provided to the contrary in the option agreement, options granted under the Plans vest in one-third annual increments, beginning on the grant date of the option.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P17_S1	In no event may an incentive stock option be granted more than 10 years from the effective date of the plan or be exercised after either the expiration of 10 years from the grant date, or five years from the grant date in the case of a 10% Stockholder.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P18_S0	Incentive stock options may not vest for the first time with the respect to any optionee in a calendar year with a market price exceeding $100,000.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P18_S1	Any option grants that exceed that amount shall be automatically treated as non-statutory stock options.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P19_S0	The Plans may be suspended, terminated, modified, or amended by our board, but no such suspension, termination, modification, or amendment may adversely affect the terms of any option previously granted without the consent of the affected optionee, and any amendment will be subject to stockholder approval to the extent required by applicable law, rules, or regulations.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P20_S0	We, from time to time, grant to our directors, executive officers and employees options to purchase our common stock under the Plans.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P20_S1	As of December 31, 2010, Invisa had no options to purchase shares of common stock outstanding or exercisable.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P21_S0	We do not have a 401(k) savings plan.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P22_S0	Our Officers and Directors are indemnified to the fullest extent provided by Nevada law.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P23_S0	We maintain a policy of directors and officers liability insurance to indemnify our directors and officers with respect to actions taken by them on our behalf.
1172706_11_ITEM11_P24_S0	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in such Act and is therefore unenforceable.
1172706_11_ITEM12_P0_S0	SECURITY OWNE RSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.
1172706_11_ITEM12_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2010 for:

1172706_11_ITEM12_P3_S1	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally requires that such person have voting or investment power with respect to securities.
1172706_11_ITEM12_P3_S2	In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person listed below and the percentage ownership of such person, shares of common stock underlying options, warrants or convertible securities held by each such person that are exercisable or convertible within 60 days of December 31, 2010 are deemed outstanding, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other person.
1172706_11_ITEM12_P4_S0	Except as otherwise noted below, and subject to applicable community property laws, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them.

1172706_11_ITEM12_P5_S1	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and includes voting power and/or investment power with respect to securities.
1172706_11_ITEM12_P5_S2	Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2010 are deemed outstanding for computing the number, and the percentages of outstanding shares beneficially owned by the person holding such options, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage beneficially owned by any other person.
1172706_11_ITEM13_P0_S0	Other than the compensation discussed herein, we had no items to disclose hereunder for 2009 except Mr. King had loaned $20,124 to the Company during 2007 and an additional $136 in 2008 aggregating $20,260.

1172706_11_ITEM14_P1_S1	Consistent with the Audit Committee s responsibility for engaging the Company s independent auditors, all audit and permitted non-audit services require pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

1172706_11_ITEM15_P4_S0	In accordance with the Exchange Act, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P5_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Invisa, Inc. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, stockholders (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P5_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).
1172706_11_ITEM15_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P6_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P6_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Invisa, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	Invisa, Inc., (the Company or Invisa ) is an enterprise that incorporates safety system technology and products into automated closure devices, such as parking gates, sliding gates, overhead garage doors and commercial overhead doors.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	Invisa has also demonstrated production-ready prototypes of security products for the museum and other markets.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P9_S2	The Company is currently manufacturing and selling powered closure safety devices.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	In preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at a major commercial bank.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P11_S2	Such amounts are occasionally in excess of the maximum federally insured amounts.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	Accounts receivable are due primarily from companies in the gate manufacturing industry located throughout the United States and the United Kingdom.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P12_S2	Account balances are evaluated for collectability based on the condition of the customers credit including repayment history and trends and relative economic and business conditions.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	Bad debts have not been significant.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	During 2009 Automatic Systems America was our largest customer, comprising approximately 11% of our product revenues.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	During 2010 Carolina Time Equipment Co., Inc. was our largest customer comprising of 11% of our sales.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	Cost is determined using an averaging method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	Inventory consists principally of finished goods and raw materials.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, principally five years.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P18_S2	Depreciation expense was $411 and $2,389 for 2009 and 2010 respectively.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P18_S3	As of December 31, 2010, all furniture, fixtures and equipment was fully depreciated.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Product sales under fixed price arrangements are recognized as revenue upon shipment of product (when title transfers to the purchaser) and collectability is assured.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	Other operating revenues relate to services and are recorded when services are complete.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the accompanying statements of operations.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Research and development costs consist of direct costs that are associated with the development of the Company s technology.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	These costs are expensed as incurred.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P23_S2	During the years 2009 and 2010, the Company did not incur research and development expense.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company s policy is to expense advertising costs as incurred.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company warrants its products for ninety days.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	Estimated warranty costs are recognized in the period product is shipped.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P25_S2	However, there have been no significant warranty costs incurred through December 31, 2010, nor are any significant amounts expected to occur subsequently.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P25_S3	Accordingly, no warranty liability has been recognized for any period presented.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company follows ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P27_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	Beginning January 1, 2007, we adopted ASC 740-10-05 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .
1172706_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P28_S3	The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-10-50, Fair Value Measurements.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	This guidance defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	The three levels are defined as follows:
1172706_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable and due to stockholders.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair value, due to the short-term nature of these items and the use of market rates of interest.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P33_S2	The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value based on the terms and conditions of similar debt instruments.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow risks or market-risk that may affect the fair values of its financial instruments.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	However, certain other financial instruments, such as warrants and embedded conversion features that are indexed to the Company s common stock, are classified as liabilities when either (a) the holder possesses rights to net cash settlement or (b) physical or net-share settlement is not within the control of the Company.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	In such instances, net-cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting, even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net-cash settlement.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P34_S3	Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets or asset groups, annually; or whenever adverse events or changes in business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	If the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	There were no impairments in 2009 or 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	During periods in which the Company incurs losses common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered, as their effect would be anti dilutive.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	At December 31, 2010 the preferred stock was convertible into 4,448,545 shares of common stock, which has not been considered in the calculation of diluted loss per share since the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	This Statement requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the financial statements.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P38_S2	The Statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment transactions.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified Accounting Statement Update (ASU) 2009-13 (ASU 2009-13), Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which eliminates the residual method of allocation, and instead requires companies to use the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	When applying the relative selling price method, the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists and otherwise using third-party evidence of selling price.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	If neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable, companies shall use their best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	ASU 2009-13 shall be effective in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with earlier application permitted.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	Companies may elect to adopt this guidance prospectively for all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption, or retrospectively for all periods presented.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	The Company will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2011.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2009-13 to have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	The amendments in this Update are effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	If a vendor elects early adoption and the period of adoption is not the beginning of the entity s fiscal year, the entity should apply the amendments retrospectively from the beginning of the year of adoption.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2010-17 to have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	In September 2004, the Company issued 22,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the face amount of $2,200,000 for $1,937,000 (net of $263,000 transaction expenses) which was paid in the respective amounts of $1,158,200 and $778,800 at closing.

1172706_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	The warrants expired on August 31, 2010 and were subject to call by the Company upon the Common Stock trading at a price of $3.00, a minimum trading volume of 12,000 shares for 20 consecutive days and the registration statement being effective.

1172706_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	The term of the warrants was three years.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Preferred Stock is non-voting and is entitled to receive dividends at an annual rate equal to the lower of the Prime Rate plus 3.5% or 9%.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	The dividend may either be paid in cash or registered shares of the Company s Common Stock, subject to certain limitations.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P53_S2	The Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at the option of the holder.

1172706_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	The aggregate 10,666,667 shares are not being treated as outstanding and will only be considered as being issued and outstanding if and when the shares are released by the escrow agent and delivered to the lender as a result of a default under the promissory notes and related security agreement.

1172706_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	Additionally, the credit facilities are secured by a security interest in 10,666,667 shares of the Company s common stock which are held in escrow.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P69_S3	Because the credit facilities are not in default the shares are not treated as issued and outstanding.

1172706_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The line bears interest at 10% per annum and is due on March 1, 2012.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Revolving Line has similar terms and provisions to the previous notes between the Company and the Senior Lender.

1172706_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	Reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate of 34.0% to the effective income tax rate is as follows at December 31:
1172706_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	ASC guidance requires that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P77_S2	As a result the Company recorded a valuation allowance with respect to all the Company s deferred tax assets.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P77_S3	The change in the valuation allowance was $30,000 during 2010.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company has a federal net operating loss carry forward of approximately $17 million as of December 31, 2010, which expires through 2030.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	Under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if an ownership change occurs with respect to a loss corporation , as defined, there are annual limitations on the amount of the net operating loss and other deductions, which are available to the Company.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Company has not determined the impact of these limitations at this time.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	The principal difference between the net operating loss and the accumulated deficit for financial statement purposes results principally from stock based compensation and other non-cash expenses.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	Since inception, we have been subject to tax by both federal and state taxing authorities.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	Until the respective statutes of limitations expire, we are subject to income tax audits in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1172706_11_ITEM15_P81_S2	We are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for fiscal years prior to 2007, and we are not subject to audits prior to the 2006 fiscal year for the state jurisdiction.

1172706_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	We acquired the InvisaShield presence-sensing technology in 2004.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Presence sensing is the repeatable detection of people and conductive objects within a certain perimeter of the sensor.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	InvisaShield technology detects objects at a distance of typically less than one meter.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	Invisa currently owns the patent and patent applications, as well as the sole rights to the InvisaShield technology in all markets worldwide.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our offices are located at 1800 2nd Street, Suite 965, Sarasota, FL 34236, telephone (941) 870-3950.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Many products use presence-sensing technology; however, we believe that our InvisaShield technology is particularly suited to safety sensors for use in the parking gate market.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2010 and 2011, all of our revenues were derived from the sale of SmartGate safety sensors used with powered parking gates.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	These gates typically have a power-operated barrier arm made of metal, wood or PVC.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	This arm moves vertically between an open and a closed position.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	Our device places an invisible presence-sensing field around the potentially dangerous barrier arm to detect people and vehicles in its path.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	Our device signals the powered gate to trigger a predetermined response, such as stopping and reversing the barrier arm.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P6_S6	The retail price for our SmartGate sensors allow us to realize an acceptable gross profit margin, however, we continue to look for ways to decrease our cost of goods and increase our distribution to improve our profit margins.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	We sell our safety products to manufacturers, dealers and end-users.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	As part of our current sales efforts, we have attended trade shows and have continued our relationships with our customer list which comprises manufacturers, dealers and end users.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	We also receive unsolicited orders either by telephone, fax or internet.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	In addition, during fiscal year 2011, we have sought relationships with architectural engineering firms and municipalities that are implementing projects requiring parking barrier gates, such as municipal parking lots and airport reconstruction.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Although we do not maintain a full-time sales force, we do engage outside sales consultants.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 2011, SkiData, Inc. was our largest customer comprising of 24% of our sales.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2010, Carolina Time Equipment Company was our largest customer, responsible for 11% of our product revenues.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	The sales to SkiData, Inc. in 2011 include a project that SkiData is administering for a large governmental end user and no assurance can be given that we will continue to sell products to SkiData at the same level once the project is complete.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	InvisaShield technology uses electronic circuitry that emits, controls, and monitors changes in an invisible energy field.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	The field is based, in part, upon low energy radio waves oscillating within a controlled frequency range.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	The field that is monitored can be varied in sensitivity from a distance of approximately one meter to a centimeter or less, depending upon the selected application.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	Circuitry constantly checks the field to test for the presence of people, vehicles or other conductive objects (objects that conduct electricity) that would disturb the monitored field.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that the InvisaShield technology is a novel and proprietary way to provide presence sensing.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	At the core of the technology is the ability to project a field or zone capable of detecting most conductive objects that enter the field.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	The field is projected from a metallic substance, referred to as an antenna, which may consist of wire, self-adhesive metallic tape or other metallic items.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	The technology allows flexibility in designing and locating the antenna.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	This may offer unique opportunities to place presence-sensing fields where they can be used more efficiently or effectively.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	This adaptability may permit the InvisaShield technology to perform non-contact presence-sensing tasks not currently possible with competing technologies and/or it may perform presence-sensing tasks similar to those performed by competing technologies, but in a more efficient, effective, and reliable manner.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	InvisaShield technology does not depend upon lenses, beams or reflectors, which may require replacement, cleaning and aligning.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Its operating environment, including electronic noise, mechanical noise, temperature, dust, frost, snow, ice or other operating conditions, generally does not disrupt the non-intrusive, non-contact presence-sensing capability of our technology.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have, in the past, sought to develop additional products based on our InvisaShield technology.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We have developed pre-production prototypes of safety products for various power doors such as slide-gates, commercial overhead doors, powered industrial doors (which are used in commercial, manufacturing and industrial facilities) and residential garage doors and pre-production prototypes of security products various applications in museums, retail and industrial.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	We have indefinitely delayed such development projects; however, in 2011 we made certain modifications improving our line of antenna products.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Competing Technologies - The presence-sensing business is highly competitive, consisting of numerous manufacturers of presence-sensing products based on various technologies, including infrared, ultrasonic, laser, microwave, and similar technologies.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	For the most part, these technologies have been in use for a number of years and, in many cases, may not be proprietary.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our competitors provide a variety of presence-sensing and other safety and security alternatives such as motion detectors, CCTV-based movement detection systems, infrared and visible light beam detectors, light curtains, on/off switching mats and pads, tape switches, contact edges, as well as others.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	In the safety and/or security sectors we compete with many companies, including MillerEdge, Stanley, Optex, Napco, Pelco, and DMP, along with other large and well-established firms such as Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, and Siemens.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater development, technical, marketing, sales and financial capabilities than we have.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result of these factors, competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and/or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	No. 7,187,282 issued on March 6, 2007.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	In addition, we have filed for two patents (as PCT, or Patent Cooperation Treaty filings), one provisional patent application and have one application pending, all of which cover improvements to the InvisaShield technology.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have a trademark on the trade name SmartGate which we use in our safety products category.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We have filed trademark applications for the following: Invisa , InvisaShield and the tagline Safe.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that our patent and trademark position will be useful in our efforts to protect our perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	All components and parts are modified or manufactured to our specifications by third parties or are otherwise generally available as off-the-shelf materials.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our products have a number of components including proprietary electronic circuitry manufactured to our specifications by third party manufacturers and a standard power supply available in the marketplace.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The antenna is standard wire, tape or other metallic materials, which can generally be purchased in bulk.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Whenever possible, we use fixed price manufacturing for our electronic circuitry, placing the responsibility for component supply on the manufacturer.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	We believe that there are multiple manufacturers and suppliers for each component and that adequate components and materials will be available to support our business plan.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	We perform some final assembly and predetermined quality control procedures in our facility using contractors, including contract piece work in connection with the assembly when needed.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	All shipping is done directly from our facility.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Federal Communications Commission regulates the use of radio frequency or RF , such as that used by our safety products.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	We currently have FCC Certification for our product.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	We will endeavor to continue satisfying all requirements of the FCC to maintain our FCC Certification.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	On March 1, 2001, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) implemented a new safety standard for the powered gate, door and window industry.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	This rule, UL-325, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows, and is a requirement for UL certification for certain powered gate, door and window operators.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	Gate and operator manufacturers that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification important for components most likely will require that our products be UL certified before incorporating our products as original equipment.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	We do not have a UL certification and the absence of UL certification for our products may represent a sales or marketing barrier in certain market categories and to certain customers.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our products have also earned the Conformit Europ enne marking (also known as CE mark) which is a mandatory conformity mark placed on many products used in the single market in the European Economic Area.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	The CE mark certifies that a product has met EU consumer safety, health or environmental requirements.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	This marking is mandatory for sales of products in approximately 27 European countries but is usually preferred by customers whether or not required in their respective countries.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	In addition to gaining the CE mark, our products are now RoHS compliant and have been since late 2008.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 2002/95/EC; commonly referred to as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive or RoHS) was adopted in February 2003 by the European Union and took effect in July 2006.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	This directive restricts the use of six hazardous materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ether), in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	By complying with the RoHS directive, our customers are assured that our products are free of these hazardous substances.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our safety products are sold with a 90-day limited warranty against manufactures parts and defects.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have had no significant claims expensed under the warranty in 2010 or 2011.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	We have no full time employees.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our Chief Executive Officer, who is currently our Chief Financial Officer, serves in both capacities on a part-time consulting basis.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	We support our operations by using consultants and third party contract piece workers as required .
1172706_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	We are not conducting any research and development with respect to our technology at this time.
1172706_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Therefore, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 we incurred no research and development expenses.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common stock.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. .
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We have historically incurred losses and losses are expected to continue in the future, which means that we may not be able to continue operations unless we obtain additional funding.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	In the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, we sustained a net loss from operations of $315,882.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Absent a dramatic increase in our market share or demand for our products, future losses are expected to continue.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Accordingly, we will experience significant liquidity and cash flow problems if we are not successful in increasing our sales and lowering costs.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	No assurances can be given that we will be successful in reaching or maintaining profitable operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability to manufacture and sell our products in sufficient volume to cover our fixed and variable costs of operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We will need to continue financing our operations through third party sources or we may be unable to fund our operations, promote our products or develop our technology.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In recent years, our operations have relied almost entirely on external financing to fund our operations; however, in 2011 sales revenues satisfied approximately 39% of our cash operational costs and expenses.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During 2010 and 2011, we funded our operations with funds borrowed under short-term and long-term notes which, for the most part, were secured with the Company s assets.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We anticipate, based on our current proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations, that the line of credit established by our Senior Lender will provide adequate funding to continue to operate our business through December 31, 2012.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Unless our sales increase significantly, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operating expenses beyond December 31, 2012.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We cannot assure you that financing, whether from external sources or related parties, will be available if needed or on favorable terms beyond December 31, 2012.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our secured debt, fund our operations and planned growth, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive market pressures, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our long-term business plan.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financing requirements could result in dilution to existing stockholders.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The additional financings we will require may be obtained through one or more transactions, which effectively dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Further, we may not be able to secure such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock, as well as additional classes or series of ownership interests or debt obligations that may be convertible into any one or more classes or series of ownership interests.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We are authorized to issue 95,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Such securities may be issued without the approval or other consent of our stockholders.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We anticipate that we will encounter difficulties and risks relating to our sales revenues, which include, but are not limited to, the introduction of new products, the ability to hire full time personnel, access to required capital, management issues, increasing our manufacturing capacity, and other similar aspects of operations which are important to our business operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We will be required to compete with larger, more established, and better financed companies.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There are a number of well-established companies that are well known in the manufacture and/or distribution of products for the security and life-safety markets.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Such companies include Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, Siemens and others.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to the difficult challenge of introducing and commercializing our new technology and products in a strong competitive environment.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Additionally, our technology and products based thereon will have to compete with other technologies such as passive infrared and various types of motion detection that are well known and well accepted.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We continue to experience uncertainty and risks related to market acceptance.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We continue our efforts to expand the market for our safety sensor product, to gain broader market acceptance and to demonstrate competitive advantages.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our success is dependent, to a large degree, upon our ability to successfully market our technology and its perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in connection with the operation of a small business in a highly competitive industry, characterized by frequent new product introductions.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We anticipate that we will continue to be disadvantaged by our limited revenues as they will inhibit our ability to expand our marketing and sales efforts in the domestic and international marketplace.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The limits of our of product liability insurance coverage may affect our Business.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may be exposed to potential product liability claims by consumers.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities to which we may be exposed.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Any product liability claim, even one that was not in excess of our insurance coverage or one that is meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition, the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Also, certain vendors may require minimum product liability insurance coverage as a condition precedent to purchasing or accepting products for retail distribution.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Product liability insurance coverage includes various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage, and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Failure to satisfy such insurance requirements could impede our ability or our distributors or licensees ability to achieve broad retail distribution of our proposed products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, the foundation of our business, which could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We regard certain aspects of our products, processes, services and technology as proprietary.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have taken steps to protect them with patents, copyrights, trademarks, restrictions on disclosure and other methods.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Despite these precautions, we cannot be certain that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights or that third parties will not independently develop similar products, services and technology.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any infringement, misappropriation or independent development could cause us to cease operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have issued patents and have filed patent applications with respect to various aspects of our technology.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The pending patent applications may not be issued to us, and if issued, may not protect our intellectual property from competition, which could seek to design around or invalidate these patents.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights in our products, services and technology could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend ourselves from claims of infringement, invalidity or unenforceability.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Litigation may be expensive and divert resources even if we win.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results such that it could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Other parties may assert that our technology infringes on their Intellectual property rights, which could divert management time and resources and possibly force our Company to redesign our technology.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Technology-based companies, such as ours, have the potential to be involved in litigation related to allegations of patent infringement.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although we have no knowledge of any such claims, from time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	While there currently are no outstanding infringement claims pending by or against us, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, that assertion by such parties will not result in costly litigation, or that they will not prevail in any such litigation.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or, alternatively, be able to redesign products on a cost-effective basis to avoid infringement.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any infringement claim or other litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on us and could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes, which could render our products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in technology, changes in customer requirements and preferences, introduction of products and services embodying new or different technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technology and products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and features of our technology and products.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We expect that our marketplace will require extensive technological upgrades and enhancements to accommodate many of the new products and services that we anticipate will be added to our marketplace.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand and upgrade our technology and systems, or successfully integrate new technologies or systems we develop in the future, to accommodate such increases in a timely manner.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may not be able to increase sales or if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth necessary to execute our business plan, which could adversely affect the quality of our operations and our costs.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In order to successfully execute our business plan, we must significantly increase our sales and revenue.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Additionally, we will need to increase the number of strategic partners, manufacturers, dealers, distributors and customers that use our products.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Lack of growth in sales and revenue will require that we continue to access financing which will subject us to the risks attendant thereto.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	On the other hand, if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, the resulting growth will place significant strain on our systems and resources.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In the event of growth, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, continue complying with all applicable regulations and expand our internal management, technical information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We cannot be sure that we will manage our growth effectively, and our failure to do so could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have no full time employees.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our Chief Financial Officer is also serving as our Chief Executive Officer and is available to the Company on a part time consulting basis.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We also engage consultants and contract piece workers as necessary.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Unless additional employees are hired, the limited size of our staff could restrict the level and/or nature of our business operations.
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have promissory notes payable that are secured by all of our assets and default under these notes could result in the loss of our assets .
1172706_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In order to fund our operations, we have entered into promissory notes payable that are secured by all of our assets.

1172706_12_ITEM11_P3_S0	Our compensation philosophy for our executive officers has been shaped by our lack of long-term financing and our severe shortage of operating capital.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P3_S1	Accordingly, our compensation decisions and particularly our approach to allocating compensation between cash and non-cash elements of the compensation package reflect our goal to preserve cash whenever possible.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P4_S0	In making our compensation decisions, we strive to be aware of the level of compensation which is paid to executive officers of various companies that we consider to be comparable to us in size.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P4_S1	Our goal is for the compensation paid to our named executive officers to be at or below the fiftieth percentile of the companies that we have identified as being comparable companies.

1172706_12_ITEM11_P11_S0	We have five stock plans as listed below:
1172706_12_ITEM11_P12_S0	All of the Plans have been approved by the Board of Directors and all, except for the 2006 Plan, have been approved by the Shareholders.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P12_S1	All of the plans authorize awards of incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options to employees, directors, and consultants of our company and affiliates.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P12_S2	The purposes of the Plans are as follows: to encourage and enable employees, directors, and consultants to acquire a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of our company; to generate an increased incentive for key employees and directors to contribute to our future success and prosperity, thus enhancing the value of our company for the benefit of our stockholders; and to enhance the ability of our company to attract and retain key employees and directors who are essential to progress, growth, and profitability.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board (the Administrator ).
1172706_12_ITEM11_P13_S1	All members of our Compensation Committee are non-employee directors and outside directors, as defined in the Plans.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P14_S0	Subject to the limitations set forth in the Plans, the administrator has the authority to grant options, to determine the purchase price of the shares of our common stock covered by each option, to establish the term of each option, to determine the number of shares of our common stock to be covered by each option, to establish vesting schedules, to designate options as incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, and to determine the persons to whom grants are to be made.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P15_S0	The Administrator establishes the option exercise price, which in the case of incentive stock options, must be at least the market price (as such term is defined in the Plans) of our common stock on the date of the grant or, with respect to optionees who own at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock (a 10% Stockholder ), 110% of the market price on the date of the grant.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P16_S0	Options granted under the Plans are generally not transferable by the optionee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to written agreement approved by the administrator relating to any non-qualified stock options in any manner authorized under applicable law.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P17_S0	Except as provided in the applicable stock option agreement, options must be exercised within 90 days of termination for any reason other than disability, retirement, or death, within one year of termination by disability or retirement, or by a designated beneficiary within two years of death.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P18_S0	Except as provided to the contrary in the option agreement, options granted under the Plans vest in one-third annual increments, beginning on the grant date of the option.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P18_S1	In no event may an incentive stock option be granted more than 10 years from the effective date of the plan or be exercised after either the expiration of 10 years from the grant date, or five years from the grant date in the case of a 10% Stockholder.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P19_S0	Incentive stock options may not vest for the first time with the respect to any optionee in a calendar year with a market price exceeding $100,000.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P19_S1	Any option grants that exceed that amount shall be automatically treated as non-statutory stock options.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P20_S0	The Plans may be suspended, terminated, modified, or amended by our board, but no such suspension, termination, modification, or amendment may adversely affect the terms of any option previously granted without the consent of the affected optionee, and any amendment will be subject to stockholder approval to the extent required by applicable law, rules, or regulations.
1172706_12_ITEM11_P21_S0	We, from time to time, grant to our directors, executive officers and employees options to purchase our common stock under the Plans.

1172706_12_ITEM11_P25_S0	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in such Act and is therefore unenforceable.

1172706_12_ITEM12_P1_S0	all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

1172706_12_ITEM12_P4_S1	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and includes voting power and/or investment power with respect to securities.
1172706_12_ITEM12_P4_S2	Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2011 are deemed outstanding for computing the number, and the percentages of outstanding shares beneficially owned by the person holding such options, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage beneficially owned by any other person.

1172706_12_ITEM15_P3_S0	In accordance with the Exchange Act, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P4_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Invisa, Inc. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the related statements of operations, stockholders (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P4_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).
1172706_12_ITEM15_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P5_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P5_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P6_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Invisa, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	Invisa, Inc., (the Company or Invisa ) is an enterprise that incorporates safety system technology and products into automated closure devices, such as parking gates, sliding gates, overhead garage doors and commercial overhead doors.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P8_S1	Invisa has also demonstrated production-ready prototypes of security products for the museum and other markets.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P8_S2	The Company is currently manufacturing and selling powered closure safety devices.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	In preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P10_S1	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at a major commercial bank.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P11_S0	Accounts receivable are due primarily from companies in the gate manufacturing industry located throughout the United States and the United Kingdom.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P11_S1	Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P11_S2	Account balances are evaluated for collectability based on the condition of the customers credit including repayment history and trends and relative economic and business conditions.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	Bad debts have not been significant.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P12_S1	During 2010 one customer comprised 11% of our sales.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P12_S2	During 2011 two customers comprised 37% of our sales.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using an averaging method which approximates the first-in, first-out method.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	The inventory has been evaluated for obsolescence and whether quantities on hand exceed quantities which can reasonably be expected to be sold in the near term.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P13_S2	Obsolete inventory is written off and excess quantities which are not expected to be sold in the near term are either written off or classified as a long-term asset.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, principally five years.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P14_S2	Depreciation expense was $2,389 and $0 for 2010 and 2011 respectively.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P14_S3	At December 31, 2011, all furniture, fixtures and equipment was fully depreciated.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	Product sales under fixed price arrangements are recognized as revenue upon shipment of product (when title transfers to the purchaser) and collectability is assured.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	Other operating revenues relate to services and are recorded when services are complete.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the accompanying statements of operations.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	Research and development costs consist of direct costs that are associated with the development of the Company s technology.

1172706_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company follows ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P23_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company follows ASC 740-10-05 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .
1172706_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P24_S2	For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P24_S3	The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company has adopted FASB ASC 820-10-50, Fair Value Measurements.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	This guidance defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P25_S2	The three levels are defined as follows:
1172706_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable and due to stockholders.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair value, due to the short-term nature of these items and the use of market rates of interest.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value based on the terms and conditions of similar debt instruments.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow risks or market-risk that may affect the fair values of its financial instruments.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	However, certain other financial instruments, such as warrants and embedded conversion features that are indexed to the Company s common stock, are classified as liabilities when either (a) the holder possesses rights to net cash settlement or (b) physical or net-share settlement is not within the control of the Company.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P30_S2	In such instances, net-cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting, even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net-cash settlement.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P30_S3	Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets or asset groups, annually; or whenever adverse events or changes in business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	If the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	There were no impairments in 2010 or 2011.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	During periods in which the Company incurs losses common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered, as their effect would be anti dilutive.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2011 the Preferred stock was convertible into 4,448,545 shares of common stock, which has not been considered in the calculation of diluted loss per share since the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	This Statement requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the financial statements.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	The Statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P34_S3	The Statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment transactions.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	This Update amended the provisions of FASB ASC 220-10 by eliminating the option of reporting other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	Companies will have the option of presenting net income and other comprehensive income in a single, continuous statement of comprehensive income or presenting two separate but consecutive statements of net income and comprehensive income.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P35_S3	The new presentation requirements are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P35_S4	The adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial statements.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	This Update amended the provisions of FASB ASC 350-20-35 by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P36_S3	Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P36_S4	The adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial statements.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company does not believe that other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.

1172706_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

1172706_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	The principal difference between the net operating loss and the accumulated deficit for financial statement purposes results principally from stock based compensation and other non-cash expenses.

1172706_12_ITEM15_P206_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1172706_12_ITEM15_P207_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Invisa, Inc. (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2011 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, Edmund C. King, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ss. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
1172706_12_ITEM15_P208_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and result of operations of the Company.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Invisa, Inc. is a Nevada corporation that manufactures and sells a line of SmartGate brand safety sensors used in or with parking gates to protect life and property.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Parking gates are motorized barriers used to control the flow of vehicular traffic in areas such as parking facilities, vehicle storage facilities, tollbooths, and metered entry points for highways.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our SmartGate sensors are based on presence sensing technology that we call InvisaShield.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	While we believe that our InvisaShield technology may have additional applications for safety products, to date substantially all of our revenue has been derived from the sale of SmartGate sensors used in parking gates.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We acquired the InvisaShield presence-sensing technology in 2004.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Presence sensing is the repeatable detection of people and conductive objects within a certain perimeter of the sensor.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	InvisaShield technology detects objects at a distance of typically less than one meter.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	Invisa currently owns the patent and patent applications, as well as the sole rights to the InvisaShield technology in all markets worldwide.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our offices are located at 1800 2nd Street, Suite 965, Sarasota, FL 34236, telephone (941) 870-3950.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Many products use presence-sensing technology; however, we believe that our InvisaShield technology is particularly suited to safety sensors for use in the parking gate market.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2011 and 2012, all of our revenues were derived from the sale of SmartGate safety sensors used with powered parking gates.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	These gates typically have a power-operated barrier arm made of metal, wood or PVC.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	This arm moves vertically between an open and a closed position.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	Our device places an invisible presence-sensing field around the potentially dangerous barrier arm to detect people and vehicles in its path.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P6_S5	Our device signals the powered gate to trigger a predetermined response, such as stopping and reversing the barrier arm.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P6_S6	The retail price for our SmartGate sensors allow us to realize an acceptable gross profit margin, however, we continue to look for ways to decrease our cost of goods and increase our distribution to improve our profit margins.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	We sell our safety products to manufacturers, dealers and end-users.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	As part of our current sales efforts, we have attended trade shows and have continued our relationships with our customer list which comprises manufacturers, dealers and end users.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	We also receive unsolicited orders either by telephone, fax or internet.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	In addition, during fiscal year 2012, we have sought relationships with architectural engineering firms and municipalities that are implementing projects requiring parking barrier gates, such as municipal parking lots and airport reconstruction.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Although we do not maintain a full-time sales force, we do engage outside sales consultants.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 2012, Ultimate Systems Solutions, LLC was our largest customer comprising 24% of our sales.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2011, SkiData, Inc. was our largest customer, also responsible for 24% of our product revenues.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	Ultimate Systems Solutions, LLC in 2012 included a single large project and no assurance can be given that we will continue to sell products to Ultimate Systems at the same level once the project is complete.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	InvisaShield technology uses electronic circuitry that emits, controls, and monitors changes in an invisible energy field.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	The field is based, in part, upon low energy radio waves oscillating within a controlled frequency range.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	The field that is monitored can be varied in sensitivity from a distance of approximately one meter to a centimeter or less, depending upon the selected application.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	Circuitry constantly checks the field to test for the presence of people, vehicles or other conductive objects (objects that conduct electricity) that would disturb the monitored field.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that the InvisaShield technology is a novel and proprietary way to provide presence sensing.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	At the core of the technology is the ability to project a field or zone capable of detecting most conductive objects that enter the field.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	The field is projected from a metallic substance, referred to as an antenna, which may consist of wire, self-adhesive metallic tape or other metallic items.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	The technology allows flexibility in designing and locating the antenna.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	This may offer unique opportunities to place presence-sensing fields where they can be used more efficiently or effectively.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P12_S4	This adaptability may permit the InvisaShield technology to perform non-contact presence-sensing tasks not currently possible with competing technologies and/or it may perform presence-sensing tasks similar to those performed by competing technologies, but in a more efficient, effective, and reliable manner.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	InvisaShield technology does not depend upon lenses, beams or reflectors, which may require replacement, cleaning and aligning.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Its operating environment, including electronic noise, mechanical noise, temperature, dust, frost, snow, ice or other operating conditions, generally does not disrupt the non-intrusive, non-contact presence-sensing capability of our technology.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have, in the past, sought to develop additional products based on our InvisaShield technology.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We have developed pre-production prototypes of safety products for various power doors such as slide-gates, commercial overhead doors, powered industrial doors (which are used in commercial, manufacturing and industrial facilities) and residential garage doors and pre-production prototypes of security products various applications in museums, retail and industrial.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	We have indefinitely delayed such development projects; however, in 2011 we made certain modifications improving our line of antenna products.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Competing Technologies - The presence-sensing business is highly competitive, consisting of numerous manufacturers of presence-sensing products based on various technologies, including infrared, ultrasonic, laser, microwave, and similar technologies.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	For the most part, these technologies have been in use for a number of years and, in many cases, may not be proprietary.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our competitors provide a variety of presence-sensing and other safety and security alternatives such as motion detectors, CCTV-based movement detection systems, infrared and visible light beam detectors, light curtains, on/off switching mats and pads, tape switches, contact edges, as well as others.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	In the safety and/or security sectors we compete with many companies, including MillerEdge, Stanley, Optex, Napco, Pelco, and DMP, along with other large and well-established firms such as Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, and Siemens.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater development, technical, marketing, sales and financial capabilities than we have.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result of these factors, competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and/or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	No. 7,187,282 issued on March 6, 2007.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	In addition, we have filed for two patents (as PCT, or Patent Cooperation Treaty filings), one provisional patent application and have one application pending, all of which cover improvements to the InvisaShield technology.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have a trademark on the trade name SmartGate which we use in our safety products category.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We have filed trademark applications for the following: Invisa , InvisaShield and the tagline Safe.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that our patent and trademark position will be useful in our efforts to protect our perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	All components and parts are modified or manufactured to our specifications by third parties or are otherwise generally available as off-the-shelf materials.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our products have a number of components including proprietary electronic circuitry manufactured to our specifications by third party manufacturers and a standard power supply available in the marketplace.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	The antenna is standard wire, tape or other metallic materials, which can generally be purchased in bulk.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Whenever possible, we use fixed price manufacturing for our electronic circuitry, placing the responsibility for component supply on the manufacturer.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	We believe that there are multiple manufacturers and suppliers for each component and that adequate components and materials will be available to support our business plan.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	We perform some final assembly and predetermined quality control procedures in our facility using contractors, including contract piece work in connection with the assembly when needed.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	All shipping is done directly from our facility.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Federal Communications Commission regulates the use of radio frequency or RF , such as that used by our safety products.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We currently have FCC Certification for our product.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	We will endeavor to continue satisfying all requirements of the FCC to maintain our FCC Certification.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	On March 1, 2001, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) implemented a new safety standard for the powered gate, door and window industry.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	This rule, UL-325, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows, and is a requirement for UL certification for certain powered gate, door and window operators.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	Gate and operator manufacturers that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification important for components most likely will require that our products be UL certified before incorporating our products as original equipment.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	We do not have a UL certification and the absence of UL certification for our products may represent a sales or marketing barrier in certain market categories and to certain customers.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our products have also earned the Conformit Europ enne marking (also known as CE mark) which is a mandatory conformity mark placed on many products used in the single market in the European Economic Area.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	The CE mark certifies that a product has met EU consumer safety, health or environmental requirements.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	This marking is mandatory for sales of products in approximately 27 European countries but is usually preferred by customers whether or not required in their respective countries.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	In addition to gaining the CE mark, our products are now RoHS compliant and have been since late 2008.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 2002/95/EC; commonly referred to as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive or RoHS) was adopted in February 2003 by the European Union and took effect in July 2006.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	This directive restricts the use of six hazardous materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ether), in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	By complying with the RoHS directive, our customers are assured that our products are free of these hazardous substances.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our safety products are sold with a 90-day limited warranty against manufactures parts and defects.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have had no significant claims expensed under the warranty in 2011 or 2012.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	We have no full time employees.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our Chief Executive Officer, who is currently our Chief Financial Officer, serves in both capacities on a part-time consulting basis.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	We support our operations by using consultants and third party contract piece workers as required .
1172706_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	We are not conducting any research and development with respect to our technology at this time.
1172706_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	Therefore, during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 we incurred no research and development expenses.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common stock.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. .
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We have historically incurred losses and losses are expected to continue in the future, which means that we may not be able to continue operations unless we obtain additional funding.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	In the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, we sustained a net loss from operations of $257,366.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Absent a dramatic increase in our market share or demand for our products, future losses are expected to continue.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Accordingly, we will experience significant liquidity and cash flow problems if we are not successful in increasing our sales and lowering costs.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	No assurances can be given that we will be successful in reaching or maintaining profitable operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability to manufacture and sell our products in sufficient volume to cover our fixed and variable costs of operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We will need to continue financing our operations through third party sources or we may be unable to fund our operations, promote our products or develop our technology.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In recent years, our operations have relied almost entirely on external financing to fund our operations; however, in 2012 sales revenues satisfied approximately 19% of our cash operational costs and expenses.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During 2011 and 2012, we funded our operations with funds borrowed under short-term and long-term notes which, for the most part, were secured with the Company s assets.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We anticipate, based on our current proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations, that the line of credit established by our Senior Lender will provide adequate funding to continue to operate our business through December 31, 2013.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Unless our sales increase significantly, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operating expenses beyond December 31, 2013.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We cannot assure you that financing, whether from external sources or related parties, will be available if needed or on favorable terms beyond December 31, 2013.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our secured debt, fund our operations and planned growth, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive market pressures, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our long-term business plan.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financing requirements could result in dilution to existing stockholders.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The additional financings we will require may be obtained through one or more transactions, which effectively dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Further, we may not be able to secure such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock, as well as additional classes or series of ownership interests or debt obligations that may be convertible into any one or more classes or series of ownership interests.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We are authorized to issue 95,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Such securities may be issued without the approval or other consent of our stockholders.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We anticipate that we will encounter difficulties and risks relating to our sales revenues, which include, but are not limited to, the introduction of new products, the ability to hire full time personnel, access to required capital, management issues, increasing our manufacturing capacity, and other similar aspects of operations which are important to our business operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We will be required to compete with larger, more established, and better financed companies.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There are a number of well-established companies that are well known in the manufacture and/or distribution of products for the security and life-safety markets.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Such companies include Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, Siemens and others.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to the difficult challenge of introducing and commercializing our new technology and products in a strong competitive environment.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Additionally, our technology and products based thereon will have to compete with other technologies such as passive infrared and various types of motion detection that are well known and well accepted.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We continue to experience uncertainty and risks related to market acceptance.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We continue our efforts to expand the market for our safety sensor product, to gain broader market acceptance and to demonstrate competitive advantages.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our success is dependent, to a large degree, upon our ability to successfully market our technology and its perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in connection with the operation of a small business in a highly competitive industry, characterized by frequent new product introductions.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We anticipate that we will continue to be disadvantaged by our limited revenues as they will inhibit our ability to expand our marketing and sales efforts in the domestic and international marketplace.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The limits of our of product liability insurance coverage may affect our Business.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may be exposed to potential product liability claims by consumers.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities to which we may be exposed.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Any product liability claim, even one that was not in excess of our insurance coverage or one that is meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition, the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Also, certain vendors may require minimum product liability insurance coverage as a condition precedent to purchasing or accepting products for retail distribution.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Product liability insurance coverage includes various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage, and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Failure to satisfy such insurance requirements could impede our ability or our distributors or licensees ability to achieve broad retail distribution of our proposed products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, the foundation of our business, which could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We regard certain aspects of our products, processes, services and technology as proprietary.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have taken steps to protect them with patents, copyrights, trademarks, restrictions on disclosure and other methods.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Despite these precautions, we cannot be certain that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights or that third parties will not independently develop similar products, services and technology.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any infringement, misappropriation or independent development could cause us to cease operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have issued patents and have filed patent applications with respect to various aspects of our technology.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The pending patent applications may not be issued to us, and if issued, may not protect our intellectual property from competition, which could seek to design around or invalidate these patents.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights in our products, services and technology could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend ourselves from claims of infringement, invalidity or unenforceability.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Litigation may be expensive and divert resources even if we win.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results such that it could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Other parties may assert that our technology infringes on their Intellectual property rights, which could divert management time and resources and possibly force our Company to redesign our technology.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Technology-based companies, such as ours, have the potential to be involved in litigation related to allegations of patent infringement.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although we have no knowledge of any such claims, from time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	While there currently are no outstanding infringement claims pending by or against us, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, that assertion by such parties will not result in costly litigation, or that they will not prevail in any such litigation.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or, alternatively, be able to redesign products on a cost-effective basis to avoid infringement.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any infringement claim or other litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on us and could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes, which could render our products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in technology, changes in customer requirements and preferences, introduction of products and services embodying new or different technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technology and products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and features of our technology and products.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We expect that our marketplace will require extensive technological upgrades and enhancements to accommodate many of the new products and services that we anticipate will be added to our marketplace.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand and upgrade our technology and systems, or successfully integrate new technologies or systems we develop in the future, to accommodate such increases in a timely manner.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may not be able to increase sales or if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth necessary to execute our business plan, which could adversely affect the quality of our operations and our costs.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In order to successfully execute our business plan, we must significantly increase our sales and revenue.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Additionally, we will need to increase the number of strategic partners, manufacturers, dealers, distributors and customers that use our products.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Lack of growth in sales and revenue will require that we continue to access financing which will subject us to the risks attendant thereto.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	On the other hand, if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, the resulting growth will place significant strain on our systems and resources.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In the event of growth, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, continue complying with all applicable regulations and expand our internal management, technical information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We cannot be sure that we will manage our growth effectively, and our failure to do so could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have no full time employees.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our Chief Financial Officer is also serving as our Chief Executive Officer and is available to the Company on a part time consulting basis.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We also engage consultants and contract piece workers as necessary.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Unless additional employees are hired, the limited size of our staff could restrict the level and/or nature of our business operations.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have promissory notes payable that are secured by all of our assets and default under these notes could result in the loss of our assets .
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In order to fund our operations, we have entered into promissory notes payable that are secured by all of our assets.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We currently do not have the available cash or other financing resources to pay the interest or principal there under.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Default under these promissory notes could result in the loss of all of our assets and business opportunity.
1172706_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The Senior Lender has liens on all of our assets.
1172706_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	In the February, 2012, we entered into a new lease agreement for our operations to rent approximately 2,000 square feet of office space located at 1800 2nd Street in Sarasota, Florida.
1172706_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our monthly base rental is $642.
1172706_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	We rent the facilities pursuant to a lease which expires on February 28, 2013.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Common Stock trades on the NASD OTC BB under the symbol INSA.OB.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the range of high and low bids to purchase our Common Stock during the last two fiscal years.

1172706_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	We believe that there are presently approximately five (5) market makers for our Common Stock.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	When stock is traded in the public market, characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness of the market may depend upon the existence of market makers as well as the presence of willing buyers and sellers.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	We do not know if these or other market makers will continue to make a market in our Common Stock.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	Further, the trading volume in our Common Stock has historically been both sporadic and light.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	Currently, the payment by the Company of dividends on its capital stock rests within the sole discretion of its Board of Directors.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	The payment of dividends will depend upon our earnings, our capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant factors.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P6_S2	The Company has not been required to or declared any cash dividends since its inception, and has no present intention of paying any cash dividends on its capital stock in the foreseeable future.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	Our policy with regard to the Series B Preferred Stock was to base any dividend paid on a rate that varies with the prime interest rate.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	The dividend was payable in either stock or cash at the option of the Company.
1172706_13_ITEM5_P7_S2	In January 2010, the Company restated its Series B Stock to eliminate any further accrual of dividends and provide that the Company may satisfy its obligation with respect to the accrued but unpaid dividends at that date either (a) in cash, (b) by issuance of additional shares of its Series B Stock or (c) by issuance of Common Stock of the Company.

1172706_13_ITEM11_P11_S0	We have five stock plans as listed below:
1172706_13_ITEM11_P12_S0	All of the Plans have been approved by the Board of Directors and all, except for the 2006 Plan, have been approved by the Shareholders.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P12_S1	All of the plans authorize awards of incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options to employees, directors, and consultants of our company and affiliates.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P12_S2	The purposes of the Plans are as follows: to encourage and enable employees, directors, and consultants to acquire a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of our company; to generate an increased incentive for key employees and directors to contribute to our future success and prosperity, thus enhancing the value of our company for the benefit of our stockholders; and to enhance the ability of our company to attract and retain key employees and directors who are essential to progress, growth, and profitability.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board (the Administrator ).
1172706_13_ITEM11_P13_S1	All members of our Compensation Committee are non-employee directors and outside directors, as defined in the Plans.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P14_S0	Subject to the limitations set forth in the Plans, the administrator has the authority to grant options, to determine the purchase price of the shares of our common stock covered by each option, to establish the term of each option, to determine the number of shares of our common stock to be covered by each option, to establish vesting schedules, to designate options as incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, and to determine the persons to whom grants are to be made.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P15_S0	The Administrator establishes the option exercise price, which in the case of incentive stock options, must be at least the market price (as such term is defined in the Plans) of our common stock on the date of the grant or, with respect to optionees who own at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock (a 10% Stockholder ), 110% of the market price on the date of the grant.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P16_S0	Options granted under the Plans are generally not transferable by the optionee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to written agreement approved by the administrator relating to any non-qualified stock options in any manner authorized under applicable law.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P17_S0	Except as provided in the applicable stock option agreement, options must be exercised within 90 days of termination for any reason other than disability, retirement, or death, within one year of termination by disability or retirement, or by a designated beneficiary within two years of death.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P18_S0	Except as provided to the contrary in the option agreement, options granted under the Plans vest in one-third annual increments, beginning on the grant date of the option.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P18_S1	In no event may an incentive stock option be granted more than 10 years from the effective date of the plan or be exercised after either the expiration of 10 years from the grant date, or five years from the grant date in the case of a 10% Stockholder.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P19_S0	Incentive stock options may not vest for the first time with the respect to any optionee in a calendar year with a market price exceeding $100,000.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P19_S1	Any option grants that exceed that amount shall be automatically treated as non-statutory stock options.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P20_S0	The Plans may be suspended, terminated, modified, or amended by our board, but no such suspension, termination, modification, or amendment may adversely affect the terms of any option previously granted without the consent of the affected optionee, and any amendment will be subject to stockholder approval to the extent required by applicable law, rules, or regulations.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P21_S0	We, from time to time, grant to our directors, executive officers and employees options to purchase our common stock under the Plans.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P21_S1	As of December 31, 2012, Invisa had no options to purchase shares of common stock outstanding or exercisable.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P22_S0	We do not have a 401(k) savings plan.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P23_S0	Our Officers and Directors are indemnified to the fullest extent provided by Nevada law.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P24_S0	We maintain a policy of directors and officers liability insurance to indemnify our directors and officers with respect to actions taken by them on our behalf.
1172706_13_ITEM11_P25_S0	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in such Act and is therefore unenforceable.
1172706_13_ITEM12_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2012 for:
1172706_13_ITEM12_P1_S0	all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

1172706_13_ITEM12_P2_S1	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally requires that such person have voting or investment power with respect to securities.
1172706_13_ITEM12_P2_S2	In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person listed below and the percentage ownership of such person, shares of common stock underlying options, warrants or convertible securities held by each such person that are exercisable or convertible within 60 days of December 31, 2012 are deemed outstanding, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

1172706_13_ITEM12_P6_S0	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and includes voting power and/or investment power with respect to securities.
1172706_13_ITEM12_P6_S1	Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012 are deemed outstanding for computing the number, and the percentages of outstanding shares beneficially owned by the person holding such options, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage beneficially owned by any other person.

1172706_13_ITEM15_P0_S0	The following exhibits are filed as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K:

1172706_13_ITEM15_P2_S0	Previously filed on June 23, 2003 with Invisa s Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2002 and are incorporated by reference.

1172706_13_ITEM15_P4_S0	KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS , that each of the undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints Edmund C.

1172706_13_ITEM15_P5_S0	In accordance with the Exchange Act, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P6_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Invisa, Inc. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, and the related statements of operations, stockholders (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P6_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P7_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).
1172706_13_ITEM15_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P7_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, audits of its internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P7_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P7_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P8_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Invisa, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	Invisa, Inc., (the Company or Invisa ) is an enterprise that incorporates safety system technology and products into automated closure devices, such as parking gates, sliding gates, overhead garage doors and commercial overhead doors.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	Invisa has also demonstrated production-ready prototypes of security products for the museum and other markets.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P10_S2	The Company is currently manufacturing and selling powered closure safety devices.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	In preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at a major commercial bank.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	Accounts receivable are due primarily from companies in the gate manufacturing industry primarily located throughout the United States.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P13_S2	Account balances are evaluated for collectability based on the condition of the customers credit including repayment history and trends and relative economic and business conditions.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	Bad debts have not been significant.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	During 2011 two customers comprised 37% of our sales.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	During 2012 three customers comprised 49% of our sales.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	The Company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using an averaging method which approximates the first-in, first-out method.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	The inventory has been evaluated for obsolescence and whether quantities on hand exceed quantities which can reasonably be expected to be sold in the near term.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P15_S2	Obsolete inventory is written off and excess quantities which are not expected to be sold in the near term are either written off or classified as a long-term asset.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, principally five years.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P16_S2	Depreciation expense was $0 for 2011 and 2012.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P16_S3	At December 31, 2012, all furniture, fixtures and equipment was fully depreciated.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	Product sales under fixed price arrangements are recognized as revenue upon shipment of product (when title transfers to the purchaser) and collectability is assured.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Other operating revenues relate to services and are recorded when services are complete.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the accompanying statements of operations.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	Research and development costs consist of direct costs that are associated with the development of the Company s technology.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	These costs are expensed as incurred.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P21_S2	During the years 2011 and 2012, the Company did not incur research and development expense.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company s policy is to expense advertising costs as incurred.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	The Company warrants its products for ninety days.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	Estimated warranty costs are recognized in the period product is shipped.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P23_S2	However, there have been no significant warranty costs incurred through December 31, 2012.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P23_S3	Accordingly, no warranty liability has been recognized for any period presented.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company follows ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P25_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P25_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company follows ASC 740-10-05 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .
1172706_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P26_S3	The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company has adopted FASB ASC 820-10-50, Fair Value Measurements.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	This guidance defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	The three levels are defined as follows:
1172706_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable and due to stockholders.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair value, due to the short-term nature of these items and the use of market rates of interest.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P31_S2	The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value based on the terms and conditions of similar debt instruments.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow risks or market-risk that may affect the fair values of its financial instruments.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	However, certain other financial instruments, such as warrants and embedded conversion features that are indexed to the Company s common stock, are classified as liabilities when either (a) the holder possesses rights to net cash settlement or (b) physical or net-share settlement is not within the control of the Company.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P32_S2	In such instances, net-cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting, even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net-cash settlement.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P32_S3	Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets or asset groups, annually; or whenever adverse events or changes in business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	If the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	There were no impairments in 2011 or 2012.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	During periods in which the Company incurs losses common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered, as their effect would be anti dilutive.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2012 the Preferred stock was convertible into 4,448,545 shares of common stock, which has not been considered in the calculation of diluted loss per share since the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	This Statement requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the financial statements.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	The Statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P36_S3	The Statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment transactions.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company does not believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	In September 2004, the Company issued 22,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the face amount of $2,200,000 for $1,937,000 (net of $263,000 transaction expenses) which was paid in the respective amounts of $1,158,200 and $778,800 at closing.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Issuance of Detachable Warrants to acquire up to 300,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock at $1.00 per share.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Warrants were to expire on August 16, 2007.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P39_S2	The terms of these Warrants were revised in August 2007 to extend the expiration date to August 2010 however the warrants were cancelled in 2008.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	In addition to the transaction costs referred to above, the Company granted 32,500 shares of Common Stock and Detachable Warrants to acquire up to 32,500 shares of the Company s Common Stock at $5.00 per share to a broker.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	The term of the Warrants was three years.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Preferred Stock is non-voting, entitled to dividends only when, or if, declared by the Board of Directors and has preference over the Common Stock in the event of the Company s liquidation.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	The Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at the option of the holder.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P41_S2	The conversion price was equal to 80% of the market price at the time of conversion, subject to a floor of $2.50 per share and a ceiling of $5.85 per share.
1172706_13_ITEM15_P41_S3	During 2005, the exercise price was modified to $0.60 per share as an inducement to execute the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock transaction discussed below.

1172706_13_ITEM15_P197_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Invisa, Inc. (the Company or Invisa ) on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2012 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, Edmund C. King, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
1172706_13_ITEM15_P198_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and result of operations of the Company.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Invisa, Inc. is a Nevada corporation that manufactures and sells a line of SmartGate brand safety sensors used in or with parking gates to protect life and property.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Parking gates are motorized barriers used to control the flow of vehicular traffic in areas such as parking facilities, vehicle storage facilities, tollbooths, and metered entry points for highways.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our SmartGate sensors are based on presence sensing technology that we call InvisaShield.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	While we believe that our InvisaShield technology may have additional applications for safety products, to date substantially all of our revenue has been derived from the sale of SmartGate sensors used in parking gates.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We acquired the InvisaShield presence-sensing technology in 2004.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Presence sensing is the repeatable detection of people and conductive objects within a certain perimeter of the sensor.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	InvisaShield technology detects objects at a distance of typically less than one meter.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	Invisa currently owns the patent and patent applications, as well as the sole rights to the InvisaShield technology in all markets worldwide.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our offices are located at 1800 2nd Street, Suite 965, Sarasota, FL 34236, telephone (941) 870-3950.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Many products use presence-sensing technology; however, we believe that our InvisaShield technology is particularly suited to safety sensors for use in the parking gate market.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2012 and 2013, all of our revenues were derived from the sale of SmartGate safety sensors used with powered parking gates.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	These gates typically have a power-operated barrier arm made of metal, wood or PVC.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	This arm moves vertically between an open and a closed position.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P6_S4	Our device places an invisible presence-sensing field around the potentially dangerous barrier arm to detect people and vehicles in its path.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P6_S5	Our device signals the powered gate to trigger a predetermined response, such as stopping and reversing the barrier arm.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P6_S6	The retail price for our SmartGate sensors allow us to realize an acceptable gross profit margin, however, we continue to look for ways to decrease our cost of goods and increase our distribution to improve our profit margins.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We sell our safety products to manufacturers, dealers and end-users.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	As part of our current sales efforts, we have attended trade shows and have continued our relationships with our customer list which comprises manufacturers, dealers and end users.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	We also receive unsolicited orders either by telephone, fax or internet.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	In addition, we have sought relationships with architectural engineering firms and municipalities that are implementing projects requiring parking barrier gates, such as municipal parking lots and airport reconstruction.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Although we do not maintain a full-time sales force, we do engage outside sales consultants.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 2013, Electro Automation, Ltd. was our largest customer comprising 27% of our sales.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2012, Ultimate Systems Solutions, LLC was our largest customer comprising 24% of our sales.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	InvisaShield technology uses electronic circuitry that emits, controls, and monitors changes in an invisible energy field.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The field is based, in part, upon low energy radio waves oscillating within a controlled frequency range.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	The field that is monitored can be varied in sensitivity from a distance of approximately one meter to a centimeter or less, depending upon the selected application.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	Circuitry constantly checks the field to test for the presence of people, vehicles or other conductive objects (objects that conduct electricity) that would disturb the monitored field.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that the InvisaShield technology is a novel and proprietary way to provide presence sensing.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	At the core of the technology is the ability to project a field or zone capable of detecting most conductive objects that enter the field.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	The field is projected from a metallic substance, referred to as an antenna, which may consist of wire, self-adhesive metallic tape or other metallic items.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	The technology allows flexibility in designing and locating the antenna.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	This may offer unique opportunities to place presence-sensing fields where they can be used more efficiently or effectively.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	This adaptability may permit the InvisaShield technology to perform non-contact presence-sensing tasks not currently possible with competing technologies and/or it may perform presence-sensing tasks similar to those performed by competing technologies, but in a more efficient, effective, and reliable manner.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	InvisaShield technology does not depend upon lenses, beams or reflectors, which may require replacement, cleaning and aligning.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Its operating environment, including electronic noise, mechanical noise, temperature, dust, frost, snow, ice or other operating conditions, generally does not disrupt the non-intrusive, non-contact presence-sensing capability of our technology.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have, in the past, sought to develop additional products based on our InvisaShield technology.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	We have developed pre-production prototypes of safety products for various power doors such as slide-gates, commercial overhead doors, powered industrial doors (which are used in commercial, manufacturing and industrial facilities) and residential garage doors and pre-production prototypes of security products various applications in museums, retail and industrial.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	We have indefinitely delayed such development projects.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Competing Technologies - The presence-sensing business is highly competitive, consisting of numerous manufacturers of presence-sensing products based on various technologies, including infrared, ultrasonic, laser, microwave, and similar technologies.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	For the most part, these technologies have been in use for a number of years and, in many cases, may not be proprietary.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our competitors provide a variety of presence-sensing and other safety and security alternatives such as motion detectors, CCTV-based movement detection systems, infrared and visible light beam detectors, light curtains, on/off switching mats and pads, tape switches, contact edges, as well as others.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	In the safety and/or security sectors we compete with many companies, including MillerEdge, Stanley, Optex, Napco, Pelco, and DMP, along with other large and well-established firms such as Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, and Siemens.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater development, technical, marketing, sales and financial capabilities than we have.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result of these factors, competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and/or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Trademarks - We have a trademark on the trade name SmartGate which we use in our safety products category.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We have filed trademark applications for the following: Invisa , InvisaShield and the tagline Safe.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	We believe that our patent and trademark position will be useful in our efforts to protect our perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	All components and parts are modified or manufactured to our specifications by third parties or are otherwise generally available as off-the-shelf materials.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our products have a number of components including proprietary electronic circuitry manufactured to our specifications by third party manufacturers and a standard power supply available in the marketplace.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	The antenna is standard wire, tape or other metallic materials, which can generally be purchased in bulk.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Whenever possible, we use fixed price manufacturing for our electronic circuitry, placing the responsibility for component supply on the manufacturer.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	We believe that there are multiple manufacturers and suppliers for each component and that adequate components and materials will be available to support our business plan.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	We perform some final assembly and predetermined quality control procedures in our facility using contractors, including contract piece work in connection with the assembly when needed.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P19_S4	All shipping is done directly from our facility.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Federal Communications Commission regulates the use of radio frequency or RF , such as that used by our safety products.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	We currently have FCC Certification for our product.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	We will endeavor to continue satisfying all requirements of the FCC to maintain our FCC Certification.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	On March 1, 2001, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) implemented a new safety standard for the powered gate, door and window industry.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	This rule, UL-325, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows, and is a requirement for UL certification for certain powered gate, door and window operators.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	Gate and operator manufacturers that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification important for components most likely will require that our products be UL certified before incorporating our products as original equipment.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	We do not have a UL certification and the absence of UL certification for our products may represent a sales or marketing barrier in certain market categories and to certain customers.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our products have also earned the Conformit Europ enne marking (also known as CE mark) which is a mandatory conformity mark placed on many products used in the single market in the European Economic Area.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The CE mark certifies that a product has met EU consumer safety, health or environmental requirements.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	This marking is mandatory for sales of products in approximately 27 European countries but is usually preferred by customers whether or not required in their respective countries.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	In addition to gaining the CE mark, our products are now RoHS compliant and have been since late 2008.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 2002/95/EC; commonly referred to as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive or RoHS) was adopted in February 2003 by the European Union and took effect in July 2006.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	This directive restricts the use of six hazardous materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ether), in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	By complying with the RoHS directive, our customers are assured that our products are free of these hazardous substances.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our safety products are sold with a 90-day limited warranty against manufactures parts and defects.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	We have had no significant claims expensed under the warranty in 2012 or 2013.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have no full time employees.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Financial Officer, serves in both capacities on a part-time consulting basis.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	We support our operations by using consultants and third party contract piece workers as required .
1172706_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We are not conducting any research and development with respect to our technology at this time.
1172706_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Therefore, during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 we incurred no research and development expenses.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common stock.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have historically incurred losses and losses are expected to continue in the future, which means that we may not be able to continue operations unless we obtain additional funding.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2013, we sustained a net loss of $357,855.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Absent a dramatic increase in our market share or demand for our products, future losses are expected to continue.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Accordingly, we will experience significant liquidity and cash flow problems if we are not successful in increasing our sales and lowering costs.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	No assurances can be given that we will be successful in reaching or maintaining profitable operations.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability to manufacture and sell our products in sufficient volume to cover our fixed and variable costs of operations.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We will need to continue financing our operations through third party sources or we may be unable to fund our operations, promote our products or develop our technology.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In recent years, our operations have relied almost entirely on external financing to fund our operations and in 2013 sales revenues satisfied approximately only 17% of our costs and expenses.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	During 2012 and 2013, we funded our operations with funds borrowed under short-term and long-term notes which, for the most part, were secured with the Company s assets.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We anticipate, based on our current proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations, that the line of credit established by our Senior Lender will provide adequate funding to continue to operate our business through December 31, 2014.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Unless our sales increase significantly, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operating expenses beyond December 31, 2014.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We cannot assure you that financing, whether from external sources or related parties, will be available if needed or on favorable terms beyond December 31, 2014.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our secured debt, fund our operations and planned growth, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive market pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business plan.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our financing requirements could result in dilution to existing stockholders.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Additional financings could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Further, we may not be able to secure such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock, as well as additional classes or series of ownership interests or debt obligations that may be convertible into any one or more classes or series of ownership interests.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We are authorized to issue 95,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Such securities may be issued without the approval or other consent of our stockholders.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We anticipate that we will encounter difficulties and risks relating to our sales revenues, which include, but are not limited to, the introduction of new products, the ability to hire full time personnel, access to required capital, management issues, increasing our manufacturing capacity, and other similar aspects of operations which are important to our business operations.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We will be required to compete with larger, more established, and better financed companies.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There are a number of well-established companies that are well known in the security and life-safety markets.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Such companies include Honeywell, Tyco, General Electric, Bosch, Siemens and others.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to the difficult challenge of introducing and commercializing our new technology and products in a strong competitive environment.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Additionally, our technology and products based thereon will have to compete with other technologies such as passive infrared and various types of motion detection that are well known and well accepted.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We continue to experience uncertainty and risks related to market acceptance.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We continue our efforts to expand the market for our safety sensor product, to gain broader market acceptance and to demonstrate competitive advantages.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our success is dependent, to a large degree, upon our ability to successfully market our technology and its perceived competitive advantages.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in connection with the operation of a small business in a highly competitive industry, characterized by frequent new product introductions.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We anticipate that we will continue to be disadvantaged by our limited revenues as they will inhibit our ability to expand our marketing and sales efforts in the domestic and international marketplace.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The limits of our of product liability insurance coverage may affect our business.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may be exposed to potential product liability claims by consumers.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities to which we may be exposed.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Any product liability claim, even one that was not in excess of our insurance coverage or one that is meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Also, certain vendors may require minimum product liability insurance coverage as a condition precedent to purchasing or accepting products for retail distribution.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Product liability insurance coverage includes various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage, and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Failure to satisfy such insurance requirements could impede our ability or our distributors or licensees ability to achieve broad retail distribution of our proposed products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, the foundation of our business, which could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We regard certain aspects of our products, processes, services and technology as proprietary.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We have taken steps to protect them with patents, copyrights, trademarks, restrictions on disclosure and other methods.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Despite these precautions, we cannot be certain that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights or that third parties will not independently develop similar products, services and technology.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any infringement, misappropriation or independent development could cause us to cease operations.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have issued patents and have filed patent applications with respect to various aspects of our technology.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The pending patent applications may not be issued to us, and if issued, may not protect our intellectual property from competition, which could seek to design around or invalidate these patents.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights in our products, services and technology could harm our business by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend ourselves from claims of infringement, invalidity or unenforceability.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Litigation may be expensive and divert resources even if we win.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results such that it could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Other parties may assert that our technology infringes on their Intellectual property rights, which could divert management time and resources and possibly force our Company to redesign our technology.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Technology-based companies, such as ours, have the potential to be involved in litigation related to allegations of patent infringement.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although we have no knowledge of any such claims, from time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	While there currently are no outstanding infringement claims pending by or against us, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, that assertion by such parties will not result in costly litigation, or that they will not prevail in any such litigation.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or, alternatively, be able to redesign products on a cost-effective basis to avoid infringement.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any infringement claim or other litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on us and could cause us to reduce or cease operations.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes, which could render our products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Changes in technology, changes in customer requirements and preferences, introduction of products and services embodying new or different technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technology and products less competitive or obsolete.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and features of our technology and products.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We expect that our marketplace will require extensive technological upgrades and enhancements to accommodate many of the new products and services that we anticipate will be added to our marketplace.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand and upgrade our technology and systems, or successfully integrate new technologies or systems we develop in the future, to accommodate such increases in a timely manner.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may not be able to increase sales or if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth necessary to execute our business plan, which could adversely affect the quality of our operations and our costs.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In order to successfully execute our business plan, we must significantly increase our sales and revenue.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Additionally, we will need to increase the number of strategic partners, manufacturers, dealers, distributors and customers that use our products.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Lack of growth in sales and revenue will require that we continue to access financing which will subject us to the risks attendant thereto.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	On the other hand, if we succeed in increasing sales and revenue, the resulting growth will place significant strain on our systems and resources.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In the event of growth, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, continue complying with all applicable regulations and expand our internal management, technical information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth.
1172706_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We cannot be sure that we will manage our growth effectively, and our failure to do so could cause us to reduce or cease operations.

1172706_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	When stock is traded in the public market, characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness of the market may depend upon the existence of market makers as well as the presence of willing buyers and sellers.

1172706_14_ITEM5_P7_S2	In January 2010, the Company restated its Series B Stock to eliminate any further accrual of dividends and provide that the Company may satisfy its obligation with respect to the accrued but unpaid dividends at that date either (a) in cash, (b) by issuance of additional shares of its Series B Stock or (c) by issuance of Common Stock of the Company.

1172706_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	We attributed the decrease in our sales in 2013 to reductions in sales to significant customers.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - During the years 2012 and 2013, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $237,185 and $307,617, respectively.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	The increase is attributable principally to Directors and Officers stock awards.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Interest (expense) and other, Net - The interest expense during 2012 of $67,550 and during 2013 of $111,090 relates primarily to financing costs and interest due to certain stockholders under lines of credit to the Company.

1172706_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	At December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,253.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We obtained funding of $170,353, in the form of short-term and long-term debt financing in 2012, and an additional $125,019 in 2013, which together with our cash from sales supported our operations.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have extended the maturity of our short-term debt to March 31, 2015, and have in place a line of credit which we believe is sufficient to finance our operations through December 31, 2014.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	(See Note G to accompanying financial statements).
1172706_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	In addition, we will explore other business opportunities such as licensing and business combinations as they may arise.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company has credit facilities with its Senior Lender totaling $1,235,428 under which $1,224,060 (including accrued interest) has been borrowed at December 31, 2013.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Senior Lender has also established a revolving line of credit to finance operations of the Company totaling $200,000 at December 31, 2013 which is available to the Company.

1172706_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	We believe that the line of credit facility and our sales revenue will be sufficient to finance our operations through December 31, 2014.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	However, we will continue to explore other avenues of financing, such as licensing of our product and/or our technology and potential strategic or business relationships or combinations, and to a lesser degree private equity and debt financing.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	While we are confident that the current funding and sales revenue available to us will be sufficient to finance our operations through December 31, 2014, it is important to note that additional funding, if needed, may not be available when required or it may not be available on acceptable terms.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Should we require additional funding, we may need to reduce or refocus our operations or obtain funds through arrangements that would be less attractive to us or which may require us to relinquish rights to certain or potential markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company does not believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	In preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

1172706_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Other operating revenues relate to services and are recorded when services are complete.
1172706_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation.

1172706_14_ITEM11_P3_S0	Our compensation philosophy for our executive officers has been shaped by our lack of long-term financing and our severe shortage of operating capital.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P3_S1	Accordingly, our compensation decisions and particularly our approach to allocating compensation between cash and non-cash elements of the compensation package reflect our goal to preserve cash whenever possible.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P4_S0	In making our compensation decisions, we strive to be aware of the level of compensation which is paid to executive officers of various companies that we consider to be comparable to us in size.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P4_S1	Our goal is for the compensation paid to our named executive officers to be at or below the fiftieth percentile of the companies that we have identified as being comparable companies.

1172706_14_ITEM11_P12_S1	All of the plans authorize awards of incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options to employees, directors, and consultants of our company and affiliates.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P12_S2	The purposes of the Plans are as follows: to encourage and enable employees, directors, and consultants to acquire a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of our company; to generate an increased incentive for key employees and directors to contribute to our future success and prosperity, thus enhancing the value of our company for the benefit of our stockholders; and to enhance the ability of our company to attract and retain key employees and directors who are essential to progress, growth, and profitability.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board (the Administrator ).
1172706_14_ITEM11_P13_S1	All members of our Compensation Committee are non-employee directors and outside directors, as defined in the Plans.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P14_S0	Subject to the limitations set forth in the Plans, the administrator has the authority to grant options, to determine the purchase price of the shares of our common stock covered by each option, to establish the term of each option, to determine the number of shares of our common stock to be covered by each option, to establish vesting schedules, to designate options as incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, and to determine the persons to whom grants are to be made.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P15_S0	The Administrator establishes the option exercise price, which in the case of incentive stock options, must be at least the market price (as such term is defined in the Plans) of our common stock on the date of the grant or, with respect to optionees who own at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock (a 10% Stockholder ), 110% of the market price on the date of the grant.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P16_S0	Options granted under the Plans are generally not transferable by the optionee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to written agreement approved by the administrator relating to any non-qualified stock options in any manner authorized under applicable law.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P17_S0	Except as provided in the applicable stock option agreement, options must be exercised within 90 days of termination for any reason other than disability, retirement, or death, within one year of termination by disability or retirement, or by a designated beneficiary within two years of death.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P18_S0	Except as provided to the contrary in the option agreement, options granted under the Plans vest in one-third annual increments, beginning on the grant date of the option.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P18_S1	In no event may an incentive stock option be granted more than 10 years from the effective date of the plan or be exercised after either the expiration of 10 years from the grant date, or five years from the grant date in the case of a 10% Stockholder.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P19_S0	Incentive stock options may not vest for the first time with the respect to any optionee in a calendar year with a market price exceeding $100,000.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P19_S1	Any option grants that exceed that amount shall be automatically treated as non-statutory stock options.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P20_S0	The Plans may be suspended, terminated, modified, or amended by our board, but no such suspension, termination, modification, or amendment may adversely affect the terms of any option previously granted without the consent of the affected optionee, and any amendment will be subject to stockholder approval to the extent required by applicable law, rules, or regulations.
1172706_14_ITEM11_P21_S0	We, from time to time, grant to our directors, executive officers and employees options to purchase our common stock under the Plans.

1172706_14_ITEM11_P25_S0	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in such Act and is therefore unenforceable.

1172706_14_ITEM15_P4_S1	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).

1172706_14_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, audits of its internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P5_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P5_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1172706_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	Estimated warranty costs are recognized in the period product is shipped.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P22_S2	However, there have been no significant warranty costs incurred through December 31, 2013.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P22_S3	Accordingly, no warranty liability has been recognized for any period presented.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	The Company follows ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P24_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company follows ASC 740-10-05 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .
1172706_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P25_S3	The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company has adopted FASB ASC 820-10-50, Fair Value Measurements.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	This guidance defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	The three levels are defined as follows:
1172706_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company s financial instruments typically include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable and due to officer ..
1172706_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair value, due to the short-term nature of these items.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value based on the terms, interest rate and conditions of similar debt instruments.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow risks or market-risk that may affect the fair values of its financial instruments.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P31_S1	However, certain other financial instruments, such as warrants and embedded conversion features that are indexed to the Company s common stock, are classified as liabilities when either (a) the holder possesses rights to net cash settlement or (b) physical or net-share settlement is not within the control of the Company.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P31_S2	In such instances, net-cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting, even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net-cash settlement.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P31_S3	Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P32_S2	During periods in which the Company incurs losses common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered, as their effect would be anti dilutive.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2013 the Preferred stock was convertible into 4,448,545 shares of common stock, which has not been considered in the calculation of diluted loss per share since the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	This Statement requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the financial statements.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	The Statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P34_S3	The Statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment transactions.
1172706_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company does not believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.

1172706_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	On March 1, 2001, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) implemented a new safety standard for the powered gate, door and window industry.
1172706_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	This rule, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows.
1172706_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Manufacturers of gates and operators that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification to be significant could require that our product be certified by UL.
1172706_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our safety sensor product is not UL certified.
1172706_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	The absence of UL certification could present a barrier to sales to potential customers.

1172706_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	When stock is traded in the public market, characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness of the market may depend upon the existence of market makers as well as the presence of willing buyers and sellers.

1172706_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 a total of 140,000 shares of common stock were issued to an aggregate of four directors and officers for services rendered in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM5_P8_S1	The Company charged the fair value of these shares to operations in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM5_P8_S2	However, the par value of these shares was recorded at the time of issuance of these shares in the first quarter of 2014.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion provides an analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of its operations and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	On November 10, 2014, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC ( Uniroyal ), and all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited ( EPAL ), the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Group) Limited ( Wardle Storeys ).
1172706_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	As further explained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto this transaction was treated as a combination between entities under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interest method.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Prior to its acquisition by Invisa, EPAL had acquired 100% of the common stock of Wardle Storeys on March 4, 2013 using acquisition accounting.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Therefore the combined operating results for 2013 only include the results of Wardle Storeys for the period March 4, 2013 through December 31, 2013 or approximately 10 months partially explaining the increases from year to year.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Wardle Storeys functional currency is the British Pound Sterling.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The average exchange rate for the Pound Sterling to the U.S. Dollar was approximately 5% higher in 2014 compared to 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Although it affected and increased each line item in 2014, the overall effect on net income was approximately $80,000 for the 2014 year compared to 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Total revenue in 2014 increased $3,556,575 or 3.8% to $98,323,226 from $94,766,651 in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The 2013 results only included 10 months for Wardle Storeys whereas 2014 included a full 12 months.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Assuming the Wardle Storeys transaction had occurred on January 1, 2013, total consolidated revenues would have shown a decrease of $5.4 million.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	The decrease was primarily due to the end of a one-year 2013 special automotive program that totaled approximately $6 million and the roll off of some legacy automotive platforms.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	The decrease in revenue was partially offset by new automotive platform launches and favorable impact of the change in the average Sterling exchange rate for 2014 compared to 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Total gross profit in 2014 was $19,318,986 or 19.6% of sales compared with $17,206,607 or 18.2% of sales in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Assuming the Wardle Storeys transaction had occurred on January 1, 2013, the consolidated gross profit would have been $18,375,994 or 17.7% of sales, an increase of approximately $943,000 despite lower revenue.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The gross profit percentage increased in 2014 primarily due to the rolling off of lower margin automotive platforms which were replaced with higher margin platforms and the positive results of cost efficiency programs implemented in 2013 and 2014.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Selling expenses in 2014 increased $985,318 or 26.6% to $4,691,974 from $3,706,656 in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Assuming the Wardle Storeys transaction had occurred on January 1, 2013, selling expenses would have only increased $456,326.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	The increase resulted primarily due to increases in administrative, marketing and support staff expenses and partially to the change in the exchange rate.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	General and administrative expenses in 2014 increased by $2,013,343 to $8,437,348 from $6,424,005 in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Assuming the Wardle Storeys transaction had occurred on January 1, 2013, general and administrative expenses would have only increased by $1,632,062.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Expenses increased in 2014 due to costs associated with the acquisition in the amount of $414,000 and increasing labor costs and administrative expenses necessary to prepare the Company to become a multinational SEC reporting company.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	Included in general and administrative expense is approximately $492,000 and $123,826 for 2014 and 2013, respectively, of statutory severance payments as a result of labor reduction programs at our U.K. facility.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	The severance program was fully expensed in 2014.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Research and development expenses in 2014 increased by $133,322 to $1,527,589 from $1,394,267 in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Assuming the Wardle Storeys transaction had occurred on January 1, 2013, research and development expenses would have only increased by $51,652, primarily due to increased development for new automotive platforms in 2014 and to the change in the exchange rate.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Interest expense in 2014 increased by $270,009 to $1,552,541 from $1,282,532 in 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Assuming the Wardle Storeys transaction had occurred on January 1, 2013, interest expense would have increased by $228,110, primarily due to the capital lease transaction on the Company s US manufacturing facility that was signed in November 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The gain on bargain purchase was associated with the acquisition of Wardle Storeys by EPAL on March 4, 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The purchase price was 2,910,000 or approximately $4,381,000.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were adjusted to their fair values.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Because the fair value of the net assets was greater than the purchase price, the Company recorded the difference of $4,646,046 as a gain on bargain purchase.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The income tax provision in 2013 is related to EPAL and calculated in accordance with the U.K. tax regulations.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Prior to its acquisition by the Company, Uniroyal, for tax purposes, was a pass-through LLC with the members being responsible to pay any federal and state income taxes.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Invisa, Inc., as a separate company, had a net operating loss and therefore did not incur a tax liability.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The benefit for 2014 in the amount of $1,340,682 is primarily related to a reduction in the Company s U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company had a deferred tax asset resulting from accumulated net operating losses but they had been fully reserved as of December 31, 2013 because the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	At December 31, 2014, the Company concluded after an analysis that it was now more likely than not that some of the asset would be realized and accordingly reduced the valuation allowance by $1,253,000, creating a tax benefit which is recognized in the operating results.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	During 2014, the Company filed in the U.K. a special return to claim tax deductions related to research and development expenses incurred during the tax periods 2012 and 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	This resulted in an addition to the deferred tax asset in the amount of $414,600 and, net of our regular provision on the U.K. operating results of $326,917, created a net benefit for the period of $87,682.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	The terms of the acquisitions in November 2014 resulted in the issuance of preferred ownership units/stock of UEP Holdings, LLC and EPAL to the sellers.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	These preferred units carried quarterly dividend requirements on a total value of $55,000,000 at rates ranging from 5% to 5.5%.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	The dividend reflected in the financial statements for the 2014 is the dividend payable for the period November 10, 2014 through December 31, 2014 which was paid in January 2015.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company maintains zero based cash accounts at its corporate offices in the U.S and minimal cash balances in the U.K. accounts for outstanding checks.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Cash as it is needed is provided by using the Company s lines of credit.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	These lines provide for a total borrowing commitment in excess of $40,000,000 subject to the underlying borrowing base specified in the agreements.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	At December 31, 2014, $16,396,306 is outstanding under these lines with additional availability of $2,977,011.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	The balances due under the lines of credit are recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Given our capital resources in the U.S. and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, we do not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Accordingly, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for these unremitted earnings.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	In the event that circumstances should change in the future and we decide to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations, the Company would record a tax expense and pay the applicable U.S. taxes on these repatriated foreign amounts.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, including the amount due under our lines of credit, was 1.15 at December 31, 2014 compared to 1.16 at December 31, 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Cash balances increased $293,205, after the effects of currency translation of $28,542, to $604,234 at December 31, 2014 from $311,029 at December 31, 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	This was a result of cash flows generated from operations during the year and the net increase in outstanding debt, offset by equipment purchases and distributions to members of Uniroyal.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Of the above noted amounts $480,803 and $290,455 were held outside the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Cash provided by operations was $4,195,458 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $6,485,445 for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Cash provided by operations during 2014 was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Cash provided by operations during 2013 was primarily due to operating income and decreased accounts receivables and inventories and offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Cash used in investing activities was $3,273,143 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $2,421,559 for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	During 2014, cash used for investing activities was principally for purchases of machinery and equipment at our manufacturing locations.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Of the $3,255,643 total capital expenditures for 2014, $2,504,998 was for the U.K. manufacturing facility and of this amount $1,603,236 was for the construction of a new production line.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	The total cost of the line will be approximately $2.3 million.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	We have arranged a financing lease for approximately $1.8 million which was funded in March 2015.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P20_S5	The proceeds from this lease will primarily be used to reduce the Company s U.K. line of credit.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P20_S6	During 2013, the Company used $681,340 of net cash to acquire Wardle Storeys.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Cash used in financing activities was $600,568 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3,873,691 for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	During both 2014 and 2013, cash used in financing activities included distributions to the former members of Uniroyal of $1,800,604 and $1,927,836, respectively, for taxes payable by the members as required by the member agreement.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Included in 2014 was an increase in long-term debt of $725,798 which primarily was from the term loan on equipment previously owned by the Company not previously financed.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	Included in 2013 was a net increase in related party debt obligations of $919,162 primarily used to acquireWardle Storeys and an increase in Company owned life insurance of $423,986.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We have revolving lines of credit commitment totaling in excess of $40,000,000 subject to the underlying borrowing base.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The lines bears interest at LIBOR plus a range of 2.15% to 3.15%, depending on the underlying borrowing base, or, at our option, at the bank's prime or base lending rate.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	At December 31, 2014 the outstanding borrowings were $16,396,306 with additional availability of $2,977,011.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	We plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs in fiscal 2015 and future periods.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our credit agreements contains customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2014.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We currently have several on-going capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our manufacturing plants.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	We will use a combination of financing arrangements to provide the necessary capital.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and our credit facilities, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	We have no material off balance sheet arrangements .
1172706_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	(a) Certain of our notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations pay interest at variable rates.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	In the contractual obligations table above, we have elected to apply estimated interest rates to determine the value of these future interest payments.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our critical accounting policies are described below.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenue is generally recognized when goods are shipped, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Based on historical results and analysis, we estimate and calculate provisions for customer rebates and sales returns and allowances and record as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounts receivable based on individual customer circumstances, historical write-offs and collections, and current industry and customer credit conditions, and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our policy regarding write-offs and collection efforts varies based on individual customer circumstances.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Past due accounts receivable are determined based on individual customer credit terms.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We value inventory at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We assess the recoverability of inventory and record a provision for obsolescence based upon specifically identified, discontinued, or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and forecasted usage and sales levels.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	These assessments, which require management s judgments and estimates, reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Long-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and property and equipment.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	We have deemed that our trademarks have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized unless we determine their useful lives are no longer indefinite.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Other intangible assets and property and equipment, excluding goodwill, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We review long-lived assets, including property, equipment, and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	We file income tax returns in the United States as a C-Corporation, and in several state jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Our subsidiary, Uniroyal, is a limited liability company (LLC) for federal and state income tax purposes and as such, its income, losses, and credits are allocated to its members.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	Prior to November 10, 2014, as the previous owners, the sellers were the sole members and reported the allocations on their personal tax returns.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	As a result, in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, there is no tax provision on its income prior to November 10, 2014.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	After this date, Uniroyal s income is allocated entirely to UEPH as its sole member.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	We then receive this income allocation as a member of UEPH less the dividends paid on the preferred units held by the former members of Uniroyal.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We follow ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $18 million as of December 31, 2014, which expires in years beginning 2018 through 2033.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	We have deferred tax assets as a result of these loss carryforwards which have been reduced by a valuation allowance to $1,253,000 at December 31, 2014.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our short-term financial instruments consist primarily of the following: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	We adjust the carrying value of financial assets denominated in other currencies such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the lines of credit using the appropriate exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	We believe that the carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	In determining the current interest rates for similar instruments, we take into account its risk of nonperformance.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	We believe that the carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The fair value of the our interest rate swaps are based on the estimated amounts that we would receive, or pay, to sell or transfer the swaps to a third party, taking into account current and future interest rates and our nonperformance risk and the counterparty.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our interest rate swaps are recorded at their estimated fair values in the accompanying balance sheets.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees (active or retired) who were employed prior to February 20, 1987.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	In calculating our plan obligations and related expense, we make various assumptions and estimates.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	These assumptions include discount rates, mortality rates, retirement rates, termination rates and other factors.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Under ASU 2014-09 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	The new standard will be effective for the Company January 1, 2017.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	The Company is in the process of determining what impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	On February 18, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The new standard affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	It will be effective for the Company January 1, 2016.
1172706_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	The Company is in the process of determining what impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	As a result of this common ownership and as required by current accounting pronouncements, the November 10, 2014 transaction was treated as a combination between entities under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interest method.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The tax effects from an uncertain tax position are recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	Prior to November 10, 2014, as the previous owners, the sellers were the sole members and reported the allocations on their personal tax returns.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P46_S3	As a result, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, there is no tax provision on its income prior to November 10, 2014.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments, which consist of interest rate swaps, as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, whether the hedge is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its variable interest rate long-term debt instruments.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	The gain or loss on the effective portion of interest rate swaps treated as cash flow hedges is initially included as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest on the related debt is paid.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	Currency exchange contracts are purchased for approximately 25% of the net risk.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P50_S4	These contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company s short-term financial instruments consist of the following: cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company adjusts the carrying value of financial assets denominated in other currencies such as cash, receivables, accounts payable and the lines of credit using the appropriate exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company believes that the carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	The fair value of the Company s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	In determining the current interest rates for similar instruments the Company takes into account its risk of nonperformance.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company believes that the carrying value of its long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps are the estimated amounts that the Company would receive, or pay, to sell or transfer the swaps to a third party, taking into account current and future interest rates and the nonperformance risk of the Company and the counterparty.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts which are recorded at their estimated fair values in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	The fair values of the currency exchange contracts are based upon observable market transactions of spot and forward rates.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, there have been no changes in the application of valuation methods applied to similar assets and liabilities.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for measuring, reporting, and disclosing fair value.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	These standards apply to all assets and liabilities that are measured, reported, and/or disclosed on a fair value basis.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	Assets and liabilities measured, reported and/or disclosed at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
1172706_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
1172706_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Unobservable inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	The asset s or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	The financial position and results of operations of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Revenue is generally recognized when goods are shipped, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	Based on historical results and analysis, we estimate and calculate provisions for customer rebates and sales returns and allowances and record as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.

1172706_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company calculates basic net income per common share by dividing net income after the deduction of preferred stock or preference dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	The calculation of diluted net income per share is consistent with that of basic net income per common share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is, securities such as options, warrants or convertible securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive.
1172706_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company s 28,541 shares of convertible preferred stock Series A, Series B and Series C can be converted into 4,756,833 common shares.

1172706_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	This rule, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows.
1172706_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Manufacturers of gates and operators that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification to be significant could require that our product be certified by UL.
1172706_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	The absence of UL certification could present a barrier to sales to potential customers.
1172706_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to develop new products, manufacturing processes, systems and technologies, while reducing costs to customers and enhancing existing product lines.

1172706_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our vinyl coated fabrics products have various high performance characteristics and capabilities.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	They are durable, stain resistant, easily processed, more cost-effective and better performing than traditional leather or fabric coverings.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our products are frequently used in applications that require rigorous performance characteristics such as automotive and non-automotive transportation, certain indoor/outdoor furniture, commercial and hospitality seating, healthcare facilities and athletic equipment.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	Materials that we manufacture come in a wide range of colors and textures and can be hand or machine sewn, laminated to an underlying structure, thermoformed to cover various substrates or made into a variety of shapes for diverse end-uses.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	We are a long-established supplier to the global automotive industry and manufacture products for interior soft trim components from floor to headliner which are produced to meet specific component production requirements such as cut and sew, vacuum forming/covering, compression molding, and high frequency welding.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	Some products are supplied with micro perforations, which are necessary on most compression molding processes.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P2_S6	Materials can also be combined with polyurethane or polypropylene foam laminated with either flame or hot melt adhesive for seating, fascia and door applications.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Products are developed and marketed based upon the performance characteristics required by end-users.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	For example, for recreational products used outdoors, such as boats, personal watercraft, golf carts and snowmobiles, a product designed primarily for water-based durability and weatherability is used.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also manufacture a line of products with our proprietary BeautyGard topcoats that contain agents to protect against staining and bacterial and fungal micro-organisms and can withstand repeated cleaning, a necessity in the restaurant and health care industries.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	These topcoats are environmentally friendlier than solvent-based topcoats.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The line is widely used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Flame and smoke retardant vinyl coated fabrics are used for a variety of commercial and institutional furniture applications, including hospitals, restaurants and residential care centers and seats for school busses and aircraft.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We currently conduct our operations in manufacturing facilities that are located in Stoughton, Wisconsin and Earby, England.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	On April 29, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company s name from Invisa, Inc. to Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	On June 25, 2015, the stockholders approved the amendment.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	On July 13, 2015, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Certificate of Amendment ) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change its name.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Certificate of Amendment became effective on July 15, 2015.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	The name change was approved by FINRA and became effective at the opening of trading on July 16, 2015 under our new ticker symbol UNIR .
1172706_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	In addition to the Company s new symbol, the Company s new CUSIP number is 90916U107.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P7_S6	The new address for the Company s Web site is www.uniroyalglobal.com .
1172706_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	On November 10, 2014, the Company acquired through its subsidiary UEP Holdings LLC ( UEPH ) all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC ( Uniroyal ), and acquired directly all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited ( EPAL ) the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Group) Limited ( Wardle Storeys ).
1172706_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	As further explained in the 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, this transaction was treated as a combination between entities under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interests method.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Effective with the current year, the Company changed its fiscal year to correspond to the reporting periods of its subsidiaries.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The current fiscal year is a 53-week year and ended on January 3, 2016.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	The current year s interim quarters ended on April 5, 2015, July 5, 2015 and October 4, 2015.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	The extra reporting week occurred during the first quarter ended April 5, 2015.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Wardle Storeys functional currency is the British Pound Sterling.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Wardle Storeys also has sales and purchases transactions that are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency, principally the Euro.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Approximately 27% of the Company s global revenues and 30% of its global raw material purchases are derived from these transactions.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The average exchange rates for the Pound Sterling to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro to the Pound Sterling were approximately 7.2% and 11.0%, respectively, lower in 2015 compared to 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Although these lower exchange rates decreased net sales by $6.6 million for the year ended January 3, 2016, it also decreased each line item in 2015.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	As a result, the overall negative effect on net income was reduced to approximately $1,344,000 for the year ended January 3, 2016, compared to the corresponding period of 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The following table sets forth, for the year ended January 3, 2016 ( Year-end 2015 ) and December 28, 2014 ( Year-end 2014 ), certain operations data including their respective percentage of net sales:
1172706_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Total revenue for the year ended 2015 increased $1,438,747 or 1.5% to $99,761,973 from $98,323,226 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Sales volumes and pricing for the year ended 2015 were ahead of the corresponding prior year period.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The increase was primarily due to new automotive platform launches and the additional reporting week included in 2015.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	The increase would have been approximately $8.1 million or 8.9% but it was offset by $6.6 million of unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates for 2015 compared to 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total gross profit for the year ended 2015 increased $2,629,633 or 13.6% to $21,948,619 from $19,318,986 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The gross profit percentage was 22.0% of sales for the year ended 2015 compared to 19.6% for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	The gross profit percentage increased in 2015 primarily due to the rolling off of lower margin automotive platforms which were replaced with higher margin platforms and the positive results of cost efficiency programs implemented during 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	The gross profit increase was offset by approximately $1.9 million of unfavorable impact of currency exchange rate changes.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling expenses for the year ended 2015 increased $509,225 or 10.9% to $5,201,199 from $4,691,974 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase resulted primarily due to increases in commissions and additional support staff expenses added during the second half of 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	General and administrative expenses for the year ended 2015 decreased by $658,336 or 7.8% to $7,779,012 from $8,437,348 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The expense decrease is principally due to $492,000 of statutory severance payments for the year ended 2014 as a result of labor reduction programs at our U.K. facility.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	The one-time expenses in 2014 due to costs associated with the acquisition in the amount of $414,000 were offset by higher labor and administrative costs in 2015 to prepare the Company to become a multinational SEC reporting company.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	Also contributing to the decrease was the effect of the currency exchange rates change for 2015 compared to 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Research and development expenses for the year ended 2015 increased by $201,278 or 13.2% to $1,728,967 from $1,527,589 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase was due to increased expenditures for new product development.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Operating income for the year ended 2015 increased by $2,577,466 or 55.3% to $7,239,541 from $4,662,075 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The operating income percentage was 7.3% of sales for the year ended 2015 compared to 4.7% for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	The increase was primarily due to the gross margin improvements.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	The amount of increase was offset by approximately $1,382,000 of unfavorable impact of currency exchange rate changes and increased selling expenses.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Interest expense for the year ended 2015 increased by $60,850 or 3.9% to $1,613,391 from $1,552,541 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	This increase was attributable to average debt and capital lease obligations being higher in 2015 compared to 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Other income (expenses) decreased $255,595 to other expense of $65,361 from other income of $190,234.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	The decrease was principally due to losses recognized on changes in fair values of financial instruments related to currency translations from Euro to the British Pound in the U.K. subsidiary for the year ended 2015 compared to net gains for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The tax benefits for 2015 and 2014 in the amounts of $2,193,054 and $1,340,682, respectively are primarily related to tax benefits recognized from the reduction in the Company s U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company had a deferred tax asset resulting from accumulated net operating losses but they had been fully reserved as of December 31, 2013 because the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	At December 28, 2014 and again at January 3, 2016, the Company concluded after an analysis at each period that it was now more likely than not that some of the asset would be realized and accordingly reduced the valuation allowance by $2,511,000 and $1,253,000 for the years ended January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, respectively, creating tax benefits which were recognized in the operating results.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	The benefits of these reductions were offset by the provisions on each period s year pre-tax income.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The terms of the acquisitions in November 2014 resulted in the issuance of preferred ownership units/stock of UEP Holdings, LLC and EPAL to the sellers.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	These preferred units carried quarterly dividend requirements on a total value of $55,000,000 at rates ranging from 5% to 5.5%.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	The dividends reflected in the financial statements for 2015 are the dividends for the full year.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The corresponding preferred dividend for 2014 was for the period from the acquisition date, November 10, 2014 through the end of the year.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Cash as it is needed is provided by using the Company s lines of credit.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	These lines provide for a total borrowing commitment in excess of $40,000,000 subject to the underlying borrowing base specified in the agreements.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	Of the total outstanding borrowings of $16,577,279 at January 3, 2016, $13,809,139 million of the lines bears interest at LIBOR plus a range of 1.95% to 2.45%, depending on the underlying borrowing base, or, at our option, at the bank s prime or base lending rate and $2.8 million bears interest at the bank s prime or base lending rate which was 3.50% at January 3, 2016.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	At January 3, 2016 the lines provided an additional availability of approximately $5.4 million.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	We plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs for fiscal 2016 and future periods.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The balances due under the lines of credit are recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Given our capital resources in the U.S. and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, we do not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Accordingly, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for these unremitted earnings.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	In the event that circumstances should change in the future and we decide to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations, the Company would record a tax expense and pay the applicable U.S. taxes on these repatriated foreign amounts.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, including the amount due under our lines of credit, was 1.22 at January 3, 2016 and 1.15 at December 28, 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Cash balances increased $1,305,878, after the negative effects of currency translation of $51,009, to $1,910,112 at January 3, 2016 from $604,234 at December 28, 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Of the above noted amounts, $1,357,877 and $480,803 were held outside the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, respectively.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Cash provided by operations was $5,301,256 for the year ended 2015 compared to $4,195,458 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Cash provided by operations during 2015 was primarily due to operating income offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and the net decrease in accounts payables and accrued expenses.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Cash provided by operations during 2014 was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments offset by increases in accounts receivable.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Cash used in investing activities was $2,927,196 for the year ended 2015 compared to $3,273,143 for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	During 2015, cash used for investing activities was principally for purchases of machinery and equipment at our manufacturing locations.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	Of the $2,782,525 total capital expenditures for 2015, $1,995,587 was for the U.K. manufacturing facility and of this amount, $850,577 was for the completion of a new production line.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	The total cost of the line was approximately $2.4 million.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	The Company arranged a financing lease for $1.7 million which was funded in March 2015.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P30_S5	The proceeds from this lease were used to reduce the Company s U.K. line of credit.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P30_S6	Included in cash used for investing activities was $107,502 for premiums paid on company owned life insurance for the year ended 2015.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	For the year ended 2015, financing activities used $1,017,173 of cash as compared to $600,568 used in financing activities for the year ended 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	As mentioned above, the company received in March 2015 $1.7 million related to a financing lease.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Also included in the increase was a new financing arrangement which provided $410,922 on equipment previously owned by the Company not previously financed.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	During the year ended 2015 the Company paid $2,479,665 of preferred dividends.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	During the year ended 2014, cash used in financing activities included distributions to the former members of Uniroyal of $1,800,604, for taxes payable by the members as required by the member agreement.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	Included in 2014 was an increase in long-term debt of $725,798 which primarily was from the term loan on equipment previously owned by the Company not previously financed.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our credit agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of January 3, 2016 and through the date of filing of this report.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	We currently have several on-going capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our manufacturing plants.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	We will use a combination of financing arrangements to provide the necessary capital.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and our credit facilities, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	We have no material off balance sheet arrangements.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	Our critical accounting policies are described below.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Revenue is generally recognized from product sale upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in accordance with the agreed upon customer terms when title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	Based on historical results and analysis, we estimate and calculate provisions for customer rebates and sales returns and allowances and record as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounts receivable based on individual customer circumstances, historical write-offs and collections, and current industry and customer credit conditions, and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our policy regarding write-offs and collection efforts varies based on individual customer circumstances.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Past due accounts receivable are determined based on individual customer credit terms.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	We value inventory at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	We assess the recoverability of inventory and record a provision for obsolescence based upon specifically identified, discontinued, or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and forecasted usage and sales levels.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	These assessments, which require management s judgments and estimates, reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Long-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and property and equipment.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	We have deemed that our trademarks have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized unless we determine their useful lives are no longer indefinite.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	Other intangible assets and property and equipment, excluding goodwill, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	We review long-lived assets, including property, equipment, and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	We file income tax returns in the United States as a C-Corporation, and in several state jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our subsidiary, Uniroyal, is a limited liability company (LLC) for federal and state income tax purposes and as such, its income, losses, and credits are allocated to its members.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Prior to November 10, 2014, as the previous owners, the sellers were the sole members and reported the allocations on their personal tax returns.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	As a result, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 28, 2014, there is no tax provision on its income prior to November 10, 2014.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	After this date, Uniroyal s income is allocated entirely to UEPH as its sole member.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	The Company then receives this income allocation as the sole member of UEPH less the dividends paid on the preferred units held by the former members of Uniroyal.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	We follow ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	We have a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $18 million as of January 3, 2016, which expires in years beginning 2018 through 2033.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We have deferred tax assets as a result of these loss carryforwards which have been reduced by a valuation allowances to $3,764,000 and $1,253,000 at January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, respectively.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.

1172706_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	We believe that the carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	In determining the current interest rates for similar instruments, we take into account its risk of nonperformance.

1172706_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense.

1172706_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Under ASU 2014-09 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	The new standard will be effective for the Company January 1, 2018.

1172706_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	The Company is in the process of determining what impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	On July 22, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory .
1172706_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The new standard requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is a change from the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method.

1172706_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Consistent with current Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	It will be effective for the Company on December 31, 2018.
1172706_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	The Company is in the process of determining what impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The tax effects from an uncertain tax position are recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company does not believe there is any uncertainty with respect to its tax positions which would result in a material change to the financial statements.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments, which consist of interest rate swaps, as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, whether the hedge is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its variable interest rate long-term debt instruments.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	The gain or loss on the effective portion of interest rate swaps treated as cash flow hedges is initially included as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest on the related debt is paid.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The fair value of the Company s long term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	In determining the current interest rates for similar instruments the Company takes into account its risk of nonperformance.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company believes that the carrying value of its long term debt approximates its estimated fair value.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 the Company did not have any interest rate swaps.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	The fair values of the currency exchange contracts are based upon observable market transactions of spot and forward rates.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, there have been no changes in the application of valuation methods applied to similar assets and liabilities.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for measuring, reporting, and disclosing fair value.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	These standards apply to all assets and liabilities that are measured, reported, and/or disclosed on a fair value basis.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	Assets and liabilities measured, reported and/or disclosed at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
1172706_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	Gains and losses on the derivative instrument representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The LIBOR swap rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full terms of the interest rate swaps and therefore are considered Level 2 items.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	As such, the Company s interest rate swap was considered a Level 2 item.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The preceding method described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation method is appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P104_S4	After this date, Uniroyal s income is allocated entirely to UEPH as its sole member.
1172706_16_ITEM8_P104_S5	The Company then receives this income allocation as a member of UEPH less the dividends paid on the preferred units held by the former members of Uniroyal.

1172706_16_ITEM8_P105_S3	The taxable income applicable to the distribution for the preferred ownership interests is reported to the members who report it on their respective individual tax returns.

1172706_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	It is difficult to predict future changes in environmental, health and safety regulations on our future financial results.
1172706_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	Continued compliance could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs.
1172706_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	Any increase in these costs, or unanticipated liabilities, arising out of a release of regulated material, discovery of previously unknown conditions, more aggressive enforcement actions or new requirements, could adversely affect our financial results.

1172706_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our safety sensor product has FCC Certification but is not UL certified.
1172706_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	On March 1, 2001, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) implemented a new safety standard for the powered gate, door and window industry.
1172706_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	This rule, while not a governmental regulation, is considered an indication of reasonable safety for powered gates, doors and windows.
1172706_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Manufacturers of gates and operators that rely upon UL certification or consider UL certification to be significant could require that our product be certified by UL.
1172706_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	The absence of UL certification could present a barrier to sales to potential customers.
1172706_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to develop new products, manufacturing processes, systems and technologies, while reducing costs to customers and enhancing existing product lines.

1172706_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	When stock is traded in the public market, characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness of the market may depend upon the existence of market makers as well as the presence of willing buyers and sellers.
1172706_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	We do not know if these or other market makers will continue to make a market in our Common Stock.
1172706_17_ITEM5_P5_S2	Further, the trading volume in our Common Stock has historically been both sporadic and light.

1172706_17_ITEM5_P8_S1	The Company charged the fair value of these shares to operations in 2013.
1172706_17_ITEM5_P8_S2	However, the par value of these shares was recorded at the time of issuance of these shares in the first quarter of 2014.
1172706_17_ITEM5_P9_S0	The following table provides information on repurchases by the Company of its securities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a leading provider of manufactured vinyl coated fabrics.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our best known brand, Naugahyde, is the product of many improvements on rubber-coated fabrics developed a century ago in Naugatuck, Connecticut.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	We design, manufacture and market a wide selection of vinyl coated fabric products under a portfolio of recognized brand names.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	We believe that our business has continued to be a leading supplier in its marketplace because of our ability to provide specialized materials with performance characteristics customized to the end-user specifications, complemented by technical and customer support for the use of our products in manufacturing.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our products have undergone considerable evolution and today are distinguished by superior performance in a wide variety of applications as alternatives to leather, cloth and other synthetic fabric coverings.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our standard product lines consist of more than 600 SKUs with combinations of colors, textures, patterns and other properties.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Our products are differentiated by unique protective top finishes, adhesive back coatings and transfer print capabilities.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	Additional process capabilities include embossing grains and patterns, and rotogravure printing, which imparts character prints and non-registered prints, lamination and panel cutting.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our vinyl coated fabrics products have various high performance characteristics and capabilities.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	They are durable, stain resistant, easily processed, more cost-effective and better performing than traditional leather or fabric coverings.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our products are frequently used in applications that require rigorous performance characteristics such as automotive and non-automotive transportation, certain indoor/outdoor furniture, commercial and hospitality seating, healthcare facilities and athletic equipment.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	Materials that we manufacture come in a wide range of colors and textures and can be hand or machine sewn, laminated to an underlying structure, thermoformed to cover various substrates or made into a variety of shapes for diverse end-uses.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	We are a long-established supplier to the global automotive industry and manufacture products for interior soft trim components from floor to headliner which are produced to meet specific component production requirements such as cut and sew, vacuum forming/covering, compression molding, and high frequency welding.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P2_S5	Some products are supplied with micro perforations, which are necessary on most compression molding processes.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P2_S6	Materials can also be combined with polyurethane or polypropylene foam laminated with either flame or hot melt adhesive for seating, fascia and door applications.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Products are developed and marketed based upon the performance characteristics required by end-users.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	For example, for recreational products used outdoors, such as boats, personal watercraft, golf carts and snowmobiles, a product designed primarily for water-based durability and weatherability is used.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also manufacture a line of products with our proprietary BeautyGard topcoats that contain agents to protect against staining and bacterial and fungal micro-organisms and can withstand repeated cleaning, a necessity in the restaurant and health care industries.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	These topcoats are environmentally friendlier than solvent-based topcoats.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The line is widely used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Flame and smoke retardant vinyl coated fabrics are used for a variety of commercial and institutional furniture applications, including hospitals, restaurants and residential care centers and seats for school busses and aircraft.

1172706_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	On April 29, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company s name from Invisa, Inc. to Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	On June 25, 2015, the stockholders approved the amendment.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	On July 13, 2015, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Certificate of Amendment ) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change its name.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Certificate of Amendment became effective on July 15, 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	The name change was approved by FINRA and became effective at the opening of trading on July 16, 2015 under our new ticker symbol UNIR .
1172706_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	In addition to the Company s new symbol, the Company s CUSIP number changed to 90916U107, and the new address for the Company s Web site changed to www.uniroyalglobal.com.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	On November 10, 2014, the Company acquired through its subsidiary UEP Holdings LLC ( UEPH ) all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC ( Uniroyal ), and acquired directly all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited ( EPAL ) the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Group) Limited ( Wardle Storeys ).
1172706_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	As further explained in the 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, this transaction was treated as a combination between entities under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interests method.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries have adopted a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 were 52-week and 53-week years, respectively.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our Earby, England operation s functional currency is the British Pound Sterling and has sales and purchases transactions that are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency, principally the Euro.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Approximately 22% of the Company s global revenues and 29% of its global raw material purchases are derived from these Euro transactions.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	The average year-to-date exchange rate for the Pound Sterling to the U.S. Dollar was approximately 11.4% lower and the average exchange rate for the Euro to the Pound Sterling was approximately 11.1% higher in 2016 compared to 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	These exchange rate changes had the net effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $2.9 million for the year ended January 1, 2017.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	Since the Pound Sterling exchange rate change also reduced the fixed expenses, the overall effect on net income was a positive amount of approximately $387,000 for the year ended January 1, 2017 compared to the year ended January 3, 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The following table sets forth, for the year-ended January 1, 2017 ( Year-end 2016 ) and January 3, 2016 ( Year-end 2015 ), certain operations data including their respective percentage of net sales:
1172706_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Total revenue for the year ended 2016 increased $615,305 or 0.6% to $100,377,278 from $99,761,973 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	As a result of several new programs, automotive sales increased 6.0% versus last year with increases in both the domestic and European markets.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Industrial sales declined 9.4% due to general weakness in the markets in which we compete.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Also contributing to the offset was that the year ended 2015 was a 53-week period compared to the 52-week period for the year ended 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	The extra week contributed approximately $500,000 to sales for 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	The net currency effect of the exchange rate change in the amount of $2.9 million further offset the increased sales from new programs.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P12_S6	Without the effect of the exchange rate change, total revenue would have increased by 3.6%.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Total gross profit for the year ended 2016 increased $913,343 or 4.2% to $22,861,962 from $21,948,619 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in gross profit resulted from continued efficiency improvements at our facilities and favorable raw material pricing and was partially offset by a negative net currency effect of $196,000 due to the exchange rate changes.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling expenses for the year ended 2016 decreased $122,493 or 2.4% to $5,078,706 from $5,201,199 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Increases in commissions on increased revenue compared to 2015 were offset by the net currency effect of the exchange rate changes.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	General and administrative expenses for the year ended 2016 increased by $229,963 or 3.0% to $8,008,975 from $7,779,012 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was primarily due to the recognition of $381,262 for the year ended 2016 in compensation expense related to a stock-based compensation plan approved in July 2015 compared to $98,566 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	Also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees and general business expenses due to increased activity.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	These increases were partially offset by the net currency effect of $352,000.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Research and development expenses for the year ended 2016 decreased by $1,251 or 0.1% to $1,727,616 from $1,728,867 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	An increase from increased expenditures for new product development was offset by the net currency effect of $89,000.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Operating income for the year ended 2016 increased by $807,124 or 11.1% to $8,046,665 from $7,239,541 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Operating income increased primarily from the gross margin increases resulting from continued efficiency improvements and favorable raw material pricing.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	Also contributing to the increase was approximately $392,000 from the net positive effect of the exchange rate change.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Interest expense for the year ended 2016 increased by $2,729 or 0.2% to $1,616,120 from $1,613,391 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	This increase was attributable to higher average debt and capital lease obligations and higher effective interest rates in 2016 compared to 2015 which was partially offset by a favorable currency effect.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Other expenses for the year ended 2016 increased $184,279 to $249,640 from $65,361 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The amount in other expense principally is the currency gains and losses recognized by the UK operations on foreign currency transactions and the change in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in Euros and U.S. Dollars.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company also recognizes gains and losses from the change in fair values on its foreign currency exchange contracts.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The tax benefits for 2016 and 2015 in the amounts of $1,198,557 and $2,193,054, respectively, are primarily related to tax benefits recognized from the reduction in the Company s U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	The Company had a deferred tax asset resulting from accumulated net operating losses but they had been fully reserved as of December 31, 2013 because the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	At January 3, 2016 and again at January 1, 2017, the Company concluded after an analysis at each period that it was now more likely than not that some or all of the asset would be realized and accordingly reduced the valuation allowance by $1,925,000 and $2,511,000 for the years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, respectively, creating tax benefits which were recognized in the operating results.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	The benefits of these reductions were offset by the provisions on each period s year pre-tax income.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	The terms of the acquisitions in November 2014 resulted in the issuance of preferred ownership units/stock of UEPH and Uniroyal Global (Europe) Limited (formerly EPAL) to the sellers.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	These preferred units carried quarterly dividend requirements on a total value of $55,000,000 at rates ranging from 5% to 6.5%.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Cash as it is needed is provided by using the Company s lines of credit.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	These lines provide for a total borrowing commitment in excess of $40,000,000 subject to the underlying borrowing base specified in the agreements.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Of the total outstanding borrowings of $16,799,592 at January 1, 2017, $13.1 million of the lines bears interest at LIBOR plus a range of 1.95% to 2.45%, depending on the underlying borrowing base, or, at our option, at the bank's prime or base lending rate and $3.7 million bears interest at the bank s prime or base lending rate which was 3.75% at January 1, 2017.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	At January 1, 2017 the lines provided an additional availability of approximately $3.4 million.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	We plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs for fiscal 2017 and future periods.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The balances due under the lines of credit are recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Given our capital resources in the U.S. and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, we do not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Accordingly, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for these unremitted earnings.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	In the event that circumstances should change in the future and we decide to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations, the Company would record a tax expense and pay the applicable U.S. taxes on these repatriated foreign amounts.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, including the amount due under our lines of credit, was 1.17 at January 1, 2017 and 1.22 at January 1, 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Cash balances decreased $588,526, after the negative effects of currency translation of $215,082, to $1,321,586 at January 1, 2017 from $1,910,112 at January 3, 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Of the above noted amounts, $970,327 and $1,357,877 were held outside the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, respectively.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cash provided by operations was $5,643,987 for the year ended 2016 compared to $5,301,256 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Cash provided by operations during 2016 was primarily due to operating income and by the increases in accounts payables and accrued expenses offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	Cash provided by operations during 2015 was primarily due to operating income which was offset by a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Cash used in investing activities was $2,356,518 for the year ended 2016 compared to $2,927,196 for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Cash used for investing activities was principally for purchases of machinery and equipment at our manufacturing locations.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	Included in cash used for investing activities were $324,809 and $107,502 from increases in cash surrender values on company owned life insurance for the year ended 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	For the year ended 2016, financing activities used $3,660,913 of cash as compared to $1,017,173 used in financing activities for the year ended 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Included in the proceeds from debt and capital lease obligations for the year ended 2015 was a financing lease for $1.7 million which was funded in March 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	This was for a new production line that was funded by the Company and completed during the first quarter of 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	The proceeds from this lease were used to reduce the Company s U.K. line of credit.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	Also included in the years ended 2016 and 2015 were new financing arrangements which provided $350,000 and $410,922, respectively, on equipment previously owned by the Company not previously financed.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	In May 2016, the Company modified the terms of the secured promissory note in the amount of $1,285,593 related to the Wardle Storeys acquisition and paid the note in full on May 31, 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	During the years ended 2016 and 2015 the Company paid $2,860,825 and $2,479,665, respectively, of preferred dividends.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our credit agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of January 1, 2017 and through the date of filing of this report.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	We currently have several on-going capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our manufacturing plants.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	We will use a combination of financing arrangements to provide the necessary capital.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and our credit facilities, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	We have no material off balance sheet arrangements.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P33_S4	Our critical accounting policies are described below.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Revenue is generally recognized from product sales upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in accordance with the agreed upon customer terms when title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Based on historical results and analysis, we estimate and calculate provisions for customer rebates and sales returns and allowances and record as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounts receivable based on individual customer circumstances, historical write-offs and collections, and current industry and customer credit conditions, and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our policy regarding write-offs and collection efforts varies based on individual customer circumstances.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Past due accounts receivable are determined based on individual customer credit terms.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	We value inventory at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	We assess the recoverability of inventory and record a provision for obsolescence based upon specifically identified, discontinued, or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and forecasted usage and sales levels.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	These assessments, which require management s judgments and estimates, reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Long-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and property and equipment.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	We have deemed that our trademarks have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized unless we determine their useful lives are no longer indefinite.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Other intangible assets and property and equipment, excluding goodwill, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We review long-lived assets, including property, equipment, and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the United States as a C-Corporation, and in several state jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Company s subsidiary, Uniroyal, is a limited liability company (LLC) for federal and state income tax purposes and as such, its income, losses, and credits are allocated to its members.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Prior to November 10, 2014, as the previous owners, the sellers were the sole members and reported the allocations on their personal tax returns.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	As a result, there was no tax provision on its income prior to November 10, 2014.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company made the acquisition of Uniroyal through UEPH, a limited liability company, which issued preferred ownership interests to the sellers that provide for quarterly dividends.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Uniroyal s post-acquisition taxable income is allocated entirely to UEPH as its sole member and since it is a pass-through entity, this income less the dividends paid to the sellers of Uniroyal is reported on the Company s tax return.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	The taxable income applicable to the dividends for the preferred ownership interests is reported to the sellers who report it on their respective individual tax returns.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	We follow ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	Future changes in such valuation allowance would be included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	We have a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $17 million as of January 1, 2016, which expires in years beginning 2018 through 2033.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	We have deferred tax assets as a result of these loss carryforwards which had been reduced by a valuation allowances to $3,764,000 at January 3, 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	Based on management s review at January 1, 2017, it was determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our short-term financial instruments consist primarily of the following: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We adjust the carrying value of financial assets denominated in other currencies such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the lines of credit using the appropriate exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	We believe that the carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	In determining the current interest rates for similar instruments, we take into account its risk of nonperformance.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	We believe that the carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	We provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees (active or retired) who were employed prior to February 20, 1987.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	In calculating our plan obligations and related expense, we make various assumptions and estimates.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	These assumptions include discount rates, mortality rates, retirement rates, termination rates and other factors.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Under ASU 2014-09 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The new standard will be effective for the Company January 1, 2018.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the effects this standard will have, if any, on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows together with evaluating the adoption date.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The new standard affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	It was effective for the Company on January 4, 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	On April 7, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	It was effective for the Company on January 4, 2016.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	On July 22, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory .
1172706_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The new standard requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is a change from the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	It was effective for the Company on January 2, 2017.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	The adoption of this standard for the year ending December 31, 2017 will not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	On November 20, 2015 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .
1172706_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Under the new guidance deferred tax liabilities and assets will be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	It was effective for the Company on January 2, 2017.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	The adoption of this standard for the year ending December 31, 2017 will not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows other than to reclassify the current deferred tax asset as of January 1, 2017 in the amount of $1,301,280 to the non-current deferred tax assets.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	On February 25, 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2016-02, Leases .
1172706_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Consistent with current Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	It will be effective for the Company on December 31, 2018.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the effects this standard will have, if any, on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows together with evaluating the adoption date.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	On March 30, 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The new standard involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	It was effective for the Company on January 2, 2017.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	The adoption of this standard for the year ending December 31, 2017 will not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	On August 26, 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The new standard applies to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.

1172706_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	The new standard modifies the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	It will be effective for the Company on December 30, 2019.
1172706_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the effects this standard will have, if any, on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows together with evaluating the adoption date.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1172706_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	UNIROYAL GLOBAL ENGINEERED PRODUCTS, INC. (the Company ) is primarily engaged in the development, manufacturing and distribution of vinyl coated fabrics primarily for use in transportation, residential, hospitality, health care, office furniture and automotive applications.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	The Company s customers are located primarily throughout North America and Europe.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	On April 29, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company s name from Invisa, Inc. to Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	On June 25, 2015, the stockholders approved the amendment.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	The amended and restated Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State and became effective on July 15, 2015.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	On November 10, 2014 the Company acquired all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC ( Uniroyal ), a U.S. manufacturer of textured coatings, and all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited ( EPAL ), the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Group) Limited ( Wardle Storeys ), a European manufacturer of textured coatings and polymer films.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	The Company made the acquisition of Uniroyal through its newly formed subsidiary, UEP Holdings, LLC ( UEPH ).
1172706_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	The aggregate purchase consideration paid for 100% of the outstanding equity of Uniroyal was preferred ownership interests issued by UEPH having a liquidation preference of $35 million.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P7_S2	See Note 14 for a description of the preferred units issued.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P7_S3	In a separate transaction, the Company purchased EPAL for 100 shares of the Company s Common Stock and the Company s guaranty of outstanding EPAL preferred stock retained by the seller, having a liquidation preference of 12,518,240 (approximately $20 million at closing).

1172706_17_ITEM8_P8_S1	As a result of this beneficial ownership, the seller controls in excess of 80% of the Company s voting rights in all matters to come before the Company s shareholders.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P8_S2	As a result of this common ownership , the November 10, 2014 transaction was treated as a combination between entities under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interest method.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P8_S3	The recognized assets and liabilities were transferred at their carrying amounts at the date of the transaction.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P8_S4	Further, the companies were also combined retrospectively for prior year comparative information to the extent permitted.

1172706_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	The years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 were 52-week and 53-week years, respectively.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

1172706_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	Assets and liabilities measured, reported and/or disclosed at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
1172706_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.

1172706_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Unobservable inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The asset s or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The financial position and results of operations of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while the capital accounts are translated at the historical rate for the date they were recognized.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1172706_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1172706_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 were both 52-week years.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our Earby, England operation s functional currency is the British Pound Sterling and has sales and purchases transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the Pound Sterling, principally the Euro.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Approximately 30% of the Company s global revenues and 34% of its global raw material purchases are derived from these Euro transactions.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The average year-to-date exchange rate for the Pound Sterling to the U.S. Dollar was approximately 4.9% lower and the average exchange rate for the Euro to the Pound Sterling was approximately 6.7% higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	These exchange rate changes had the net effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $552,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The overall effect on the Company s net loss was a positive amount of approximately $535,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended January 1, 2017 as the negative effect of the Pound Sterling was offset by the positive effect of the Euro.

1172706_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Total revenue for the year ended 2017 decreased $2,239,218 or 2.2% to $98,138,060 from $100,377,278 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Automotive sales for year-end 2017 decreased 1.5% compared to year-end 2016 as the increase in sales of several new programs in the European market was offset by a decline in the U.S. as automotive manufacturers adjusted their production due to a softening in the U.S. market.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Many of the U.S. automotive manufacturers idled production lines or entire assembly plants for multiple weeks to reduce inventories.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Industrial sales for the year-end 2017 were down 3.7% compared to the prior year period.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	Contributing to the decline was the net currency effect of the exchange rate change of approximately $552,000.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P15_S5	Without the effect of the exchange rate change, total revenue would have only decreased by 1.7%.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Total gross profit for the year ended 2017 decreased $4,450,282 or 19.5% to $18,411,680 from $22,861,962 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The gross profit percentage was 18.8% of sales for year-end 2017 compared to 22.8% for year-end 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	Gross profit was negatively impacted by rising raw material prices, unfavorable material usage variances and operating inefficiencies resulting from newly awarded automotive platforms ramping up in Europe.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	The decrease was partially offset by a positive net currency effect of $422,000.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	To offset raw material price increases, the Company increased prices in December in several of its markets.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Selling expenses for the year ended 2017 increased $35,020 or 0.7% to $5,113,726 from $5,078,706 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase was principally attributable to an increase in commissions from higher European automotive sales.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The increase was partially offset by the net currency effect of $49,000.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	General and administrative expenses for the year ended 2017 decreased $1,196,527 or 14.9% to $6,812,448 from $8,008,975 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	This decrease was a result of cost reduction programs which lowered employee costs, professional fees and other administrative expenses for year-end 2017 compared to year-end 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Also contributing to the decrease was the net currency effect of $125,000.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Research and development expenses for the year ended 2017 increased $213,055 or 12.3% to $1,940,671 from $1,727,616 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The increase resulted from additional staffing and increased expenditures for new product development.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	This was partially offset by the net currency effect of the exchange rate change of $38,000.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Operating income for the year ended 2017 decreased $3,501,830 or 43.5% to $4,544,835 from $8,046,665 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The operating income percentage was 4.6% of sales for year-end 2017 compared to 8.0% for year-end 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Operating income decreased primarily from the decrease in gross profit.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	This was partially offset by the reduction in operating expenses for year-end 2017 compared to 2016 and a positive net currency effect of $634,000.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Interest expense for the year ended 2017 increased $38,599 or 2.4% to $1,654,719 from $1,616,120 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The increase was primarily due to new capital leases for equipment purchases and higher interest rates on LIBOR and prime during year-end 2017 partially offset by debt repayments compared to year-end 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Other expense for the year ended 2017 decreased $168,429 to $81,211 from $249,640 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The amount in other expense principally is the currency gains and losses recognized by the U.K. operations on foreign currency transactions and the change in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in Euros and U.S. Dollars.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	The Company also recognizes gains and losses from the change in fair values on its foreign currency exchange contracts.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	For the year ended 2017, the tax provision was $2,916,118 as compared to a tax benefit of $1,198,557 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Included in the tax provision for 2017 was $1,937,070 related to write-downs of the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets due to a reduction in our marginal tax rate from 34% to 21%.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	The marginal tax rate was reduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	Also i ncluded in the tax provision for 2017 was $941,960 in tax expense related to a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an election may be made to pay the repatriation tax in eight installments, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	However, the Company will use a portion of its net operating loss carryforward to offset the repatriation tax owed.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The tax benefit for 2016 was primarily related to the tax benefit recognized from a $1,925,000 reduction in the Company s U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Based on management s review at December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, it was determined that a valuation allowance was not required since it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The terms of the acquisitions in November 2014 resulted in the issuance of preferred ownership units/stock of UEPH and Uniroyal Global (Europe) Limited (formerly EPAL) to the sellers.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	These preferred units carried quarterly dividend requirements on a total value of $55,000,000 at rates ranging from 5% to 7%.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The dividend rate on the Series B UEP Holdings preferred units which started at 5.5% increases by 0.5% on the anniversary of the issuance up to a maximum of 8.0%.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cash, as it is needed, is provided by using the Company s lines of credit.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	These lines provide for a total borrowing commitment in excess of $43,000,000 subject to the underlying borrowing base specified in the agreements.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Of the total outstanding borrowings of $19,340,468 at December 31, 2017, $14.9 million of the lines bears interest at LIBOR plus a range of 1.95% to 2.45%, depending on the underlying borrowing base , or, at our option, at the bank's prime or base lending rate and $4.4 million bears interest at the bank s prime or base lending rate which was 4.50% at December 31, 2017.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	At December 31, 2017, the lines provided an additional availability of approximately $2.4 million.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	The balances due under the lines of credit are recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Company also has commitments from several lending institutions for capital expenditure lines of credit totaling approximately $3.0 million.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	We plan to use the availability under the lines of credit at year-end 2017 and these commitments to help finance our cash needs for fiscal 2018.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Given our capital resources in the U.S. and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, we did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Accordingly, we had not recognized a deferred tax liability for these unremitted earnings.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	However, as discussed previously, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	For the year ended 2017, the Company recorded $941,960 in tax expense related to this repatriation tax.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	In the event that we decide to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations, the Company will not be required to pay any additional U.S. tax related to these amounts.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, including the amount due under our lines of credit, was 1.03 at December 31, 2017 and 1.13 at January 1, 2017.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Cash balances decreased $54,267, after the effects of currency translation of $99,102, to $1,267,319 at December 31, 2017 from $1,321,586 at January 1, 2017.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Of the above noted amounts, $1,152,039 and $970,327 were held outside the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Cash provided by operations was $5,562,511 for the year ended 2017 as compared to $5,643,987 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	For 2017, cash provided by operations was primarily due to adjustments for non-cash items of $4,818,133.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	For 2016, cash provided by operations was primarily due to net income of $7,379,462 adjusted for non-cash items of $735,409.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	The non-cash items were principally changes in deferred taxes and depreciation expense.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	These amounts were further adjusted by cash flows related to changes in working capital of $925,378 and $(2,506,747) for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and changes in other assets and liabilities of $(73,787) and $35,863 for 2017 and 2016, respectively .
1172706_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Cash used in investing activities was $2,894,081 for the year ended 2017 as compared to $2,356,518 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	During 2017 and 2016, cash used in investing activities was principally for purchases of machinery and equipment at our manufacturing locations.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Included in cash used in investing activities were increases in cash surrender values on company owned life insurance of $395,322, net of policy loans of $661,880, for the year ended 2017 and $324,809 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	For the year ended 2017, cash used in financing activities was $2,821,799 as compared to $3,660,913 for the year ended 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Included in cash used in financing activities were preferred dividend payments of $2,969,722 and $2,860,825 during the year ended 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	Also impacting cash used in financing activities for year-end 2017 and 2016 were net advances on the Company s lines of credit of $1,404,391 and $1,225,943, respectively.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	In May 2016, the Company modified the terms of the secured promissory note in the amount of $1,285,593 related to the Wardle Storeys acquisition and paid the note in full on May 31, 2016.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our credit agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2017 and through the date of filing of this report.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	We currently have several on-going capital projects that are important to our long-term strategic goals.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our manufacturing plants.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	We will use a combination of financing arrangements to provide the necessary capital.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and our credit facilities, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We have no material off balance sheet arrangements.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	Our critical accounting policies are described below.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Revenue is generally recognized from product sales upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in accordance with the agreed upon customer terms when title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	Based on historical results and analysis, we estimate and calculate provisions for customer rebates and sales returns and allowances and record these estimated amounts as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounts receivable based on individual customer circumstances, historical write-offs and collections, and current industry and customer credit conditions, and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our policy regarding write-offs and collection efforts varies based on individual customer circumstances.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Past due accounts receivable are determined based on individual customer credit terms.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	We value inventory at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	We assess the recoverability of inventory and record a provision for obsolescence based upon specifically identified, discontinued, or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and forecasted usage and sales levels.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	These assessments, which require management s judgments and estimates, reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Long-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and property and equipment.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	We have deemed that our trademarks have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized unless we determine their useful lives are no longer indefinite.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Other intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and property and equipment are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	We review long-lived assets, including property, equipment, and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the United States as a C-Corporation, and in several state jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The Company s subsidiary, Uniroyal, is a limited liability company (LLC) for federal and state income tax purposes and as such, its income, losses, and credits are allocated to its members.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Company made the acquisition of Uniroyal through UEPH, a limited liability company, which issued preferred ownership interests to the sellers that provide for quarterly dividends.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	Uniroyal s taxable income is allocated entirely to UEPH as its sole member and since it is a pass-through entity, this income less the dividends paid to the sellers of Uniroyal is reported on the Company s tax return.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	The taxable income applicable to the dividends for the preferred ownership interests is reported to the sellers who report it on their respective individual tax returns.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We follow ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences) using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets decreased to $3,167,092 due to a lower marginal tax rate to be applied to these assets.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	The marginal tax rate was reduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	Future changes in such valuation allowance would be included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	We have a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $16 million as of December 31, 2017, which expires in years beginning 2021 through 2034.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	As a result of these loss carryforwards, we have deferred tax assets in the amount of $3,167,092.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Based on management s review at December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, it was determined that a valuation allowance was not required since it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while the capital accounts are translated at the historical rate for the date they were recognized.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	Transaction gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our foreign operations are included in Other Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our short-term financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and lines of credit.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	We adjust the carrying value of financial instruments denominated in other currencies such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and lines of credit using the appropriate exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	We believe that the carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	In determining the current interest rates for similar instruments, we take into account its risk of nonperformance.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	We believe that the carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	We provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees (active or retired) who were employed prior to February 20, 1987.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	In calculating our plan obligations and related expense, we make various assumptions and estimates.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	These assumptions include discount rates, mortality rates, retirement rates, termination rates and other factors.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense.
1172706_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on accounting standards that the Company adopted during 2017 and on those recently issued but not yet required to be adopted.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements).
1172706_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P2_S3	As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P3_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2010.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. (the Company ) is primarily engaged in the development, manufacturing and distribution of vinyl coated fabrics primarily for use in transportation, residential, hospitality, health care, office furniture and automotive applications.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	The Company s customers are located primarily throughout North America and Europe.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	On April 29, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company s name from Invisa, Inc. to Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	On June 25, 2015, the stockholders approved the amendment.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	The amended and restated Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State and became effective on July 15, 2015.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	On November 10, 2014, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC ( Uniroyal ), a U.S. manufacturer of textured coatings, and all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited ( EPAL ), the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Earby) Limited ( Wardle Storeys ), a European manufacturer of textured coatings and polymer films.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company made the acquisition of Uniroyal through its newly formed subsidiary, UEP Holdings, LLC ( UEPH ).
1172706_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	The aggregate purchase consideration paid for 100% of the outstanding equity of Uniroyal was preferred ownership interests issued by UEPH having a liquidation preference of $35 million.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P8_S2	See Note 13 for a description of the preferred units issued.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	In a separate transaction, the Company purchased EPAL for 100 shares of the Company s Common Stock and the Company s guaranty of outstanding EPAL preferred stock retained by the seller, having a liquidation preference of 12,518,240 (approximately $20 million at closing).
1172706_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	These preferred shares were entitled to a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 625,912 per annum payable quarterly (approximately $1,000,000 at the date of the transaction).
1172706_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	On November 24, 2015, the liquidation preference was changed from 12,518,240 to 17,699,314 (approximately $18,851,539) and the payment of the quarterly dividend from 156,478 to 221,241 (approximately $235,644).
1172706_18_ITEM8_P9_S3	These conversions were based on the exchange rates on November 24, 2015.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	As a result of beneficial ownership between the principal owner of the Company and the seller of Uniroyal and EPAL, the seller controls in excess of 80% of the Company s voting rights in all matters to come before the Company s shareholders.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Assets and liabilities measured, reported and/or disclosed at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
1172706_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The asset s or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The financial position and results of operations of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while the capital accounts are translated at the historical rate for the date they were recognized.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P50_S3	The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P50_S4	Transaction gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our foreign operations are included in Other Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	Revenue is generally recognized from product sales upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in accordance with the agreed upon customer terms when title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	The calculation of diluted net income per share is consistent with that of basic net income per common share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is, securities underlying options, warrants or convertible securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is anti-dilutive.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Under ASU 2014-09, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	Based on the evaluation of the Company's current contracts and revenue streams, management believes that the adoption of this standard for the year ending December 30, 2018 will not have a significant effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows but will result in additional disclosures.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	The new standard requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is a change from the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Consistent with current Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	This standard will be effective for the Company on December 31, 2018.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	The following table summarizes the significant assumptions used in the model for the April 7, 2016 grant:
1172706_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	The Company based the expected volatility on comparable companies volatility because we determined that this was more reflective and a better indicator of the Company s expected volatility than our historical volatility.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	The historical stock price and volatility had been significantly different from the expected business activities over what will be the service period.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	On a quarterly basis, we assess changes to our estimate of expected option award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rates, if any, in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no forfeiture rate adjustments and future adjustments are not expected to be significant.
1172706_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 is as follows:
1172706_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	Option expense recognized was $405,280 and $381,262 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively.

1172706_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of earnings per common share - basic and earnings per common share diluted for the years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017:
