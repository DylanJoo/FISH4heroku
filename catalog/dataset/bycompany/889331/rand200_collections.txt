889331_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement the risk factors from time to time by other reports that we file with the SEC in the future.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competitive pressures.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We compete on the basis of price, quality, service and/or brand name across the industries and markets we serve.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Competitive pressures could affect the prices we are able to charge our customers or the demand for our products.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We may not always be able to compete on price, particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than Littelfuse.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	As other companies enter our markets or develop new products, competition may intensify further.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers needs.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The end markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses on capital investments.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Furthermore, the life cycles of our products may change and are difficult to estimate.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our future success will depend upon our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers needs.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We invest heavily in research and development without knowing that we will recover these costs.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our competitors may develop products or technologies that will render our products non-competitive or obsolete.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A work stoppage could occur at certain of our facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, we may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of our suppliers.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A significant work stoppage, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The transfer of our manufacturing operations and changes in our distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:
889331_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect us.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for our products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or shortages is limited.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have multiple sources of supply for the majority of our commodity requirements.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs, and the competitive position of our products and services.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot alw ays be predicted.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P14_S7	For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Operations and supply sources located outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to greater risks.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our operating activities outside the United States contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the company to place our production in countries outside the United States, including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our international operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations, including risks relating to the following:
889331_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are in the process of relocating our manufacturing operations and changing our distribution and customer service model.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to optimize its manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through restructurings, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may make further specific determinations to consolidate, close or sell additional facilities.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Possible adverse consequences related to such actions may include various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs, severance costs, impairments of goodwill and possibly an immediate loss of revenues, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate our business.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	These activities may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The success of these transactions depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these acquisitions.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Environmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes or in our finished goods.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Under these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	These releases or migrations may give rise to claims.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws and regulations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	To date there have been no claims by any regulatory agency that would require the company to incur regulatory environmental remediation.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The risk of environmental remediation exists and the company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries, and we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries as well as the success of our customers products.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Net sales to the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operat ions.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	For example, the automotive industry as well as the consumer electronics market is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	In addition, the global automotive and electronic industries have overall manufacturing capacity far exceeding demand.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P31_S5	To the extent that demand for certain of our customers products declines, the demand for our products may decline.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, interest rates or industry over-capacity may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, we could experience a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Fixed costs may reduce operating results if our sales fall below expectations.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future sales.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The volatility of our stock price could affect the value of an investment in our stock and our future financial position.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The market price of our stock has fluctuated widely.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Between January 2, 2010 and January 1, 2011, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $28.96 and a high of $48.75, experiencing greater volatility over that time than the broader markets.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as general economic conditions, industry conditions, analysts expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under Our Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P37_S4	We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock.
889331_11_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affec t our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock.

889331_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	The carrying amounts of total debt increased $10.8 million in 2010, compared to a decrease of $16.8 million in 2009 and an increase of $66.7 million in 2008, due to an increase in the amount borrowed under the revolving credit facility in 2010.
889331_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	The ratio of long-term debt to equity was 0.09 to 1 at year-end 2010, compared to 0.13 to 1 at year-end 2009 and 0.22 to 1 at year-end 2008.
889331_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	Further information regarding the company s debt is provided in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	The company started 2009 with $70.9 million of cash.
889331_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was approximately $29.6 million in the year and included $9.4 million in net income and $41.1 million in non-cash adjustments (primarily $36.6 million in depreciation and amortization), partially offset by $20.9 million of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
889331_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Changes in various operating assets and liabilities (including short-term and long-term items) that negatively impacted cash flows in 2009 consisted of decreases in accrued payroll and severance ($9.0 million), net decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses ($7.9 million), increases in accounts receivable ($15.6 million), decreases in accrued taxes ($3.3 million), and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets ($0.6 million), partially offset by decreases in inventory ($15.5 million).
889331_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	The company s capital expenditures were $22.4 million in 2010, $15.5 million in 2009 and $51.3 million in 2008.
889331_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Higher capital expenditures in 2008 were primarily related to facilities and equipment to support the manufacturing transfers to Asia and Mexico.
889331_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The company expects capital expenditures in 2011 will be approximately $29 to $32 million with the largest portion related to the completion of facility moves, capacity expansion and new product development.
889331_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	The company expects to fund 2011 capital investments from operating cash flows.
889331_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	The company s Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to 1 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, depending on market conditions.

889331_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of January 1, 2011:
889331_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	As of January 1, 2011, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
889331_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Specifically, the company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties; the company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and the company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets; and the company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
889331_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	In 2009, the company entered into derivative financial instruments.
889331_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Further information regarding these arrangements is provided in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in th is report.
889331_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept, changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets.
889331_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The guidance also revises earlier guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requires a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity, changes when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable interest entity, and requires enhanced disclosures related to an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities.
889331_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009.
889331_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	The company adop ted the new accounting guidance on January 3, 2010, which did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends earlier guidance addressing the accounting for contractual arrangements in which an entity provides multiple products or services (deliverables) to a customer.
889331_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The amendments address the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables and how arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting, when applicable, by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
889331_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific nor third-party evidence is available.
889331_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	The amendments also req uire that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
889331_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
889331_11_ITEM7_P59_S5	The company adopted the new accounting guidance on January 3, 2010, which did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends earlier guidance for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of guidance for recognizing revenue from the sale of software, but would be accounted for in accordance with other authoritative guidance.
889331_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with earlier application permitted.
889331_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	The company does not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued additional guidance to improve fair value disclosures and increase the transparency in financial reporting.
889331_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	These enhancements include: (1) a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers; and (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	This new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009.
889331_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	The company adopted the new accounting guidance on January 3, 2010, which did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In February 2010, the SEC issued a statement that reaffirms its support for the potential use of IFRS in the preparation of financial statements by U.S. registrants.
889331_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	It announced a work plan by which it is expected to make a determination in 2011 whether or not it will mandate the conversion to IFRS.
889331_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	As of October 2010, the SEC continues to anticipate making the determination in 2011 of whether, when, and how to incorporate IFRS into the U.S. domestic financial reporting system.
889331_11_ITEM7_P62_S3	The company is currently assessing the potential impact of IFRS on its Consolidated Financial Statements and will continue to review progress of the work plan.
889331_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations.
889331_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The guidance specified that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
889331_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
889331_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	The guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisit ion date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
889331_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	The company does not believe that the adoption of this new guidance will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued an authoritative guidance describing when to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
889331_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The amendments in this guidance modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
889331_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
889331_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist.
889331_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for i mpairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
889331_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	For public entities, the amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
889331_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	The company expects to adopt this new guidance effective the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and does not expect it to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position.
889331_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that a re inherently uncertain.
889331_11_ITEM7_P66_S4	The company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results, as they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_11_ITEM7_P66_S5	The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through dire ct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs and competition.
889331_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its ac count for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in-transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse.
889331_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	All distributors are independent of the company.
889331_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers.
889331_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Volume Rebates : The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts : The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life and quality issues.
889331_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	Based on the analysis, the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	The company has four reporting units for goodwill testing purposes.
889331_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 2, 2010, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no goodwill impairment existed.
889331_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 85%, 64%, 253% and 141% for its electronics, automotive, base electrical, and protection relay and custom products reporting units, respectively, at October 2, 2010.
889331_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 14% and a long-term growth rate of 3% for all four reporting units.
889331_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at October 2, 2010 that showed a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no goodwill impairment existed at October 2, 2010.
889331_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	The company evaluates long-lived asset groups on an ongoing basis.
889331_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	Long-lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable.
889331_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
889331_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
889331_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	The company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results.
889331_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	The company recorded asset impairment charges of $3.0 million, $0.8 million a nd $3.2 million for the fiscal years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively.
889331_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	Further information regarding asset impairments is provided in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure.
889331_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Littelfuse has a number of company-sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
889331_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	The company recognizes the full unfunded status of the plan on the balance sheet.
889331_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
889331_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_11_ITEM7_P96_S4	Further information regarding these plans is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded for stock-option grants, restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awards based upon the fair values of the awards.
889331_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	The fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
889331_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors.
889331_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options.
889331_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
889331_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	The company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to co ntinue making cash dividend payments in the foreseeable future.
889331_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The performance-based restricted stock awards granted in 2008 vest after a three-year performance period and are paid completely in the company s common stock at the end of the performance period.
889331_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	The fair value of performance-based restricted stock awards that are paid in common stock is measured at the market price on the grant date, and the fair value of the portion paid in cash is measured at the current market price of a share.
889331_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	The number of shares issued is based on the company attaining certain financial performance goals relating to return on net tangible assets ( RONTA ) for performance-based restricted stock awards granted prior to 2008, or return on net assets ( RONA ) for performance-based restricted stock granted in 2008, as well as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) during the three-year performance period after the grant date.
889331_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based restricted stock awards is based on the fair values and the company s current estimate of the probable number of shares to be issued (based on the probable outcome at the end of the performance period).
889331_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	As the company s estimate of the probable outcome changes in futur e periods, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.

889331_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	The company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
889331_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
889331_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	The company s 2010 performance significantly rebounded from 2009 across all sectors.

889331_11_ITEM7_P107_S4	Capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be in the range of $29.0 to $32.0 million.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodities.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The company had $74.0 million in debt outstanding at January 1, 2011, primarily related to the term loan, which is described above in Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources .
889331_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While the remaining portion of this debt has a variable interest rate, the company s interest expense is not materially sensitive to changes in interest rate levels since debt levels and potential interest expense increases are insignificant relative to earnings.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The majority of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The company has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Canada, Germany, China, Taiwan and the Philippines.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	During 2010, sales to customers outside the U.S. were 69.1% of total net sales.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan and Taiwanese dollars.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company s most significant long exposure is to the euro, with lesser long exposures to the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Korean won.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The company s most significant short exposures are to the Mexican peso, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The company uses netting and offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures where possible and also, from time to time, utilizes derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures deemed to be material.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold and silver.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the company s earnings.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper and zinc, where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change in copper would affect pretax profit by approximately $2.6 million.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P4_S3	A 10% change in zinc would affect pretax profit by approximately $0.8 million.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The cost of oil fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Consequently, there is a risk that a return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2011 could have a significant impact on the company s transportation and utility expenses.
889331_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the company is exposed to significant changes in certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, the company actively monitors these exposures and takes various actions to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

889331_11_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
889331_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889331_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance wi th authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889331_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889331_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Use of Estimates : The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes.
889331_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	The company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary.
889331_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
889331_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash Equivalents : All highly liquid investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
889331_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Investments : The company has determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
889331_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
889331_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in unrealized value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense (income), net.
889331_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
889331_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
889331_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments : The company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, derivative instruments and long-term debt.
889331_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	The carrying values of such financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
889331_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Accounts Receivable : The company performs credit evaluations of customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
889331_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based upon specific knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company.
889331_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Historically, credit losses have consistently been within management s expectations and have not been a material amount.
889331_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.
889331_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.
889331_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The company also maintains allowances against accounts receivable for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers.
889331_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.
889331_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (first in, first out method), which approximates current replacement cost.
889331_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	The company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
889331_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment : Land, buildings, and equipment are carried at cost.
889331_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 21 years for buildings, seven to nine years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three years for computer equipment.
889331_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Goodwill: The company annually tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	The company has four reporting units for testing purposes.
889331_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_11_ITEM8_P30_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization a s of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 2, 2010, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no goodwill impairment existed.
889331_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 85%, 64%, 253% and 141% for its electronics, automotive, base electrical, and protection relay and custom products reporting units, respectively, at October 2, 2010.
889331_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 14.0% and a long-term growth rate of 3% for all four reporting units.
889331_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at October 2, 2010 that showed a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no goodwill impairment existed at October 2, 2010.
889331_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Other Intangible Assets : Trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20 years.
889331_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of four to 12 years.
889331_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of four to 20 years.
889331_11_ITEM8_P34_S3	Other intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause the asset to be impaired.
889331_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Environmental Liabilities : Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits : Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_11_ITEM8_P37_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future pe riods and therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_11_ITEM8_P37_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	On April 1, 2009, the company elected to freeze its U.S. benefit plan.
889331_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	As a result of the freeze decision, the company remeasured its pension plan assets and obligations which resulted in a decrease in the net obligation at that date.
889331_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	See Note 12 for additional information.
889331_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Reclassifications : Certain items in the 2009 and 2008 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation.
889331_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through dire ct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_11_ITEM8_P42_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its ac count for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse, and all distributors are independent of the company.
889331_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	The company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers.
889331_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Volume Rebates : The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts : The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.

889331_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	The amendments address the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables and how arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting, when applicable, by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
889331_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific nor third-party evidence is available.

889331_11_ITEM8_P71_S2	This new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009.

889331_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
889331_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist.
889331_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for i mpairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
889331_11_ITEM8_P75_S2	For public entities, the amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.

889331_11_ITEM8_P112_S1	On the date the derivative is entered into, the company designates the derivative as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge, and accounts for the derivative in accordance with its designation.
889331_11_ITEM8_P112_S2	The company also formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
889331_11_ITEM8_P112_S3	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, the company discontinues hedge accounting, and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the respective measurement period.

889331_11_ITEM8_P121_S1	Fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
889331_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	Applicable accounting literature establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
889331_11_ITEM8_P122_S1	Applicable accounting literature defines levels within the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
889331_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable, such as pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques not based on market, exchange, dealer or broker-traded transactions.
889331_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy.

889331_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	The fair values of commodity derivatives are valued based on quoted futures prices for the underlying commodity and are categorized as Level 2.
889331_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	The fair values of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets and are categorized as Level 2.
889331_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	The company does not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during 2010 or 2009.

889331_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:
889331_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect us.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for our products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or shortages is limited.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have multiple sources of supply for the majority of our commodity requirements.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs, and the competitive position of our products and services.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Operations and supply sources located outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to greater risks.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our operating activities outside the United States contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the company to place our production in countries outside the United States, including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our international operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations, including risks relating to the following:
889331_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are in the process of relocating our manufacturing operations and changing our distribution and customer service model.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to optimize its manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through restructurings, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may make further specific determinations to consolidate, close or sell additional facilities.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Possible adverse consequences related to such actions may include various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs, severance costs, impairments of goodwill and possibly an immediate loss of revenues, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate our business.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	These activities may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The success of these transactions depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these acquisitions.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Environmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes or in our finished goods.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Under these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	These releases or migrations may give rise to claims.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws and regulations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The risk of environmental remediation exists and the company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries, and we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries as well as the success of our customers products.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Net sales to the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	For example, the automotive industry as well as the consumer electronics market is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	In addition, the global automotive and electronic industries have overall manufacturing capacity far exceeding demand.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P31_S5	To the extent that demand for certain of our customers products declines, the demand for our products may decline.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, interest rates or industry over-capacity may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, we could experience a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Fixed costs may reduce operating results if our sales fall below expectations.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future sales.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The volatility of our stock price could affect the value of an investment in our stock and our future financial position.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The market price of our stock has fluctuated widely.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Between January 2, 2011 and December 31, 2011, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $38.56 and a high of $64.82, experiencing greater volatility over that time than the broader markets.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as general economic conditions, industry conditions, analysts expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under Our Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P37_S4	We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
889331_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Also, we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.

889331_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various business unit segments to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of Littelfuse as a whole.
889331_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) dictates annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers.
889331_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Within U.S. GAAP, an operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources.
889331_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	The CODM is the company s President and Chief Executive Officer.
889331_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The company reports its operations by three business unit segments: Electronics, Automotive and Electrical.
889331_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The following table is a summary of the company s operating segments net sales by business unit and geography (in millions):
889331_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	(a) Sales by geography represent sales to customer or distributor locations.
889331_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	(b) During 2011, the company adjusted its business segment reporting methodology to report results by product line rather than by sales organization.
889331_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Accordingly, results for 2010 and 2009 have been restated to reflect this change.
889331_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	There was no change to total consolidated results.
889331_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	(c) 2011 includes Cole Hersee net sales of $46.9 million for fiscal year 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	(d) 2011 includes Selco net sales of $3.2 million for fiscal year 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Business unit segment information is described more fully in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	The following discussion provides an analysis of the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, and for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010.
889331_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales increased $57.0 million or 9% to $665.0 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $608.0 million in fiscal year 2010 due primarily to an incremental $50.1 million from business acquisitions and growth in protection relays, custom mining products and automotive products, offset by lower electronics sales.
889331_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The company also experienced $10.4 million in favorable foreign currency effects in 2011 as compared to 2010.
889331_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The favorable foreign currency impact primarily resulted from sales denominated in euros and, to a lesser extent, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen.
889331_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	Excluding acquisitions and currency effects, net sales decreased $3.5 million or 1% year over year.
889331_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Automotive business segment sales increased $58.5 million or 42% to $197.6 million.
889331_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	The Electronics business segment sales decreased $18.9 million or 5% to $354.5 million, and the Electrical business segment sales increased $17.4 million or 18% to $112.9 million.
889331_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Sales levels in 2011, excluding acquisitions and currency effects, were negatively impacted by slowing demand for the company s electronics products coupled with inventory de-stocking in the supply chain.
889331_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Sales levels in 2010 were positively impacted by the global economic recovery, distributor inventory replenishment and effective execution of the company s strategic growth plans.
889331_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The increase in Automotive sales was primarily due to an incremental $46.9 million in sales related to Cole Hersee, organic growth in all regions and favorable currency effects.
889331_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Excluding Cole Hersee, automotive sales increased $11.6 million or 8.4% year over year.
889331_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Currency effects added $4.3 million to sales in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the stronger euro.

889331_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	The company s capital expenditures were $17.6 million in 2011, $22.4 million in 2010, and $15.5 million in 2009.
889331_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The company expects capital expenditures in 2012 to increase to between $32 and $36 million primarily related to building expansions in Canada, the Philippines and Mexico to support the company s growth initiatives.
889331_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	The company expects to fund 2012 capital expenditures from operating cash flows.
889331_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	The company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the company s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2011 to April 30, 2012.
889331_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The company repurchased 859,029 shares of its common stock during 2011 under this program.
889331_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	On October 28, 2011, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization from 1,000,000 shares to 1,500,000 shares.
889331_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	This increase provided authority to purchase up to 640,971 additional shares between October 28, 2011 and the April 30, 2012 expiration date as of December 31, 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	The company withheld 20,537 shares of stock in lieu of withholding taxes on behalf of employees who became vested in restricted stock option grants during 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011:
889331_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.
889331_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	Specifically, the company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties; the company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and the company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets; and the company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
889331_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	In 2009, the company entered into derivative financial instruments.
889331_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Further information regarding these arrangements is provided in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
889331_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The new guidance will be effective for the company as of January 1, 2012 and will be applied prospectively.
889331_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
889331_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	The guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income, how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income.
889331_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	Because this guidance impacts presentation only, it will have no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on testing goodwill for impairment.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test).
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	The guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S4	In addition, the guidance does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S5	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S6	Early adoption is permitted; however the company did not adopt this guidance early.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S7	The company is evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance but currently believes there will be no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P63_S8	Goodwill testing was completed in October 2011 using the previous methodology, as permitted.
889331_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position.
889331_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	The company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results, as they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_12_ITEM7_P64_S5	The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs and competition.
889331_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in-transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse.
889331_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	All distributors are independent of the company.
889331_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	The company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers.
889331_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Volume Rebates: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	The company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life and quality issues.
889331_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Based on the analysis, the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	During 2011 and 2010, the company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting.
889331_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	This was aproximately $3.7 million in 2010 for Cole Hersee and $0.4 million in 2011 for Selco A/S.
889331_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	The company has seven reporting units for goodwill testing purposes.
889331_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_12_ITEM7_P85_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 1, 2011, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 84%, 96%, 41%, 14%, 88%, 131%, and 42% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), automotive (excluding Cole Hersee), Cole Hersee, relay, custom products, and fuse reporting units, respectively, at October 1, 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 14.5% for all reporting units except for Cole Hersee and a discount rate of 14.2% for Cole Hersee.
889331_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	A long-term growth rate of 3.0% was used for all seven reporting units.
889331_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at October 1, 2011 that showed either a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at October 1, 2011.
889331_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	The company evaluates long-lived asset groups on an ongoing basis.
889331_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	Long-lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable.
889331_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
889331_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
889331_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	The company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results.
889331_12_ITEM7_P90_S3	The company recorded asset impairment charges of $2.3 million, $3.0 million and $0.8 million for the fiscal years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively.
889331_12_ITEM7_P90_S4	Further information regarding asset impairments is provided in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure.
889331_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Littelfuse has a number of company-sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
889331_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	The company recognizes the full unfunded status of these plans on the balance sheet.
889331_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
889331_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_12_ITEM7_P94_S4	Further information regarding these plans is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded for stock-option grants and restricted share units based upon the fair values of the awards.
889331_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
889331_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors.
889331_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options.
889331_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
889331_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to continue making cash dividend payments in the foreseeable future.
889331_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense was $5.8 million, $5.2 million and $5.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
889331_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Further information regarding this expense is provided in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	The company accounts for income taxes using the liability method.
889331_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
889331_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	The company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
889331_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889331_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	Federal and state income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable.
889331_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	The company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
889331_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
889331_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The company s 2011 revenue, excluding acquisitions, was slightly (1%) better than 2010.
889331_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Total revenue, including acquisitions was $665.0 million in 2011 compared to revenue of $608.0 million in 2010.
889331_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	Strong organic growth in the Electrical (15%) and Automotive (9%) segments were offset by a decline in the Electronics segment.
889331_12_ITEM7_P104_S3	Revenues for 2012 are expected to be in the range of $680.0 to $720.0 million.
889331_12_ITEM7_P104_S4	Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $32.0 to $36.0 million.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodities.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The company had $85.0 million in debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, related to the unsecured revolving credit facility, which is described in Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources .
889331_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While this debt has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%, the company s interest expense is not materially sensitive to changes in interest rate levels since debt levels and potential interest expense increases are insignificant relative to earnings.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The majority of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The company has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Canada, Denmark, China, Taiwan and the Philippines.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	During 2011, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 66% of total net sales.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan and Taiwanese dollars.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company s most significant long exposure is to the euro, with lesser long exposures to the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Korean won.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The company s most significant short exposures are to the Mexican peso, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The company uses netting and offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures where possible and also, from time to time, utilizes derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures deemed to be material.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold and silver.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the company s earnings.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper, zinc, gold, and silver where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect annual pre-tax profit by approximately $2.0 million for copper, $0.6 million for zinc, $0.7 million for gold, and $0.6 million for silver.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	During 2011, the increase in gold and silver prices caused these commodities to become major cost components.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The cost of oil fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
889331_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Consequently, there is a risk that a return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2012 could have a significant impact on the company s transportation and utility expenses.

889331_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889331_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
889331_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
889331_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

889331_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have audited Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
889331_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	Littelfuse, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
889331_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889331_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889331_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889331_12_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
889331_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889331_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889331_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
889331_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	In our opinion, Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria .

889331_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	Use of Estimates : The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes.
889331_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	The company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary.
889331_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
889331_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Cash Equivalents : All highly liquid investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
889331_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Short-Term and Long-Term Investments : The company has determined that certain of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
889331_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
889331_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in unrealized value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense (income), net.
889331_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
889331_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
889331_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments : The company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments and long-term debt.
889331_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	The carrying values of such financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
889331_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Accounts Receivable : The company performs credit evaluations of customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
889331_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based upon specific knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company.
889331_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Historically, credit losses have consistently been within management s expectations and have not been a material amount.
889331_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.
889331_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.
889331_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	The company also maintains allowances against accounts receivable for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers.
889331_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.
889331_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (first in, first out method), which approximates current replacement cost.
889331_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	The company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
889331_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment : Land, buildings, and equipment are carried at cost.
889331_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 21 years for buildings, seven to nine years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three years for computer equipment.
889331_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: The company annually tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at other dates if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The company has seven reporting units for testing purposes.
889331_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_12_ITEM8_P35_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 1, 2011, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 84%, 96%, 41%, 14%, 88%, 131%, and 42% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), automotive (excluding Cole Hersee), Cole Hersee, relay, custom products, and fuse reporting units, respectively, at October 1, 2011.
889331_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 14.5% for all reporting units except for Cole Hersee which had discount rate of 14.2%.
889331_12_ITEM8_P36_S3	A long-term growth rate of 3.0% was used for all seven reporting units.
889331_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at October 1, 2011 that showed a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at October 1, 2011.
889331_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Other Intangible Assets : Trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20 years.
889331_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of seven to 12 years.
889331_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of three to 20 years.
889331_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	Other intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause the asset to be impaired.
889331_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Environmental Liabilities : Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits : Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_12_ITEM8_P42_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	On April 1, 2009, the company elected to freeze its U.S. benefit plan.
889331_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	As a result of the freeze decision, the company remeasured its pension plan assets and obligations which resulted in a decrease in the net obligation at that date.
889331_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	See Note 12 for additional information.
889331_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	Reclassifications : Certain items in the 2010 and 2009 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation.
889331_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	These reclassifications had no impact on net income or shareholders equity for any period.
889331_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_12_ITEM8_P47_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_12_ITEM8_P47_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_12_ITEM8_P48_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse, and all distributors are independent of the company.
889331_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	The company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers.
889331_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	Volume Rebates: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	However, due to the company s diverse customer base and lack of credit concentration, the company does not believe its estimates would be materially impacted by changes in its assumptions.
889331_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Advertising Costs : The company expenses advertising costs as incurred, which amounted to $1.9 million in 2011, $1.2 million in 2010 and $1.1 million in 2009, and are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.

889331_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	Costs incurred for shipping and handling of $5.9 million, $10.9 million, and $5.0 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses.
889331_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Restructuring Costs : The company incurred severance charges and plant closure expenses as part of the company s on-going cost reduction efforts.
889331_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	These charges are included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, or research and development expenses depending on the personnel being included in the charge.
889331_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	See Note 9 for additional information on restructuring costs.
889331_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Foreign Currency Translation : The company s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, as appropriate.
889331_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average rates.
889331_12_ITEM8_P66_S2	The amount of foreign currency conversion recognized in the income statement related to currency translation were losses of $0.9 million, $3.3 million and $0.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively and is included as a component of other expense (income), net.
889331_12_ITEM8_P66_S3	Adjustments from the translation process are recognized in Shareholders equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income.
889331_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	Stock-based Compensation : The company recognizes compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity compensation using a fair value method.
889331_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as both operating and financing cash flows.
889331_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	On certain occasions, the company has granted stock options for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price below that of the underlying stock on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense accordingly.
889331_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	This compensation expense has historically not been significant.
889331_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	See Note 13 for additional information on stock-based compensation.
889331_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Other Expense (Income), Net: Other expense (income), net consisting of interest income, royalties, non-operating income and foreign currency items, was $2.9 million of income in 2011 compared to $1.5 million of income in 2010.
889331_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	The year over year increase resulted primarily from dividend and royalty income.
889331_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Income Taxes: The company accounts for income taxes using the liability method.
889331_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
889331_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	The company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
889331_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889331_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Federal and state income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable.
889331_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Accounting Pronouncements : In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
889331_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	The new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.

889331_12_ITEM8_P72_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
889331_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements.
889331_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.

889331_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
889331_12_ITEM8_P74_S3	The guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
889331_12_ITEM8_P74_S4	In addition, the guidance does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.

889331_12_ITEM8_P118_S1	Fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
889331_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	Applicable accounting literature establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
889331_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	Applicable accounting literature defines levels within the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
889331_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable, such as pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques not based on market, exchange, dealer or broker-traded transactions.
889331_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy.
889331_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	Equity securities listed on a national market or exchange are valued at the last sales price.
889331_12_ITEM8_P122_S1	Such securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
889331_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	The fair values of commodity derivatives are valued based on quoted futures prices for the underlying commodity and are categorized as Level 2.
889331_12_ITEM8_P123_S1	The fair values of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets and are categorized as Level 2.
889331_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	The company does not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during 2011 or 2010.

889331_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	The company s other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and long-term debt.
889331_12_ITEM8_P127_S1	Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable approximate their fair values.
889331_12_ITEM8_P127_S2	The company s long-term debt fair value approximates book value at December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, respectively, as the long-term debt variable interest rates fluctuate along with market interest rates.
889331_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	During the period 2006 through 2009, the company announced closures of its facilities in Dundalk, Ireland, Irving, Texas, Des Plaines, Illinois, Elk Grove, Illinois, Matamoros, Mexico, Swindon, U.K., D nsen, Germany, Utrecht, Netherlands, and Yangmei, Taiwan.

889331_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	Management accrues for losses associated with litigation and environmental claims based on management's best estimate of future costs when such losses are probable and reasonably able to be estimated.
889331_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	Management, in conjunction with an independent third-party used to prepare an annual engineering study, performs an annual evaluation of the former coal mining operations in order to develop its estimate of their probable future obligations in regard to remediating the dangers (such as a shaft collapse) of abandoned coal mine shafts in the former coal mining operations.
889331_12_ITEM8_P133_S1	The ultimate determination can only be done after respective investigations because the concrete conditions are mostly unknown at this time.
889331_12_ITEM8_P133_S2	The accrual is not discounted as management cannot reasonably estimate when such remediation efforts will take place.

889331_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	The company s unvested share-based payment awards, such as certain performance shares, restricted shares and restricted share units that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends, meet the criteria of a participating security.
889331_12_ITEM8_P204_S1	The adoption changed the methodology of computing the company s earnings per share to the two-class method from the treasury stock method.
889331_12_ITEM8_P204_S2	This change has not affected previously reported earnings per share, consolidated net earnings or net cash flows from operations.
889331_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings are allocated between common stock and participating securities.
889331_12_ITEM8_P205_S1	The guidance provides that the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share is required only for each class of common stock and not for participating securities.
889331_12_ITEM8_P205_S2	As such, the company presents basic and diluted earnings per share for its one class of common stock.
889331_12_ITEM8_P206_S0	The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period.
889331_12_ITEM8_P206_S1	The company s reported net earnings is reduced by the amount allocated to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
889331_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	The dilutive effect of participating securities is calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.
889331_12_ITEM8_P207_S1	The company has determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.
889331_12_ITEM8_P207_S2	As such, the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per share calculation is adjusted for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders for calculating the diluted earnings per share.
889331_12_ITEM8_P208_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method:
889331_12_ITEM8_P209_S0	The following potential shares of common stock attributable to stock options were excluded from the earnings per share calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive: 85,563 in 2011; 77,729 in 2010; and 1,812,414 in 2009.
889331_12_ITEM8_P210_S0	The quarterly periods listed in the table below for 2011 are for the 13-weeks ending December 31, 2011, October 1, 2011, July 2, 2011 and April 2, 2011, respectively.
889331_12_ITEM8_P210_S1	The quarterly periods for 2010 are for the 13-weeks ending January 1, 2011, October 2, 2010, July 3, 2010 and April 3, 2010, respectively.

889331_12_ITEM8_P211_S1	The company also recorded a $1.7 million decrease to income tax expense related to a deferred tax asset write-up due to an increase in the statutory rate in China.
889331_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	b In the third quarter of 2011, the company recorded a $2.3 million charge related to asset impairments in Europe.
889331_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	c In the first quarter of 2011, the company recorded $3.7 million of non-cash charges related to the step-up of inventory from the Cole Hersee acquisition.

889331_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Their report appears on page 38 hereof.

889331_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

889331_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We invest heavily in research and development without knowing that we will recover these costs.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our competitors may develop products or technologies that will render our products non-competitive or obsolete.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A work stoppage could occur at certain of our facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, we may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of our suppliers.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A significant work stoppage, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The transfer of our manufacturing operations and changes in our distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:
889331_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect us.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for our products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or shortages is limited.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have multiple sources of supply for the majority of our commodity requirements.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs and the competitive position of our products and services.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P14_S7	For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Operations and supply sources located outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to greater risks.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our operating activities outside the United States contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the company to place our production in countries outside the United States, including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our international operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations, including risks relating to the following:
889331_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The success of these transactions depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these acquisitions.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Environmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes or in our finished goods.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Under these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	These releases or migrations may give rise to claims.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws and regulations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The risk of environmental remediation exists and the company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries, and we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries as well as the success of our customers products.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Net sales to the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	For example, the automotive industry as well as the consumer electronics market is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, the global automotive and electronic industries have overall manufacturing capacity far exceeding demand.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	To the extent that demand for certain of our customers products declines, the demand for our products may decline.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, interest rates or industry over-capacity may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, we could experience a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Fixed costs may reduce operating results if our sales fall below expectations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future sales.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The volatility of our stock price could affect the value of an investment in our stock and our future financial position.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The market price of our stock has fluctuated widely.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Between January 1, 2012 and December 29, 2012, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $43.81 and a high of $64.86, experiencing greater volatility over that time than the broader markets.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as general economic conditions, industry conditions, analysts expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under Our Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Also, we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our Information Technology ( IT ) systems could be breached.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We face certain security threats relating to the confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Despite implementation of security measures, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, cyber attacks and other unauthorized access and these security breaches could result in a disruption to our operations.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	A material network breach of our IT systems could involve the theft of intellectual property or customer data which may be used by competitors.
889331_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	To the extent that any security breach results in a loss or damage to data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, it could cause damage to our reputation, affect our customer relations, lead to claims against us, increase our costs to protect against future damage and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.

889331_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Littelfuse, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Littelfuse ) design, manufacture and sell circuit protection devices for use in the electronics, automotive and electrical markets throughout the world.
889331_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the company s Consolidated Financial Statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	The discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various business unit segments to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of Littelfuse as a whole.
889331_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) dictates annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers.
889331_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Within U.S. GAAP, an operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources.
889331_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	The CODM is the company s President and Chief Executive Officer.
889331_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	The company reports its operations by three business unit segments: Electronics, Automotive and Electrical.
889331_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The following table is a summary of the company s operating segments net sales by business unit and geography (in millions):
889331_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Sales by geography represent sales to customer or distributor locations.
889331_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Business unit segment information is described more fully in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following discussion provides an analysis of the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and for the three fiscal years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011.
889331_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales increased $2.9 million or less than 1% to $667.9 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to $665.0 million in fiscal year 2011 due primarily to an incremental $16.6 million from business acquisitions and growth in protection relays, custom mining products and automotive products, offset by lower electronics sales.
889331_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The company also experienced $9.4 million in unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily resulting from sales denominated in euros and, to a lesser extent, Canadian dollars and Korean won.
889331_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Excluding acquisitions and currency effects, net sales decreased $4.3 million or less than 1% year over year.
889331_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Automotive business segment sales increased $8.6 million or 4% to $206.2 million.
889331_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	The Electronics business segment sales decreased $25.0 million or 7% to $329.5 million, and the Electrical business segment sales increased $19.3 million or 17% to $132.2 million.
889331_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Sales levels in 2012, excluding acquisitions and currency effects, were negatively impacted by slowing demand for the company s electronics products coupled with channel inventory de-stocking.
889331_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Sales levels in 2011, excluding acquisitions and currency effects, were negatively impacted by slowing demand for the company s electronics products coupled with inventory de-stocking in the supply chain.
889331_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	The increase in Automotive sales was primarily due to an incremental $12.9 million in sales related to the Accel and Terra Power acquisitions in 2012 and organic growth in the passenger vehicle market.
889331_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	This was offset by a decline in commercial vehicle sales and unfavorable currency effects.
889331_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Lower commercial vehicle sales reflected weakness in the construction and heavy truck markets.
889331_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Currency effects reduced sales by $5.0 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the weaker euro.

889331_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Days sales outstanding (DSO) in accounts receivable was 58 days at year-end 2012 compared to 57 days at year-end 2011 and 58 days at year-end 2010 (excluding the year-end Cole Hersee balance).
889331_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	inventory outstanding was 69 days at year-end 2012, compared to 73 days at year-end 2011 and 70 days at year-end 2010 (excluding the year-end Cole Hersee balance).
889331_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.9 to 1 at year-end 2012, compared to 2.5 to 1 at year-end 2011 and 2.9 to 1 at year-end 2010.
889331_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The change in the current ratio at the end of 2012 compared to the prior year reflected increased current assets in 2012, primarily related to higher cash and cash equivalents balances.
889331_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The carrying amounts of total debt decreased $1.0 million in 2012, compared to an increase of $11.0 million in 2011 and an increase of $10.8 million in 2010.
889331_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	The decrease in 2012 is due to lower net amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility in 2012.
889331_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	The ratio of long-term debt to equity was 0.00 to 1 at year-end 2012 and 2011 and 0.09 to 1 at year-end 2010.
889331_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	Further information regarding the company s debt is provided in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The company started 2011 with $109.7 million of cash.
889331_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was approximately $120.8 million and included $87.0 million in net income and $39.6 million in non-cash adjustments (primarily $32.3 million in depreciation and amortization), partially offset by $5.8 million of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
889331_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2011 (including short-term and long-term items) that negatively impacted cash flows in 2011 consisted of decreases in accounts payable ($5.3 million), accrued expenses including post-retirement ($0.4 million), accrued payroll and severance ($3.2 million) and accrued taxes ($6.1 million).
889331_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The decrease in accounts payable resulted from decreased purchases related to low production levels at the end of 2011.
889331_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	The decrease in accrued payroll and severance resulted from lower severance accruals in 2011.
889331_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	Positively impacting cash flows were decreases in accounts receivable ($4.8 million), a decrease in inventory ($2.6 million) and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets ($1.8 million).
889331_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The company s capital expenditures were $22.5 million in 2012, $17.6 million in 2011 and $22.4 million in 2010.
889331_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The company expects capital expenditures in 2013 to increase to between $25 and $30 million primarily related to building expansion in Mexico to support the company s growth initiatives.
889331_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	The company expects to fund 2013 capital expenditures from operating cash flows.
889331_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the company s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2012 to April 30, 2013.
889331_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during 2012 under this program.
889331_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The company withheld 27,417 shares of stock in lieu of withholding taxes on behalf of employees who became vested in restricted stock option grants during 2012.
889331_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of December 29, 2012:
889331_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	As of December 29, 2012, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.
889331_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Specifically, the company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties; the company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and the company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets; and the company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
889331_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
889331_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	The new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity.
889331_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	The guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income, how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income.
889331_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
889331_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012, which resulted in a different presentation in its consolidated financial statements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on testing goodwill for impairment.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test).
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	The guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S4	In addition, the guidance does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S5	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S6	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S7	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_13_ITEM7_P63_S8	Goodwill testing was completed in September 2012 using the previous methodology, as permitted.
889331_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
889331_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment will have the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
889331_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
889331_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	The amendment is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM7_P64_S4	The company believes that adoption of the new guidance will have no effect on its consolidated financial statements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position.
889331_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	The company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results, as they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_13_ITEM7_P65_S5	The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs and competition.
889331_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in-transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse.
889331_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	All distributors are independent of the company.
889331_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers.
889331_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Volume Rebates: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	The company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life and quality issues.
889331_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Based on the analysis, the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting.
889331_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	This was approximately $0.6 million in 2012 for Accel and Selco, $0.4 million in 2011 for Selco and $3.7 million in 2010 for Cole Hersee.
889331_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The company has seven reporting units for goodwill testing purposes.
889331_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on September 30, 2012, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 66%, 113%, 59%, 99%, 96%, 247% and 119% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), automotive (excluding Cole Hersee), Cole Hersee, relay, custom products and fuse reporting units, respectively, at September 30, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 12.7% for all reporting units.
889331_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	A long-term growth rate of 3.0% was used for all seven reporting units.
889331_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at September 30, 2012 that showed either a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at September 30, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	The company evaluates long-lived asset groups on an ongoing basis.
889331_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Long-lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable.
889331_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
889331_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
889331_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	The company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results.
889331_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	The company recorded asset impairment charges of $0.5 million, $2.3 million and $3.0 million for the fiscal years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
889331_13_ITEM7_P91_S4	Further information regarding asset impairments is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	The company evaluates its investments quarterly or when there is an indicator of a potential impairment.
889331_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2012, company management determined that an indicator of impairment existed for the company s investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc.
889331_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	Subsequently, the company engaged a third party asset valuation firm to perform an analysis for purposes of assisting management in determining the amount of impairment.
889331_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	Further information regarding the impairment of the company s investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc. is provided in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure.
889331_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	The company evaluates its reserve for coal mine remediation annually utilizing a third party expert.
889331_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Littelfuse has a number of company-sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
889331_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	The company recognizes the full unfunded status of these plans on the balance sheet.
889331_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
889331_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_13_ITEM7_P97_S4	Further information regarding these plans is provided in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded for stock-option grants and restricted share units based upon the fair values of the awards.
889331_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
889331_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors.
889331_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options.
889331_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
889331_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to continue making cash dividend payments in the foreseeable future.
889331_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense was $7.3 million, $5.8 million and $5.2 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
889331_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	Further information regarding this expense is provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

889331_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
889331_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	The company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
889331_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889331_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Federal and state income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable.
889331_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
889331_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
889331_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	The company s 2012 revenue, excluding acquisitions ($16.6 million) and unfavorable currency effects ($9.4 million), was essentially flat compared to 2011 ($660.7 million in 2012 versus $665.0 million in 2011).
889331_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	The outlook for 2013 is guarded due to global economic uncertainty.
889331_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The electronics book-to-bill ratio is beginning to improve.
889331_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	Automotive passenger vehicle sales continue to be strong in Asia, solid in the U.S. and weak in Europe.
889331_13_ITEM7_P108_S3	The commercial vehicle market remains weak but has shown some early signs of improvement.
889331_13_ITEM7_P108_S4	Electrical continues to show solid performance in the powerfuse business.
889331_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	There is a world-wide slowdown in Potash mining which may impact the company s relay/custom business.

889331_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $25.0 to $30.0 million.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The company had $84.0 million in debt outstanding at December 29, 2012 related to the unsecured revolving credit facility, which is described in Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources .
889331_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While this debt has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%, the company s interest expense is not materially sensitive to changes in interest rate levels since debt levels and potential interest expense increases are insignificant relative to earnings.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The majority of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The company has manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Denmark, China, Lithuania, Taiwan and the Philippines.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	During 2012, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 67% of total net sales.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan and Taiwanese dollars.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company s most significant long exposure is to the euro, with lesser long exposures to the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Korean won.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The company s most significant short exposures are to the Mexican peso, Philippine peso and Chinese renminbi.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The company uses netting and offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures where possible and also, from time to time, utilizes derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures deemed to be material.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold and silver.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the company s earnings.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper, zinc, gold and silver, where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect annual pre-tax profit by approximately $1.9 million for copper, $0.7 million for zinc, $0.6 million for gold and $1.0 million for silver.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The cost of oil fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Consequently, there is a risk that a return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2013 could have a significant impact on the company s transportation and utility expenses.
889331_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	While the company is exposed to significant changes in certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, the company actively monitors these exposures and takes various actions to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

889331_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889331_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
889331_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
889331_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

889331_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Littelfuse, Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
889331_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
889331_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889331_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889331_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889331_13_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
889331_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889331_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889331_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
889331_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	In our opinion, Littelfuse, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.

889331_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Use of Estimates : The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes.
889331_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	The company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary.
889331_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
889331_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	Cash Equivalents : All highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
889331_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Short-Term and Long-Term Investments : The company has determined that certain of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
889331_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
889331_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in unrealized value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense (income), net.
889331_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
889331_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
889331_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments : The company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments and long-term debt.
889331_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	The carrying values of such financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
889331_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Accounts Receivable : The company performs credit evaluations of customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
889331_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based upon specific knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company.
889331_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Historically, credit losses have consistently been within management s expectations and have not been a material amount.
889331_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.
889331_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.
889331_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	The company also maintains allowances against accounts receivable for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers.
889331_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.
889331_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (first in, first out method), which approximates current replacement cost.
889331_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	The company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
889331_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Cost and Equity Method Investments/Investment in unconsolidated affiliate: Investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which the company has significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
889331_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	Investments in affiliates over which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method.
889331_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment : Land, buildings and equipment are carried at cost.
889331_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 21 years for buildings, seven to nine years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three years for computer equipment.
889331_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: The company annually tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at other dates if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	The company has seven reporting units for testing purposes.
889331_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_13_ITEM8_P36_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on September 30, 2012, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 66%, 113%, 59%, 99%, 96%, 247% and 119% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), automotive (excluding Cole Hersee), Cole Hersee, relay, custom products and fuse reporting units, respectively, at September 30, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 12.7% for all reporting units.
889331_13_ITEM8_P37_S3	A long-term growth rate of 3.0% was used for all seven reporting units.
889331_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at September 30, 2012 that showed a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at September 30, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Other Intangible Assets : Trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20 years.
889331_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of seven to 12 years.
889331_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of three to 20 years.
889331_13_ITEM8_P40_S3	Other intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause the asset to be impaired.
889331_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Environmental Liabilities : Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits : Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_13_ITEM8_P43_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company amended the Littelfuse Inc., Retirement Plan to allow participants who met certain requirements to elect to receive their vested retirement benefits in a lump sum on (or for certain participants annuity payments, on and after) December 1, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	This amendment resulted in a settlement charge of $5.1 million in 2012.
889331_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	See Note 13 for additional information.
889331_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Reclassifications: Certain items in the 2011 and 2010 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentations specifically, the 2011 presentation of the Investment in unconsolidated affiliate of $6.0 million has been separately presented.
889331_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	It was previously included as part of Other investments.
889331_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	These reclassifications had no impact on net income or shareholders equity for any period.
889331_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse, and all distributors are independent of the company.
889331_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	The company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers.
889331_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Volume Rebates: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_13_ITEM8_P62_S3	Accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be uncollectible, are written off against the reserve on a case-by-case basis.
889331_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

889331_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	The new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.
889331_13_ITEM8_P72_S2	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM8_P72_S3	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements.
889331_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity.
889331_13_ITEM8_P73_S2	The guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income, how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income.
889331_13_ITEM8_P73_S3	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.

889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test).
889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S3	The guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S4	In addition, the guidance does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.
889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S5	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S6	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S7	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_13_ITEM8_P74_S8	Goodwill testing was completed as of September 30, 2012 using the previous methodology, as permitted.
889331_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
889331_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment will have the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
889331_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
889331_13_ITEM8_P75_S3	The amendment is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
889331_13_ITEM8_P75_S4	The company believes that adoption of new guidance will have no effect on its consolidated financial statements.

889331_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	The company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
889331_13_ITEM8_P125_S1	The fair value is based upon either market quotes for actively traded instruments or independent bids for non-exchange traded instruments.
889331_13_ITEM8_P125_S2	The company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction.

889331_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	In determining fair value, the company uses various valuation approaches within the fair value measurement framework.
889331_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	Fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
889331_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	Applicable accounting literature establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
889331_13_ITEM8_P128_S1	Applicable accounting literature defines levels within the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
889331_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable, such as pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques not based on market, exchange, dealer or broker-traded transactions.
889331_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy.
889331_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	Equity securities listed on a national market or exchange are valued at the last sales price.
889331_13_ITEM8_P131_S1	Such securities are further detailed in Note 5 and classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
889331_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	and then an option pricing method to allocate the equity value to the various classes of stock in Shocking s capital structure, including Series C and common shares held by the company.
889331_13_ITEM8_P132_S1	Significant unobservable inputs used included an expected two years until liquidity event, a volatility of 35% and a risk free rate of 0.44%.

889331_13_ITEM8_P142_S1	The ultimate determination can only be done after respective investigations because the concrete conditions are mostly unknown at this time.
889331_13_ITEM8_P142_S2	The accrual is not discounted as management cannot reasonably estimate when such remediation efforts will take place.

889331_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	Regardless of whether the Executive has formally separated from service, the Executive will be considered to have separated from service as of the date it is reasonably anticipated that no further services will be performed by the Executive for the Company, or that the level of bona fide services the Executive will perform after such date will permanently decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period.

889331_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Executive shall submit to the Company satisfactory evidence of premium costs incurred within 30 days following the date such costs were incurred.
889331_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	Within 30 days following receipt of such evidence, the Company shall pay to the Executive such reimbursement, plus additional severance pay in an amount such that the net amount of such reimbursement and additional severance pay, after all applicable tax withholding, equals the difference between the full COBRA premium and the premium charged to active employees in Executive s peer group.
889331_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	Following the end of COBRA coverage, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the additional premium costs incurred by the Executive, in excess of the former employee COBRA rate for the Executive s peer group, for the purchase of an individual insurance policy providing medical coverage to the Executive and/or the Executive s family which is substantially similar to the coverage provided by the Company s group medical plan.

889331_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	Further information regarding the coal mine liability reserve is provided in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors we have identified below.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement the risk factors from time to time by other reports that we file with the SEC in the future.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our industry is subject to intense competitive pressures.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We compete on the basis of price, quality, service and/or brand name across the industries and markets we serve.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Competitive pressures could affect the prices we are able to charge our customers or the demand for our products.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We may not always be able to compete on price, particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than Littelfuse.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	As other companies enter our markets or develop new products, competition may further intensify.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers needs.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The end markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses on capital investments.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Furthermore, the life cycles of our products may change and are difficult to estimate.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our future success will depend upon our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers needs.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We invest heavily in research and development without knowing that we will recover these costs.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our competitors may develop products or technologies that will render our products non-competitive or obsolete.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A work stoppage could occur at certain of our facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, we may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of our suppliers.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A significant work stoppage, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The transfer of our manufacturing operations and changes in our distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:
889331_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect us.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for our products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or shortages is limited.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have multiple sources of supply for the majority of our commodity requirements.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs and the competitive position of our products and services.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Operations and supply sources located outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to greater risks.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our operating activities outside the United States contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the company to place our production in countries outside the United States, including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our international operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations, including risks relating to the following:
889331_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The success of these transactions depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these acquisitions.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Environmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes or in our finished goods.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Under these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	These releases or migrations may give rise to claims.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws and regulations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The risk of environmental remediation exists and the company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries, and we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries as well as the success of our customers products.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Net sales to the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	For example, the automotive industry as well as the consumer electronics market is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, the global automotive and electronic industries have overall manufacturing capacity far exceeding demand.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P29_S5	To the extent that demand for certain of our customers products declines, the demand for our products may decline.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, interest rates or industry over-capacity may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, we could experience a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Fixed costs may reduce operating results if our sales fall below expectations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future sales.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The volatility of our stock price could affect the value of an investment in our stock and our future financial position.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The market price of our stock has fluctuated widely.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Between December 30, 2012 and December 28, 2013, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $61.46 and a high of $94.26, experiencing greater volatility over that time than the broader markets.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as general economic conditions, industry conditions, analysts expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under Our Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Also, we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our Information Technology ( IT ) systems could be breached.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We face certain security threats relating to the confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Despite implementation of security measures, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, cyber attacks and other unauthorized access and these security breaches could result in a disruption to our operations.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	A material network breach of our IT systems could involve the theft of intellectual property or customer data which may be used by competitors.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	To the extent that any security breach results in a loss or damage to data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, it could cause damage to our reputation, affect our customer relations, lead to claims against us, increase our costs to protect against future damage and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Nevertheless, lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in our internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	On February 5, 2014, we reported that we had reached a determination to restate our previously-filed interim financial statements for the first quarter of 2013 and that our previously-filed interim financial statements for the first quarter of 2013 should not be relied upon.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We also reported, in the amendment to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2013, filed on a Form 10-Q/A on February 18, 2014, and in this Form 10-K, management s determination that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting at March 30, 2013 and December 28, 2013, respectively.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	These determinations relate to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to our evaluation of the income tax considerations, including deferred tax valuation allowances, relating to the write-off of our investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc. during the first quarter of 2013.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	As a result of the material weakness, management also concluded that both our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at March 30, 2013 and December 28, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Management has commenced steps to remediate the above material weakness associated with this misstatement and has begun the process of implementing an enhanced process to review and approve the income tax accounting treatment for any material items that are of an unusual or complex nature.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In accordance with our internal control over financial reporting compliance program, however, the material weakness designation cannot be remediated fully until the remediation processes have been operational for a period of time and successfully tested.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Such remediation is not anticipated to be complete until later in 2014.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	There can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not again exist.
889331_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties, judgments or losses not covered by insurance, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.

889331_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Introduction Littelfuse, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Littelfuse or we or our ) is the worldwide leader in circuit protection offering the industry's broadest and deepest portfolio of circuit protection products and solutions.
889331_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The company s devices protect products in virtually every market that uses electrical energy, from consumer electronics to automobiles to industrial equipment.
889331_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	The company conducts its business through three reportable segments, which are defined by markets and consist of Electronics, Automotive, and Electrical.
889331_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	The company s customer base includes original equipment manufacturers, tier one automotive suppliers and distributors.
889331_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	In addition to protecting and growing its core circuit protection business, Littelfuse has been investing in power control and sensing technologies.
889331_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	These newer platforms, combined with the company s strong balance sheet and operating cash flow, provide opportunities for increased organic and acquisition growth.
889331_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	The company has set a target to grow 15% per year; 5% organically and 10% through acquisitions.
889331_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	To maximize shareholder value, the company s primary strategic goals are to:
889331_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The company serves markets that are directly impacted by global economic trends with significant exposures to the consumer electronics, automotive, industrial and mining end markets.
889331_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The company s results will be impacted positively or negatively by changes in these end markets.
889331_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	In our Electronics segment (which accounts for about half of total Littelfuse sales), we experienced fourth quarter electronics sales of $95.2 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year quarter.
889331_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Full year sales were $367.1 million, an 11% increase.
889331_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Excluding acquisitions, fourth quarter electronic sales were down 7% sequentially, but were up 13% year-over-year.
889331_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Full year electronic sales, excluding acquisitions, increased 4%.
889331_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our fourth quarter sales are typically below third quarter levels as the Christmas build-up slows down.
889331_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	This year, however, the slowdown was a bit less than normal.
889331_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	In addition to the relative stability in the markets, another factor relates to the early Chinese New Year.
889331_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	so they could be in full production when the holiday season ends.
889331_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Channel inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were stable and in line with expected market conditions.
889331_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	When channel partners are concerned about end markets, we generally expect them to reduce inventory levels, particularly toward the end of the year.
889331_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	We believe that the fact that these channel partners inventory levels have remained steady is an indication of their belief in a stable to growth mode in 2014.
889331_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	In our Automotive segment, which was the strongest performing business segment in both the fourth quarter and for the full year (generating approximately a third of total Littelfuse sales), fourth quarter automotive sales of $72.9 million were up 45% from the same quarter last year.

889331_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Excluding acquisitions, 2013 sales were up 9%.
889331_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Fourth quarter automotive sales increased in all three geographies: Europe, Asia and the U.S.
889331_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Sales of passenger car fuses and Accel sensors have remained strong and we believe we are well positioned with high content on some of the best-selling models in today s market.
889331_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our fourth quarter results also benefited from an increase in commercial vehicle product sales compared to last year s weak fourth quarter.
889331_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	In our Electrical segment, electrical fuse sales were up 9% in the fourth quarter year over year due to continued growth in our focus areas of solar and HVAC, as well as incremental sales from distributor conversions during the year.
889331_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	For the full year, sales into the solar and HVAC markets increased more than $3.0 million over the prior year.
889331_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The non-residential construction market appears to be showing signs of improvement and industrial production activity remains solid, such that we expect the market outlook for the electrical fuse business to remain positive.
889331_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	In contrast, the custom electrical products business continues to struggle.
889331_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Although fourth quarter sales increased from what was a weak third quarter, they were still down substantially year over year.
889331_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The primary market for these products is Canadian potash mining, which has been severely impacted by declining margins and slower than expected demand growth.
889331_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Significant mine expansion projects that were expected to begin in 2013 and 2014 have been delayed.
889331_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	We do believe we are well positioned with Canadian potash producers for when mine investments rebound.
889331_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	On May 31, 2013, the company acquired 100% of Hamlin, Inc. ( Hamlin ) from Key Safety Systems, for $144.4 million (net of cash acquired).

889331_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	The guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
889331_14_ITEM7_P82_S4	In addition, the guidance does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.
889331_14_ITEM7_P82_S5	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
889331_14_ITEM7_P82_S6	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012.
889331_14_ITEM7_P82_S7	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_14_ITEM7_P82_S8	Goodwill testing was completed in September 2013 using the previous methodology, as permitted.
889331_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
889331_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment will have the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
889331_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
889331_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	The amendment is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
889331_14_ITEM7_P83_S4	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM7_P83_S5	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income or the balance sheet.
889331_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Under the new guidance, in addition to the presentation of changes in accumulated balances, an entity shall present separately for each component of other comprehensive income, current period reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and other amounts of current-period other comprehensive income.
889331_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	Both before-tax and net-of-tax presentations are permitted.
889331_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	The company believes the adoption of the new guidance will require additional disclosures but will have no significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.
889331_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements.
889331_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position.
889331_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	The company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results, as they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs and competition.
889331_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_14_ITEM7_P88_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in-transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse.
889331_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	All distributors are independent of the company.
889331_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Volume Rebates: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	The company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life and quality issues.
889331_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Based on the analysis, the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting.
889331_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	This was approximately $1.5 million for Hamlin in 2013, $0.6 million in 2012 for Accel and Selco and $0.4 million in 2011 for Selco.
889331_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	The company has eight reporting units for goodwill testing purposes.
889331_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_14_ITEM7_P105_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on September 29, 2013, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 61%, 97%, 67%, 158%, 42%, 57%, 244% and 151% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car, commercial vehicle products, sensors, relay, custom products and fuse reporting units, respectively, at September 29, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 12.5% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% used for all eight reporting units.
889331_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at September 29, 2013 that showed either a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at September 29, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	The company evaluates long-lived asset groups on an ongoing basis.
889331_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	Long-lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable.
889331_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
889331_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
889331_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	The company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results.
889331_14_ITEM7_P110_S3	The company recorded asset impairment charges of $0.0 million, $0.5 million and $2.3 million for the fiscal years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
889331_14_ITEM7_P110_S4	Further information regarding asset impairments is provided in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	The company evaluates its investments quarterly or when there is an indicator of a potential impairment.
889331_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2012, company management determined that an indicator of impairment existed for the company s investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc.
889331_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	Subsequently, the company engaged a third party asset valuation firm to perform an analysis for purposes of assisting management in determining the amount of impairment.
889331_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	Further information regarding the impairment of the company s investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc. is provided in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure.
889331_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_14_ITEM7_P112_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	The company evaluates its reserve for coal mine remediation annually utilizing a third party expert.
889331_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Littelfuse has a number of company-sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
889331_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	The company recognizes the full unfunded status of these plans on the balance sheet.
889331_14_ITEM7_P114_S2	Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
889331_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_14_ITEM7_P116_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_14_ITEM7_P116_S4	Further information regarding these plans is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded for stock-option grants and restricted share units based upon the fair values of the awards.
889331_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
889331_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors.
889331_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options.
889331_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
889331_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to continue making cash dividend payments in the foreseeable future.
889331_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense was $8.6 million, $7.3 million, and $5.8 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
889331_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	Further information regarding this expense is provided in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	The company accounts for income taxes using the liability method.
889331_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
889331_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	The company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
889331_14_ITEM7_P122_S2	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889331_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	Federal and state income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable.
889331_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	The company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
889331_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
889331_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	Overall, the company expects the first quarter of 2014 to look similar to the fourth quarter of 2013.
889331_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	SymCom is expected to contribute about $5.0 million in incremental sales in what for them is typically a seasonally weak quarter.
889331_14_ITEM7_P127_S1	However, the company expects the incremental sales from SymCom to be partially offset by lower custom sales reflecting continued weakness in the mining sector.
889331_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	Sales for the first quarter of 2014 are expected to be in the range of $195.0 to $205.0 million which, at the midpoint, represents 17% growth compared to the first quarter of 2013.
889331_14_ITEM7_P128_S1	Earnings for the first quarter of 2014 are expected to be in the range of $0.98 to $1.12 per diluted share.
889331_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	For the year 2014, the company expects moderate organic growth in both the Automotive and Electronics segments.
889331_14_ITEM7_P129_S1	In addition, a full year of sales for the recently-acquired Hamlin business will add to 2014 sales for both of these segments.
889331_14_ITEM7_P129_S2	The Electrical segment is expected to continue to be challenged by the global mining downturn and delays in the expansion plans of several major potash producers.
889331_14_ITEM7_P129_S3	This mining weakness is expected to be partially offset by moderate growth in the solar and industrial markets and the addition of SymCom.
889331_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	While typically the company s business model would enable earnings growth to exceed sales growth, the newly-acquired businesses, Hamlin and SymCom, are expected to operate below their margin potential for 2014.
889331_14_ITEM7_P130_S1	The company is making upfront investments to grow sales and to integrate these businesses, which it believes will contribute to earnings in 2015 and beyond.
889331_14_ITEM7_P130_S2	The company is also actively working on margin improvement plans for both these businesses.
889331_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	The company expects capital expenditures in 2014 to be in the range of $35 to $40 million primarily for capacity to support volume increases and new product introductions.
889331_14_ITEM7_P131_S1	The company expects to fund 2014 capital expansion from operating cash flows.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The company had $219.8 million in debt outstanding at December 28, 2013 related to the unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan, which is described in Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources .
889331_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While this debt has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%, the company s interest expense is not materially sensitive to changes in interest rate levels since debt levels and potential interest expense increases are insignificant relative to earnings.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The majority of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The company has manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Denmark, China, Lithuania, Taiwan and the Philippines.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	During 2013, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 64% of total net sales.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan and Taiwanese dollars.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company s most significant long exposure is to the euro, with lesser long exposures to the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Korean won.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The company s most significant short exposures are to the Mexican peso, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The company uses netting and offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures where possible and also, from time to time, utilizes derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures deemed to be material.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold and silver.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the company s earnings.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper, zinc, gold and silver, where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect annual pre-tax profit by approximately $2.0 million for copper, $0.6 million for zinc, $0.3 million for gold and $0.5 million for silver.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The cost of oil fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Consequently, there is a risk that a return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2014 could have a significant impact on the company s transportation and utility expenses.
889331_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the company is exposed to significant changes in certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, the company actively monitors these exposures and takes various actions to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.
889331_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Littelfuse, Inc.
889331_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Littelfuse, Inc., as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of net income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2013.

889331_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have audited Littelfuse, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
889331_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	Littelfuse, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
889331_14_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
889331_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889331_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889331_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889331_14_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
889331_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889331_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889331_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
889331_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Hamlin, Inc., and subsidiaries, which are included in the 2013 consolidated financial statements of Littelfuse, Inc., and constituted approximately 18.3% of total assets as of December 28, 2013, approximately 6.7% of total revenue and approximately 1.9% of consolidated operating income for the year then ended.
889331_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Littelfuse, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Hamlin, Inc., and subsidiaries.
889331_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
889331_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment: A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to the company s evaluation of the income tax considerations, including deferred tax valuation allowances, relating to the write-off of its investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc. during the first quarter of 2013.
889331_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Littelfuse, Inc., has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.
889331_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Littelfuse, Inc., as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2013 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 25, 2014, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

889331_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Use of Estimates : The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes.
889331_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	The company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary.

889331_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash Equivalents : All highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
889331_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Short-Term and Long-Term Investments : The company has determined that certain of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
889331_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
889331_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in unrealized value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense (income), net.
889331_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
889331_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
889331_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments : The company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments and long-term debt.
889331_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	The carrying values of such financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
889331_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Accounts Receivable : The company performs credit evaluations of customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
889331_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based upon specific knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company.
889331_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Historically, credit losses have consistently been within management s expectations and have not been a material amount.
889331_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.
889331_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.
889331_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	The company also maintains allowances against accounts receivable for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers.
889331_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.
889331_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (first in, first out method), which approximates current replacement cost.
889331_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	The company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
889331_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate: Investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which the company has significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
889331_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	Investments in affiliates over which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method.
889331_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment : Land, buildings and equipment are carried at cost.
889331_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 21 years for buildings, seven to nine years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three years for computer equipment.
889331_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: The company annually tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at other dates if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	The company has eight reporting units for testing purposes.
889331_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_14_ITEM8_P38_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	As of the most recent annual test, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 61%, 97%, 67%, 158%, 42%, 57%, 244% and 151% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car, commercial vehicle products, sensors, relay, custom products and fuse reporting units, respectively, at September 29, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 12.5% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% was used for all eight reporting units.
889331_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test that showed a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	Other Intangible Assets : Trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20 years.
889331_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of seven to 12 years.
889331_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of three to 20 years.
889331_14_ITEM8_P42_S3	Other intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause the asset to be impaired.
889331_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Environmental Liabilities : Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_14_ITEM8_P43_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits : Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company amended the Littelfuse Inc., Retirement Plan to allow participants who met certain requirements to elect to receive their vested retirement benefits in a lump sum on (or for certain participants annuity payments, on and after) December 1, 2012.
889331_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	This amendment resulted in a settlement charge of $5.1 million in 2012.
889331_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	See Note 12 for additional information.
889331_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Reclassifications: Certain items in the 2012 and 2011 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentations specifically, the 2012 and 2011 presentation of the Foreign exchange (gain) or loss of $3.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively has been separately presented.
889331_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	This was previously included as part of Other expense (income), net.
889331_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	These reclassifications had no impact on net income or shareholders equity for any period.
889331_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_14_ITEM8_P48_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	The company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists.
889331_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Specifically, the company meets those requirements because:
889331_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	The company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale.
889331_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	The company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company.
889331_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	The company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product.
889331_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	The risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft, physical destruction or damage of the product.
889331_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	The company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for FOB destination sales.
889331_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by Littelfuse, and all distributors are independent of the company.
889331_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	The company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers.
889331_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	The company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns.
889331_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Volume Rebates: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_14_ITEM8_P63_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_14_ITEM8_P64_S3	Accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be uncollectible, are written off against the reserve on a case-by-case basis.
889331_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	However, due to the company s diverse customer base and lack of credit concentration, the company does not believe its estimates would be materially impacted by changes in its assumptions.
889331_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Advertising Costs : The company expenses advertising costs as incurred, which amounted to $1.6 million in 2013, $1.7 million in 2012 and $1.9 million in 2011, and are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.

889331_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Foreign Currency Translation : The company s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, as appropriate.
889331_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average rates.
889331_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	The amount of foreign currency conversion recognized in the income statement related to currency translation was income of $5.2 million in 2013 and losses of $8.5 million and $0.9 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
889331_14_ITEM8_P68_S3	Adjustments from the translation process are recognized in Shareholders equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income.

889331_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Accounting Pronouncements : In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
889331_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	The new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.
889331_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012.
889331_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements.
889331_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity.
889331_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	The guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income, how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income.
889331_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
889331_14_ITEM8_P74_S4	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012, which resulted in a different presentation in its consolidated financial statements.

889331_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test).
889331_14_ITEM8_P75_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
889331_14_ITEM8_P75_S3	The guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
889331_14_ITEM8_P75_S4	In addition, the guidance does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.
889331_14_ITEM8_P75_S5	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.

889331_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
889331_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment will have the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
889331_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
889331_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	The amendment is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
889331_14_ITEM8_P76_S4	The company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2012.
889331_14_ITEM8_P76_S5	There was no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income or the balance sheet.
889331_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	Under the new guidance, in addition to the presentation of changes in accumulated balances, an entity shall present separately for each component of other comprehensive income, current period reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and other amounts of current-period other comprehensive income.
889331_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	Both before-tax and net-of-tax presentations are permitted.
889331_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
889331_14_ITEM8_P77_S4	The company believes the adoption of the new guidance will require additional disclosures but will have no significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

889331_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Littelfuse internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

889331_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC we have excluded Hamlin from our assessment of our control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013.

889331_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Based on this assessment, the company s management concluded that, as of December 28, 2013, the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to the material weakness noted below:
889331_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to the company s evaluation of the income tax considerations, including deferred tax valuation allowances, relating to the write-off of its investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc. during the first quarter of 2013.

889331_14_ITEM9A_P10_S1	In accordance with the company s internal control over financial reporting compliance program, however, the material weakness designation cannot be remediated fully until the remediation processes have been operational for a period of time and successfully tested.

889331_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs and the competitive position of our products and services.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

889331_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing.

889331_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules, unexpected product recalls or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	For example, the automotive industry as well as the consumer electronics market is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In addition, the global automotive and electronic industries have overall manufacturing capacity far exceeding demand.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P35_S5	To the extent that demand for certain of our customers products declines, the demand for our products may decline.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, interest rates or industry over-capacity may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, we could experience a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

889331_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future sales.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

889331_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The market price of our stock has fluctuated widely.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Between December 28, 2013 and December 27, 2014, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $78.68 and a high of $100.82, experiencing greater volatility over that time than the broader markets.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as general economic conditions, industry conditions, analysts expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under Our Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Also, we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our Information Technology ( IT ) systems could be breached.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We face certain security threats relating to the confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Despite implementation of security measures, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, cyber attacks and other unauthorized access and these security breaches could result in a disruption to our operations.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	A material network breach of our IT systems could involve the theft of intellectual property or customer data which may be used by competitors.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	To the extent that any security breach results in a loss or damage to data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, it could cause damage to our reputation, affect our customer relations, lead to claims against us, increase our costs to protect against future damage and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Nevertheless, lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in our internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	On February 4, 2014, management determined that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	This determination relates to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to our evaluation of the income tax considerations, including deferred tax valuation allowances, relating to the write-off of our investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc. during the first quarter of 2013.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As a result of the material weakness, management also concluded that both our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at March 30, 2013 and December 28, 2013.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	In accordance with our internal control over financial reporting compliance program, we successfully implemented additional controls over tax accounting.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The controls were in effect for all quarterly reporting periods during 2014 and at December 27, 2014.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Management has concluded that the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to taxes, as described above, has been effectively remediated.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	There can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not again exist.
889331_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties, judgments or losses not covered by insurance, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.

889331_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Introduction Littelfuse, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Littelfuse or we or our ) is the worldwide leader in circuit protection offering the industry s broadest and deepest portfolio of circuit protection products and solutions.
889331_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The company s devices protect products in virtually every market that uses electrical energy, from consumer electronics to automobiles to industrial equipment.
889331_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	The company conducts its business through three reportable segments, which are defined by markets and consist of Electronics, Automotive, and Electrical.
889331_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	The company s customer base includes original equipment manufacturers, tier one automotive suppliers and distributors.
889331_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	In addition to protecting and growing its core circuit protection business, Littelfuse has been investing in power control and sensing technologies.
889331_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	These newer platforms, combined with the company s strong balance sheet and operating cash flow, provide opportunities for increased organic and acquisition growth.
889331_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	In 2012, the company set a five-year strategic target plan to grow annual sales at 15% per year; 5% organically and 10% through acquisitions.
889331_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	As of December 27, 2014, two years into the five-year plan, the company has achieved an annual sales growth of 13%; 5% organically and 8% through acquisitions.
889331_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	The company remains focused on only those acquisitions that will add shareholder value.
889331_15_ITEM7_P1_S5	Overall, the company believes its strategy is sound, the fundamentals of its business have not changed, and its long-term goals are achievable.
889331_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	To maximize shareholder value, the company s primary strategic goals are to:
889331_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The company serves markets that are directly impacted by global economic trends with significant exposures to the consumer electronics, automotive, industrial and mining end markets.
889331_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The company s results will be impacted positively or negatively by changes in these end markets.
889331_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Electronics Segment Overview The Electronics segment, which accounts for 48% of total sales, has produced solid revenue growth and substantial margin improvement over the last few years.
889331_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	In 2014, sales increased 12% (7% excluding acquisitions) and operating margin increased from 19.0% to 21.2% reflecting growth in all regions.
889331_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	The company believe this is the result of a stable electronics market combined with ongoing design wins and market share gains for Littelfuse.
889331_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	The electronics business is affected by seasonality.
889331_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Sales are typically weaker in the first and fourth quarters and stronger in the second quarter and third quarters.
889331_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	This reflects the production ramp up for consumer electronics in advance of the year-end holidays and other factors.
889331_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Fourth quarter 2014 sales for Electronics were consistent with normal seasonality as channel inventories remain at appropriate levels.
889331_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	The book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 (1.0 excluding sensors) at the end of the fourth quarter is also consistent with normal seasonal trends .
889331_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Automotive segment, which accounts for 38% of sales, has been the company s fastest growing business over the last few years.
889331_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Passenger car fuse sales continue to outperform global car production due primarily to the success of the company s new high current fuses which are driving increases in content per vehicle.
889331_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Commercial vehicle products had their best year ever with double-digit sales growth and improved operating margin driven by strength in the North American heavy duty truck market and integration-related cost savings.
889331_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Automotive sensors also had their second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth primarily reflecting ramp-up of new solar sensor and speed and position sensor platforms.
889331_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	In summary, sales increased in all three major areas of the Automotive business, and while the company is currently experiencing headwinds from the weaker euro, it anticipates continued growth in the year ahead.
889331_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Electrical segment, which accounts for about 14% of total sales, has been the company s most challenging segment for the past two years.
889331_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	In 2014, Electrical sales declined 6% (22% excluding the acquisition of SymCom) reflecting the depressed global mining market, a difficult year for solar sales and continued weakness in non-residential construction.
889331_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Toward the end of 2014, the company began seeing signs of improvement in two of its most important end markets: potash mining and non-residential construction.
889331_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	While these positive trends did not significantly impact 2014, the company expects these trends to contribute to growth in 2015.
889331_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	In addition, the company expects improved performance for SymCom in 2015 reflecting new product introductions and progress on integration activities.
889331_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	On January 3, 2014, the company acquired 100% of SymCom, Inc. ( SymCom ) for $52.8 million (net of cash acquired).
889331_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Located in Rapid City, South Dakota, SymCom provides overload relays and pump controllers primarily to the industrial market.
889331_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The acquisition allows the company to strengthen its position in the relay products market by adding new products and new customers within its Electrical business unit segment.
889331_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	On May 31, 2013, the company acquired 100% of Hamlin, Inc. ( Hamlin ) from Key Safety Systems, for $144.4 million (net of cash acquired).
889331_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Hamlin is a manufacturer of sensor technology providing standard products and custom solutions for leading global manufacturers in the automotive and electronic industries.
889331_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The acquisition allows the company to expand its automotive and electronics product offerings in the global sensor market in both the Automotive and Electronics business segments.
889331_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principl e s ( GAAP ) dictates annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers.
889331_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Within U.S. GAAP, an operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources.

889331_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Fiscal year 2014 also included $3.9 million in foreign currency losses primarily attributable to changes in the value of both the euro and Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar while fiscal year 2013 included $3.3 million in foreign currency gains primarily related to the value of the Philippine peso against the dollar.
889331_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net sales increased $94.1 million or 12% to $852.0 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $757.9 million in fiscal year 2013 due primarily to an incremental $56.1 million from business acquisitions and growth in electronic and automotive products, offset by lower electrical sales.
889331_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The company also experienced $0.4 million in unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulting from sales denominated in Canadian dollars and Japanese yen.
889331_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2014, sales were negatively impacted by the steep decline in the euro.
889331_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	Excluding acquisitions and currency effects, net sales increased $38.5 million or 5% year over year.
889331_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	The Automotive business segment sales increased $58.2 million or 22% to $325.4 million.
889331_15_ITEM7_P20_S5	The Electronics business segment sales increased $43.0 million or 12% to $410.1 million, and the Electrical business segment sales decreased $7.1 million or 6% to $116.5 million.
889331_15_ITEM7_P20_S6	automotive and electronic products partially offset by slowing demand for the company s electrical products.
889331_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The increase in Automotive sales was primarily due to strong organic growth in all product categories and an incremental $20.2 million in sales from Hamlin.
889331_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Currency effects increased sales by $0.6 million for the full year 2014 compared to 2013.
889331_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Excluding incremental sales from Hamlin and currency effects, Automotive sales increased $37.3 million or 14% year over year due primarily to increases in content per vehicle and strength in the heavy truck market.
889331_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The increase in Electronics sales reflected solid growth for both semiconductor and passive components and incremental sales from Hamlin of $16.3 million.
889331_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition, sales were positively impacted by net favorable currency effects of $0.2 million for the full year 2014.

889331_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	The company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
889331_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended prior authoritative guidance for revenue recognition which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.
889331_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	The standard is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889331_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards.
889331_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	The company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements.
889331_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income or the balance sheet.
889331_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Under the new guidance, in addition to the presentation of changes in accumulated balances, an entity shall present separately for each component of other comprehensive income, significant current period reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and other amounts of current-period other comprehensive income.
889331_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	Both before-tax and net-of-tax presentations are permitted.

889331_15_ITEM7_P75_S5	There was no significant effect on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889331_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements.
889331_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position.
889331_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_15_ITEM7_P76_S4	The company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results, as they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_15_ITEM7_P76_S5	The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	This generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs and competition.
889331_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Volume Rebates : The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	The company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life and quality issues.
889331_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Based on the analysis, the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting.
889331_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	This was approximately $2.8 million for SymCom in 2014, $1.5 million for Hamlin in 2013 and $0.6 million in 2012 for Accel and Selco.
889331_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	The company has eight reporting units for goodwill testing purposes.
889331_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on September 27, 2014, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 114%, 128%, 128%, 190%, 26%, 6%, 82% and 83% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car, commercial vehicle products, sensors, relays, custom products and fuse reporting units, respectively, at September 27, 2014.
889331_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 11.8% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% was used for all reporting units except for relay which had a discount rate of 12.8% as a result of a 1.0% premium factor.
889331_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at September 27, 2014 that showed either a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at September 27, 2014.
889331_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	The company evaluates long-lived asset groups on an ongoing basis.
889331_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	Long-lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable.
889331_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
889331_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
889331_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	The company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results.
889331_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	The company recorded asset impairment charges of $0.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
889331_15_ITEM7_P93_S4	Further information regarding asset impairments is provided in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	The company evaluates its investments quarterly or when there is an indicator of a potential impairment.
889331_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2012, company management determined that an indicator of impairment existed for the company s investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc.
889331_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Subsequently, the company engaged a third party asset valuation firm to perform an analysis for purposes of assisting management in determining the amount of impairment.
889331_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	Further information regarding the impairment of the company s investment in Shocking Technologies, Inc. is provided in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure.
889331_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	Costs related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	The company evaluates its reserve for coal mine remediation annually utilizing a third party expert.
889331_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Littelfuse has a number of company-sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
889331_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	The company recognizes the full unfunded status of these plans on the balance sheet.
889331_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
889331_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_15_ITEM7_P99_S4	Further information regarding these plans is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	Equity-based compensation expense is recorded for stock-option awards and restricted share units based upon the fair values of the awards.
889331_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	The fair value of stock-option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
889331_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors.
889331_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options.
889331_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
889331_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	The company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to continue making cash dividend payments in the foreseeable future.

889331_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889331_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Federal and state income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable.
889331_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	The company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
889331_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
889331_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Sales for the first quarter of 2015 are expected to be in the range of $202.0 to $212.0 million which represents flat revenue at the midpoint compared to the prior year after currency effects (approximately 4% growth in constant currency).
889331_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	Earnings for the first quarter of 2015 are expected to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.14 per diluted share.

889331_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While this debt has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%, the company s interest expense is not materially sensitive to changes in interest rate levels since debt levels and potential interest expense increases are insignificant relative to earnings.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The majority of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The company has manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Denmark, China, Lithuania and the Philippines.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	During 2014, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 63% of total net sales.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan and Taiwanese dollars.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company s most significant long exposure is to the euro, with lesser long exposures to the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Korean won.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The company s most significant short exposures are to the Mexican peso, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The company uses netting and offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures where possible and also, from time to time, utilizes derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures deemed to be material.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold and silver.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the company s earnings.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper, zinc, gold and silver, where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect annual pre-tax profit by approximately $1.5 million for copper, $0.7 million for zinc, $0.3 million for gold and $0.9 million for silver.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The cost of oil fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Consequently, there is a risk that a return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2015 could have a significant impact on the company s transportation and utility expenses.
889331_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the company is exposed to significant changes in certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, the company actively monitors these exposures and takes various actions to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 27, 2014, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
889331_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

889331_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889331_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

889331_15_ITEM8_P13_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
889331_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889331_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889331_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889331_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Use of Estimates : The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes.
889331_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	The company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary.
889331_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
889331_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cash Equivalents : All highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
889331_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Short-Term and Long-Term Investments : The company has determined that certain of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
889331_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
889331_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in unrealized value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense (income), net.
889331_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
889331_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
889331_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Short-term investments, which are primarily certificates of deposits, are carried at cost which approximates fair value.
889331_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments : The company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments and long-term debt.
889331_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	The carrying values of such financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
889331_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Accounts Receivable : The company performs credit evaluations of customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
889331_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based upon specific knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company.
889331_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Historically, credit losses have consistently been within management s expectations and have not been a material amount.
889331_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.
889331_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.
889331_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	The company also maintains allowances against accounts receivable for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers.
889331_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.
889331_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (first in, first out method), which approximates current replacement cost.
889331_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
889331_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate : Investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which the company has significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
889331_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Investments in affiliates over which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method.
889331_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment : Land, buildings and equipment are carried at cost.
889331_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 21 years for buildings, seven to nine years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three years for computer equipment.
889331_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: The company annually tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at other dates if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The company has eight reporting units for testing purposes.
889331_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	As of the most recent annual test, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 114%, 128%, 128%, 190%, 26%, 6%, 82% and 83% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car, commercial vehicle products, sensors, relay, custom products and fuse reporting units, respectively, at September 30, 2014.
889331_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 11.8% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% was used for all reporting units except for relay which had a discount rate of 12.8% as a result of a 1.0% premium factor.
889331_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test that showed a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Other Intangible Assets : Trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20 years.
889331_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of seven to 12 years.
889331_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of three to 20 years.
889331_15_ITEM8_P46_S3	Other intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause the asset to be impaired.
889331_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Environmental Liabilities : Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits : Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_15_ITEM8_P49_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company amended the Littelfuse Inc., Retirement Plan to allow participants who met certain requirements to elect to receive their vested retirement benefits in a lump sum on (or for certain participants annuity payments, on and after) December 1, 2012.
889331_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	This amendment resulted in a settlement charge of $5.1 million in 2012.
889331_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	See Note 12 for additional information.
889331_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Certain amounts presented in the 2013 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation - specifically a reclassification was made to the company s intangible asset categories between Distribution network and Customer lists, trademarks and tradenames.
889331_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	This reclassification had no impact on total intangibles, net income or shareholders equity for any period.
889331_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	This generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs and competition.
889331_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_15_ITEM8_P55_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Volume Rebates : The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	Accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be uncollectible, are written off against the reserve on a case-by-case basis.
889331_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

889331_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	On the date the derivative is entered into, the company designates the derivative as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge, and accounts for the derivative in accordance with its designation.
889331_15_ITEM8_P118_S2	The company also formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.

889331_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	In determining fair value, the company uses various valuation approaches within the fair value measurement framework.
889331_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	Fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
889331_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	The company currently does not have any outstanding derivative instruments.
889331_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	Applicable accounting literature establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
889331_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	Applicable accounting literature defines levels within the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
889331_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets, such as dealer or broker markets; and Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable, such as pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques not based on market, exchange, dealer or broker-traded transactions.
889331_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy.

889331_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	These newer platforms, combined with the company s strong balance sheet and operating cash flow, provide opportunities for increased organic and acquisition growth.
889331_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	In 2012, the company set a five-year strategic target plan to grow annual sales at 15% per year; 5% organically and 10% through acquisitions.
889331_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	As of January 2, 2016, three years into the five-year plan, the company has achieved an annual sales growth of 9%; 4% organically and 5% through acquisitions.
889331_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	In November, 2015, the company announced its planned acquisition of TE Connectivity s circuit protection devices business ( CPD ) which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016.
889331_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The company believes that the pending acquisition of the CPD business in 2016 puts the company on track with the five-year growth targets set in 2012 as described above.
889331_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The company remains focused on only those acquisitions that will add shareholder value.
889331_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Overall, the company believes its strategy is sound, the fundamentals of its business have not changed, and its long-term goals are achievable.
889331_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	To maximize shareholder value, the company s primary strategic goals are to:
889331_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The company serves markets that are directly impacted by global economic trends with significant exposures to the consumer electronics, automotive, industrial and mining end markets.
889331_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	The company s results will be impacted positively or negatively by changes in these end markets.
889331_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Electronics Segment Overview The Electronics segment, which accounted for approximately 47% of total sales in 2015, has produced modest revenue growth and strong operating margins over the last few years.
889331_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	In 2015, sales decreased 1% (a 2% increase excluding currency effects) and operating margins were 19.0% for 2015 as compared to 21.2% in 2014.
889331_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Strong sales in both Europe and China helped to offset continued adjustments in channel inventory and capacity constraints for electronic sensor products as the company continues to transfer production to the Philippines.
889331_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	The company believes the revenue growth is the result of a stable electronics market combined with ongoing design wins and market share gains for Littelfuse.
889331_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The electronics business is affected by seasonality.
889331_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Sales are typically weaker in the first and fourth quarters and stronger in the second quarter and third quarters.
889331_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	This reflects the production ramp-up for consumer electronics in advance of the year-end holidays and other factors.
889331_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Fourth quarter 2015 sales for Electronics were consistent with normal seasonality as channel inventories remain at appropriate levels.
889331_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	at the end of the fourth quarter is also consistent with normal seasonal trends .
889331_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Automotive segment, which accounted for approximately 39% of sales in 2015, has been the company s fastest growing business over the last few years.
889331_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	In 2015, Automotive sales increased 4% (11% excluding currency effects) primarily resulting from a strong performance in automotive sensor sales which increased 20% over the prior year.
889331_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Passenger car fuse sales continue to outperform global car production due primarily to the success of the company s new high current fuses which are driving increases in content per vehicle.
889331_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Automotive sensors also had its third consecutive year of double-digit sales growth primarily reflecting ramp-up of new solar sensor and speed and position sensor platforms.
889331_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	The company continues to make good progress on its objective to improve sensor margins by growing the business and replacing low margin legacy business with more profitable design wins.
889331_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	In summary, 2015 was a record year for the Automotive segment.
889331_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Growth in fuse content was driven by more sophisticated electronics in vehicles and sales of our high-current products, especially the Masterfuse TM line.
889331_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our automotive sensor business had an excellent year, with strong growth in sales and a significant improvement in margins.
889331_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	For the CVP business, the main contributor to sales was the North American heavy duty truck market.
889331_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Industrial Segment Overview The Industrial segment, which accounted for approximately 14% of total sales in 2015, experienced an improved performance in 2015 with sales increasing 5% (9% excluding currency effects) over the prior year with strong sales in power fuses and continued improvement in the custom business more than offsetting a decline in relay sales.
889331_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in fuse sales was due to continuing strength in the solar market, as well as distributors increasing purchases after working down inventories in response to the weak end markets.
889331_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Within the custom business, the company has diversified its portfolio beyond the potash market and into e-houses used in the heavy industrial and utility markets.
889331_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	In summary, 2015 was a good year for the Industrial segment overall.
889331_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The business saw a rebound in electrical fuse sales and margins, with fuse sales into the solar market almost doubling.
889331_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	It also made progress in diversifying the custom products and relay businesses beyond potash mining.

889331_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards.
889331_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	The company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements.
889331_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements.
889331_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position.
889331_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_16_ITEM7_P83_S3	Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_16_ITEM7_P83_S4	The company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results, as they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_16_ITEM7_P83_S5	The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	This generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs and competition.

889331_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.

889331_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	The company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life and quality issues.
889331_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	Based on the analysis, the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	During 2014, the company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting.
889331_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	This step-up was approximately $2.8 million for SymCom in 2014.
889331_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	The company has eight reporting units for goodwill testing purposes.
889331_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_16_ITEM7_P95_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on September 27, 2015, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 148%, 95%, 188%, 218%, 76%, 26%, 12% and 198% for its reporting units; electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car, commercial vehicle products, sensors, relays, custom products and power fuse, respectively, at September 27, 2015.
889331_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 11.7% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% which were used for all reporting units except for automotive sensor and relay which had a discount rate of 13.7% as a result of a 2.0% premium factor and custom products which had a discount rate of 14.7% as a result of a 3.0% premium factor.
889331_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at September 27, 2015 that showed either a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at September 27, 2015.
889331_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	The company evaluates long-lived asset groups on an ongoing basis.
889331_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	Long-lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable.
889331_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
889331_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
889331_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	The company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results.
889331_16_ITEM7_P100_S3	The company recorded asset impairment charges of $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.0 million for the fiscal years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
889331_16_ITEM7_P100_S4	Further information regarding asset impairments is provided in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
889331_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure.

889331_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_16_ITEM7_P105_S4	During 2015, the company settled its U.S. defined benefit pension plan as described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

889331_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	The fair value of stock-option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
889331_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors.
889331_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options.

889331_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	Despite concerns about the global economy and weakness in some of its end markets, the company believes it can grow revenue in the low to mid single digits in 2016.
889331_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	Assuming modest top-line growth, the company believes it can expand its operating margin by approximately 150 basis points compared to 2015 as it benefits from completion of its footprint consolidation projects, further progress on automotive sensor profitability initiatives and continued gains in manufacturing performance.

889331_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The company had $162.0 million in debt outstanding at January 2, 2016 related to the unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan which are described in Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources .
889331_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	While this debt has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.25%, the company s interest expense is not materially sensitive to changes in interest rate levels since debt levels and potential interest expense increases are insignificant relative to earnings.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The majority of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company has manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Denmark, China, Italy, Lithuania and the Philippines.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	During 2015, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 60% of total net sales.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan and Taiwanese dollars.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The company s most significant net long exposure is to the euro.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The company s most significant net short exposures are to the Chinese yuan, Mexican peso and Philippine peso.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P4_S4	The company uses netting and offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures where possible and also, from time to time, utilizes derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures deemed to be material.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold and silver.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the company s earnings.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper, zinc, gold and silver, where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect annual pre-tax profit by approximately $1.6 million for copper, $0.6 million for zinc, $0.2 million for gold and $0.6 million for silver.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The cost of oil has fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Consequently, there is a risk that a return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2016 could have a significant impact on the company s transportation and utility expenses.
889331_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	While the company is exposed to significant changes in certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, the company actively monitors these exposures and takes various actions to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

889331_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
889331_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
889331_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889331_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

889331_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
889331_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889331_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889331_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889331_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Use of Estimates : The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes.
889331_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	The company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary.
889331_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
889331_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Cash Equivalents : All highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
889331_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Short-Term and Long-Term Investments : The company has determined that certain of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.
889331_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
889331_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Realized gains and losses and declines in unrealized value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense (income), net.

889331_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
889331_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Short-term investments, which are primarily certificates of deposits, are carried at cost which approximates fair value.
889331_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments : The company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments and long-term debt.
889331_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	The carrying values of such financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
889331_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Accounts Receivable : The company performs credit evaluations of customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
889331_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based upon specific knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company.
889331_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Historically, credit losses have consistently been within management s expectations and have not been a material amount.
889331_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.
889331_16_ITEM8_P38_S2	Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.
889331_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	The company also maintains allowances against accounts receivable for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers.
889331_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.
889331_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (first in, first out method), which approximates current replacement cost.
889331_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	The company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
889331_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate : Investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which the company has significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
889331_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Investments in affiliates over which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method.
889331_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment : Land, buildings and equipment are carried at cost.
889331_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 21 years for buildings, seven to nine years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three years for computer equipment.
889331_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: The company annually tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at other dates if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	The company has eight reporting units for testing purposes.
889331_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on September 27, 2015, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Specifically, the company noted that its headroom, defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 148%, 95%, 188%, 218%, 76%, 26%, 12% and 198% for its electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car products, commercial vehicle products, automotive sensor products, relay, custom and power fuse reporting units, respectively, at September 27, 2015.
889331_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 11.7% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% which were used for all reporting units except for automotive sensor and relay which had a discount rate of 13.7% as a result of a 2.0% premium factor and custom products which had a discount rate of 14.7% as a result of a 3.0% premium factor.
889331_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at September 27, 2015 that showed a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at September 27, 2015.
889331_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain impairment conditions exist.
889331_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Other Intangible Assets : Trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20 years.
889331_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of seven to 17 years.
889331_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of three to 20 years.
889331_16_ITEM8_P48_S3	Other intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause the asset to be impaired.
889331_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Environmental Liabilities : Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits : Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_16_ITEM8_P50_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_16_ITEM8_P51_S4	During 2015, the company terminated the U.S. defined benefit pension plan which resulted in a settlement of the plan s liabilities resulting in a pre-tax charge of $29.9 million.
889331_16_ITEM8_P51_S5	See Note 12 for additional information.
889331_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Certain amounts presented in the 2014 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation - specifically a reclassification was made to the company s current deferred tax assets from short-term to long-term.
889331_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	This reclassification resulted from the company s early adoption of ASU 2015-17 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASC 740, income taxes) which requires all deferred taxes to be presented as long-term.
889331_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	The amount of current deferred tax assets that were reclassified to long-term deferred tax assets for the fiscal year 2014 was $17.5 million at December 27, 2014.

889331_16_ITEM15_P544_S0	If the excess has not been fully allocated after application of the provisions of paragraph (c), the Administrator shall continue reducing the contributions included in the "deferral percentages" of Highly Compensated Employees, continuing with the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest remaining dollar amount of "deferral percentages" for the Plan Year, in the manner provided in paragraph (c) until the entire excess determined above has been allocated.

889331_16_ITEM15_P562_S0	Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the ACP test described in Section 7.7 is not satisfied in any Plan Year, the Administrator shall determine the dollar amount of the excess by reducing the dollar amount of the contributions included in determining the "contribution percentage" of Highly Compensated Employees in order of their "contribution percentages", as follows:
889331_16_ITEM15_P563_S0	The highest "contribution percentage(s)" shall be reduced to the greater of (1) the maximum "contribution percentage" that satisfies the ACP test described in Section 7.7 or (2) the next highest "contribution percentage".
889331_16_ITEM15_P564_S0	If the ACP described in Section 7.7 is still not satisfied after application of the provisions of paragraph (a), the Administrator shall continue reducing "contribution percentages" of Highly Compensated Employees, continuing with the next highest "contribution percentage", in the manner provided in paragraph (a) until the ACP test described in Section 7.7 is satisfied.
889331_16_ITEM15_P565_S0	The determination of the amount of "excess aggregate contributions" shall be made after application of Sections 7.2, 7.3, and 7.6, if applicable.
889331_16_ITEM15_P566_S0	After determining the dollar amount of the "excess aggregate contributions" that have been made to the Plan, the Administrator shall allocate such excess among Highly Compensated Employees in order of the dollar amount of their "contribution percentages" as follows:
889331_16_ITEM15_P567_S0	The contributions included in the "contribution percentages" of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the largest dollar amount of "contribution percentage" shall be reduced by the dollar amount of the excess (with such dollar amount being allocated equally among all such Highly Compensated Employees), but not below the dollar amount of the "contribution percentage" of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the next highest dollar amount of "contribution percentage" for the Plan Year.
889331_16_ITEM15_P568_S0	If the excess has not been fully allocated after application of the provisions of paragraph (c), the Administrator shall continue reducing the contributions included in the "contribution percentages" of Highly Compensated Employees, continuing with the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest remaining dollar amount of "contribution percentages" for the Plan Year, in the manner provided in paragraph (c) until the entire excess determined above has been allocated.
889331_16_ITEM15_P569_S0	"Excess aggregate contributions" allocated to a Highly Compensated Employee pursuant to the preceding Section, plus any income and minus any losses attributable thereto, shall be forfeited, to the extent forfeitable, or distributed to the Participant prior to the end of the next succeeding Plan Year as hereinafter provided.
889331_16_ITEM15_P569_S1	If such excess amounts are distributed more than 2 1/2 months after the last day of the Plan Year for which the excess occurred, an excise tax of 10% may be imposed under Code Section 4979 on the Employer maintaining the Plan with respect to such amounts.
889331_16_ITEM15_P569_S2	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Plan is an EACA and if provided in the Adoption Agreement, the 2 1/2 month period for distributing "excess aggregate contributions" before application of the 10% excise tax shall be extended until the end of the 6th month following the close of the Plan Year for which the excess occurred.
889331_16_ITEM15_P569_S3	The provisions of the preceding sentence shall not apply unless all Eligible Employees under the Plan are eligible to participate in the EACA, except Eligible Employees who are mandatorily disaggregated under Code Section 410(b).
889331_16_ITEM15_P570_S0	Except as otherwise provided below, excess amounts shall be allocated among a Highly Compensated Employee s Sub-Accounts in the order prescribed by the Administrator, which order shall be uniform with respect to all Highly Compensated Employees and non-discriminatory, and such amounts shall be forfeited or distributed, as appropriate.
889331_16_ITEM15_P570_S1	Excess amounts attributable to After-Tax, 401(k), and Qualified Nonelective Contributions of a Participant shall in all cases be distributed.
889331_16_ITEM15_P570_S2	Excess amounts attributable to Matching Contributions shall be distributed only to the extent a Participant has a vested interest in his Matching Contributions Sub-Account and shall otherwise be forfeited.
889331_16_ITEM15_P570_S3	Any amounts forfeited with respect to a Participant pursuant to this Section shall be treated as a forfeiture under the Plan no later than the last day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year for which the Matching Contributions were made.
889331_16_ITEM15_P571_S0	If excess amounts are to be distributed from the 401(k) Contributions Sub-Account of a Highly Compensated Employee who has made both Pre-Tax and Roth 401(k) Contributions for the year, the type of 401(k) Contributions to be distributed shall be determined as provided in the Adoption Agreement.
889331_16_ITEM15_P572_S0	Any Matching Contributions that are forfeited pursuant to the provisions of the preceding Sections of this Article shall be treated as a forfeiture under the Plan and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Adoption Agreement.
889331_16_ITEM15_P573_S0	The income or loss attributable to "excess contributions", "excess aggregate contributions", or "excess deferrals" shall be determined using the method otherwise used for allocating income or loss to Participants Accounts, unless the Adoption Agreement provides that the IRS alternative method is used.
889331_16_ITEM15_P573_S1	If the Adoption Agreement provides for use of the IRS alternative method, income or loss will be determined by multiplying the income or loss for the preceding Plan Year attributable to the Eligible Employee s Sub-Account to which the contributions were credited by a fraction, the numerator of which is the contributions made to such Sub-Account on the Eligible Employee s behalf for the preceding Plan Year and the denominator of which is (a) the balance of the Sub-Account on the first day of the preceding Plan Year, plus (b) the contributions made to such Sub-Account for the preceding Plan Year.
889331_16_ITEM15_P574_S0	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article to the contrary, if Safe Harbor Matching Contributions or Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions are provided in the Adoption Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall apply with respect to Eligible Employees who are eligible to make 401(k) Contributions and to receive allocations of Safe Harbor Matching Contributions or Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions, as applicable; provided, however, that if discretionary Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions are provided in the Adoption Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall apply for a Plan Year only if the Plan Sponsor timely amends the Plan to provide for Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions.
889331_16_ITEM15_P575_S0	For Plan Years in which the Employers satisfy the safe harbor notice requirements described in Section 7.14, the Plan shall be deemed to have satisfied the ADP test described in Section 7.4.
889331_16_ITEM15_P575_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Adoption Agreement provides for Safe Harbor Matching Contributions, the Plan shall not be deemed to have satisfied the ADP test described in Section 7.4 for any Plan Year unless the ratio of the Matching Contributions made on behalf of each Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year to the Highly Compensated Employee s 401(k) Contributions and After-Tax Contributions, if After-Tax Contributions are matched pursuant to the Adoption Agreement, is not greater than the same ratio calculated with respect to each non-Highly Compensated Employee who has made 401(k) Contributions and After-Tax Contributions, if applicable, for the Plan Year at the same percentage of "test compensation" for the Plan Year as such Highly Compensated Employee.
889331_16_ITEM15_P575_S2	For purposes of determining such ratio, "matching contributions", "elective 401(k) contributions", and "employee contributions", if "employee contributions" are matched, made by or on behalf of a Highly Compensated Employee under another qualified defined contribution plan for any period during which the Highly Compensated Employee participated simultaneously under both the Plan and such other plan, shall be aggregated with the Matching Contributions and 401(k) and After-Tax Contributions of such Highly Compensated Employee.
889331_16_ITEM15_P576_S0	In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(k)-1(e)(7), it is impermissible for the Employer to use ADP testing for a Plan Year in which it is intended for the Plan, as provided through its written terms, to be a Code Section 401(k) safe harbor plan and the Employer fails to satisfy the requirements for the safe harbor for the Plan Year.
889331_16_ITEM15_P577_S0	If the Adoption Agreement provides that the safe harbor will be used to satisfy the non-discrimination requirements applicable to some or all Matching Contributions, the provisions of this Section shall apply with respect to "eligible participants" who are eligible to receive allocations of Matching Contributions and to receive allocations of Safe Harbor Matching Contributions or Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions, as applicable; provided, however, that if the Adoption Agreement provides for discretionary Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions, the provisions of this Section shall apply only if the Plan Sponsor timely amends the Plan to provide for Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions.
889331_16_ITEM15_P578_S0	For Plan Years in which the Employers satisfy the safe harbor notice requirements described in Section 7.14, the Plan shall be deemed to have satisfied the ACP test described in Section 7.7 with respect to Matching Contributions.
889331_16_ITEM15_P578_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan shall not be deemed to have satisfied the ACP test described in Section 7.7 for any Plan Year unless the ratio of Matching Contributions made with respect to the contributions eligible for the match made by each Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year is not greater than the ratio of Matching Contributions made with respect to eligible contributions made by each non-Highly Compensated Employee who has made eligible contributions for the Plan Year at the same percentage of "test compensation" for the Plan Year as such Highly Compensated Employee.
889331_16_ITEM15_P578_S2	For purposes of determining such ratio, "matching contributions", "elective 401(k) contributions", and "employee contributions", if "employee contributions" are matched, made by or on behalf of a Highly Compensated Employee under another qualified defined contribution plan for any period during which the Highly Compensated Employee participated simultaneously under both the Plan and such other plan, shall be aggregated with the Matching Contributions and 401(k) and After-Tax Contributions of such Highly Compensated Employee.
889331_16_ITEM15_P579_S0	Even if the Plan is deemed to have satisfied the ACP test described in Section 7.7 with respect to Matching Contributions, it will not be deemed to have satisfied the ACP test with respect to After-Tax Contributions.
889331_16_ITEM15_P580_S0	For purposes of determining whether the Plan satisfies the ACP test described in Section 7.7, any Safe Harbor Matching Contributions or Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions that are not required to comply with the safe harbor contribution requirements of Code Section 401(k)(12), Code Section 401(k)(13), 401(m)(11), or 401(m)(12) may be included in calculating "contribution percentages".
889331_16_ITEM15_P581_S0	In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(m)-1(c)(2), it is impermissible for the Employer to use ACP testing for a Plan Year in which it is intended for the Plan, as provided through its written terms, to be a Code Section 401(m) safe harbor plan and the Employer fails to satisfy the requirements for the safe harbor for the Plan Year.
889331_16_ITEM15_P582_S0	For each Plan Year in which an Employer makes a Safe Harbor Matching Contribution or Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution on behalf of its Eligible Employees, the Employer shall provide such Eligible Employees a notice describing (i) the formula used for determining Safe Harbor Matching Contributions or Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions or that the Plan may be amended during the Plan Year to provide that his Employer will make a Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution for the Plan Year equal to at least 3% of each Eligible Employee s Compensation; (ii) any other Employer Contributions available under the Plan and the requirements that must be satisfied to receive an allocation of such Employer Contributions; (iii) the type and amount of Compensation that may be contributed under the Plan or another plan maintained by the Employer as contributions eligible for a match under the Plan; (iv) how to make an election to contribute under the Plan and the periods in which such elections may be made or changed; and (v) the withdrawal and vesting provisions applicable to contributions under the Plan, including the vesting provisions applicable to QACA Safe Harbor Matching Contributions or QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions, if applicable.
889331_16_ITEM15_P582_S1	To the extent permitted under Treasury regulations or other guidance, in lieu of including such descriptions in the notice, the descriptions required by this paragraph may be provided by cross-references to the relevant section(s) of an up to date summary plan description or as otherwise permitted under such regulations or other guidance.
889331_16_ITEM15_P583_S0	The notice shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average Eligible Employee.
889331_16_ITEM15_P583_S1	The Employer shall provide such notice within one of the following periods, whichever is applicable:
889331_16_ITEM15_P584_S0	for an Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after that date, within the period beginning 90 days before the date he becomes an Eligible Employee and ending on the date such Employee becomes an Eligible Employee.
889331_16_ITEM15_P585_S0	Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, an Eligible Employee shall have a reasonable period (not fewer than 30 days) following receipt of such notice in which to make or amend his election to have his Employer make 401(k) Contributions to the Plan on his behalf.
889331_16_ITEM15_P586_S0	If an Employer that provides notice that the Plan may be amended to provide a Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution for the Plan Year does amend the Plan to provide such contribution, the Employer shall provide a supplemental notice to all Eligible Employees stating that a Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution in the specified amount shall be made for the Plan Year.
889331_16_ITEM15_P586_S1	Such supplemental notice shall be provided to Eligible Employees at least 30 days before the last day of the Plan Year.
889331_16_ITEM15_P587_S0	Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the "annual addition" with respect to a Participant for a "limitation year" shall in no event exceed the lesser of (i) the maximum dollar amount permitted under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A), adjusted as provided in Code Section 415(d) (e.g., $50,000 for the "limitation year" beginning in 2012) or (ii) 100% of the Participant s "415 compensation" for the "limitation year"; provided, however, that the limit in clause (i) shall be pro-rated for any short "limitation year".
889331_16_ITEM15_P587_S1	The limit in clause (ii) shall not apply to any contribution to an individual medical account, as defined in Code Section 415(1), or to a post-retirement medical benefits account maintained for a key employee which is treated as an "annual addition" under Code Section 419A(d)(2).
889331_16_ITEM15_P587_S2	Contributions may be re-characterized as Catch-Up 401(k) Contributions and excluded from the Participant s "annual additions" for the "limitation year" to satisfy the preceding limitation.
889331_16_ITEM15_P588_S0	If the Employer or a Related Employer participates in a multiemployer plan, in determining whether the "annual additions" made on behalf of a Participant to the Plan, when aggregated with "annual additions" made on the Participant s behalf under the multiemployer plan satisfy the above limitation, only "annual additions" made by the Employer (or a Related Employer) to the multiemployer plan shall be aggregated with the "annual additions" under the Plan and "415 compensation" shall include only compensation paid to the Participant by the Employer (or a Related Employer).
889331_16_ITEM15_P589_S0	If the "annual addition" to the Account of a Participant in any "limitation year" nevertheless exceeds the amount that may be applied for his benefit under the limitations described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, correction may be made in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System, as set forth in Revenue Procedure 2013-12, or any superseding guidance.
889331_16_ITEM15_P590_S0	If a Participant is covered by any other qualified defined contribution plan (whether or not terminated) maintained by an Employer or a Related Employer concurrently with the Plan, and if the "annual addition" to be made under the Plan for the "limitation year" when combined with the "annual addition" to be made under such other qualified defined contribution plan(s) would otherwise exceed the amount that may be applied for the Participant s benefit under the limitation contained in the preceding Section, the following shall apply:
889331_16_ITEM15_P591_S0	If the Adoption Agreement provides that other plans will be reduced first, the "annual addition" to be made to such other plan(s) shall be reduced, to the extent necessary so that the limitation in the preceding Section is satisfied.
889331_16_ITEM15_P592_S0	If the Adoption Agreement provides for a pro rata reduction among all plans, the "annual additions" to be made under the Plan and such other plan(s) shall be reduced on a pro rata basis, to the extent necessary so that the limitation in the preceding Section is satisfied.
889331_16_ITEM15_P593_S0	If the Adoption Agreement provides that the Plan will be reduced first, the "annual addition" to be made under the Plan shall be reduced, to the extent necessary so that the limitation in the preceding Section is satisfied.
889331_16_ITEM15_P594_S0	If the Adoption Agreement provides that the last amounts to be allocated will be reduced first, the "annual additions" last scheduled for allocation under the Plan and such other plan(s) shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the limitation in the preceding Section is satisfied.
889331_16_ITEM15_P594_S1	If "annual additions" are scheduled to be allocated as of the same date, any excess shall be allocated pro rata among the defined contribution plans.
889331_16_ITEM15_P595_S0	If the Adoption Agreement provides another method of reduction, the "annual additions" to be allocated (rather than any excess already allocated) shall be reduced as provided in the Adoption Agreement.
889331_16_ITEM15_P596_S0	If the "annual addition" to the Account of a Participant in any "limitation year", when combined with the "annual addition" made under any other qualified defined contribution plan maintained by an Employer or a Related Employer, nevertheless exceeds the amount that may be applied for the Participant s benefit under the limitation contained in the preceding Section, correction may be made in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System, as set forth in Revenue Procedure 2013-12, or any superseding guidance.

889331_16_ITEM15_P598_S0	If the Adoption Agreement provides that Participants do not direct the investment of all or some contributions to the Plan and the Adoption Agreement does not specify a particular Investment Fund to which such contributions will be invested, a General Fund shall be maintained to hold and administer such contributions.

889331_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Reorganization activities may lead to additional costs and material adverse effects.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In the past we have taken actions to restructure and optimize our production and manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through relocations, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In the future we may take additional restructuring actions including the consolidating, closing or selling of additional facilities.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These actions could result in impairment charges and various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs and severance costs, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate our business.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	These activities may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Environmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes or in our finished goods.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	These environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Under these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state, and local laws.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	These releases or migrations may give rise to claims.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws and regulations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The risk of environmental remediation exists and the company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply or distribution chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We source materials and sell product through various international network channels.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	A disruption could occur within our manufacturing, distribution or supply chain network.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	This could include damage or destruction due to various causes including natural disasters or political instability which would cause one or more of these network channels to become non-operational.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	This could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or deliver our products in a timely manner, impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Such a disruption could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive industry and we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting this industry including industry cyclicality, and unexpected product recalls as well as the success of our customers products.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Net sales to the automotive industry represent a substantial portion of our revenues.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Factors negatively affecting this industry and the demand for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, tax policies and regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules, unexpected product recalls or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	To the extent that demand for certain of our customers products declines, the demand for our products may decline.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, or interest rates may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions, and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Fixed costs may reduce operating results if our sales fall below expectations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future sales.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The volatility of our stock price could affect the value of an investment in our stock and our future financial position.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The market price of our stock can fluctuate widely.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Between January 2, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $90.61 and a high of $156.54.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as volatility in the financial markets, general macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, analysts expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under Our Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Also, we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	As with most companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems, and other similar incidents, none of which have been material.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; and jeopardize the security of our facilities.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, and other cyber-attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Nevertheless, lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in our internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	There can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not exist.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties, judgments or losses not covered by insurance, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The c ompany s effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors, including U.S. and/or international tax legislation, mix of the c ompany s earnings by jurisdiction, and U.S. and foreign jurisdictional tax audits.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Therefore, it is subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions and such changes could have a material adverse affect on the company s effective tax rate and cash flows.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	As a U.S. company with significant non-U.S. operations (generally taxed at rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory rate), it is particularly susceptible to changes in U.S. tax rules.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Various U.S. corporate tax legislative proposals are under consideration, some of which may have a material adverse effect on the company s effective tax rate and cash flows.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions are considering tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in connection with its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting study.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P60_S3	The outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s effective tax rate and cash flows.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which the company operates vary widely.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Therefore, the company s effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of its earnings by jurisdiction.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The company is also subject to examination of its tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could affect our business results.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our success, both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions, depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategy.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may not be successful protecting our patents and trademarks.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We consider our intellectual property, including patents, trade names, and trademarks, to be of significant value to our business as a whole.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Our products are manufactured, marketed, and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We develop and acquire new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and consider all of our intellectual property to be valuable.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P66_S3	The company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the great majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements.
889331_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Based on the broad scope of our product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, multiple losses or expirations could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The company s operations are located in 51 owned or leased facilities worldwide, totaling approximately 2.8 million square feet.
889331_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The company s corporate headquarters is located in the U.S. in Chicago, Illinois.

889331_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	Asia-Pacific operations include sales and distribution centers located in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, China, and Korea, with manufacturing plants located in the Philippines, Japan, and various cities in China.
889331_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	The company does not believe that it will encounter any difficulty in renewing its existing leases upon the expiration of their current terms.
889331_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	Management believes that the company s facilities are adequate to meet its requirements for the foreseeable future.
889331_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	The following table provides certain information concerning the company s facilities at December 31, 2016, and the use of these facilities during fiscal year 2016:
889331_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	Properties with lease expirations in 2017 may be renewed at various times throughout the year.
889331_17_ITEM2_P3_S1	The company does not anticipate any material impact as a result of such expirations.
889331_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The company is not a party to any material legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to our business.
889331_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Shares of the company s common stock are traded under the symbol LFUS on the NASDAQ Global Select Market SM .
889331_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below provides information with respect to the company s quarterly stock prices and cash dividends declared and paid for each quarter during fiscal 2016 and 2015:
889331_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 16, 2017, there were 76 holders of record of the company s common stock.
889331_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The company expects that its practice of paying quarterly dividends on its common stock will continue although future dividend policy will be determined by the Board of Directors based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash availability, and general business prospects.
889331_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Currently, there are restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the company s credit agreements that relate to the maintenance of certain financial ratios.
889331_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	However, the company expects to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future.
889331_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	There were no sales of unregistered securities by us or affiliates during the three months ended December 31, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	The company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the company s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017.
889331_17_ITEM5_P6_S1	The company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during fiscal 2016 and 1,000,000 shares may yet be purchased under the program as of December 31, 2016.

889331_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	The company s customer base includes OEMs, Tier One automotive suppliers, and distributors.
889331_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We experienced strong performance improvements in 2016 including crossing the milestone of $1 billion in revenue and recognizing record earnings and cash flow.
889331_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We made substantial progress in growth from our strategic 2016 acquisitions which contributed approximately $250 million in annualized revenue.
889331_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	We are well positioned for success with our updated strategy, which focuses on accelerated organic growth, while continuing to add acquisitions aligned to our core circuit protection, sensor , and power control platforms.
889331_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	For 2016, we recognized net sales of $1,056.2 million, a 22% increase versus the prior year period.
889331_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Acquisitions contributed significantly to the growth in revenue.
889331_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Organic growth was due to growth in most end markets across our electronics segment as well as our automotive fuses and sensor business.
889331_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	This was partially offset by declines in our industrial segment and our commercial vehicle products business within our automotive segment.
889331_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We recognized Net Income of $104.5 million, an increase of 29.2%.

889331_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Of the $266.7 million held by foreign subsidiaries, at least $50 million can be repatriated with minimal tax consequences, considering both U.S. and foreign taxes.
889331_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	Other than amounts which can be repatriated with minimal tax consequences, the company expects to maintain its foreign cash balances for local operating requirements, to provide funds for future capital expenditures and for potential acquisitions and does not expect to repatriate these funds to the U.S.
889331_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations.
889331_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Management expects that the company s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the company s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.

889331_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	The new credit agreement consists of an unsecured revolving credit facility of $575.0 million and an unsecured term loan credit facility of up to $125.0 million.
889331_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	In addition, the company has the ability, from time to time, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility by up to an additional $150.0 million, in the aggregate, in each case in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of participating lenders.

889331_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities (including short-term and long-term items) that negatively impacted cash flows in 2016 consisted of changes in accounts receivable ($25.2 million), accrued taxes ($18.1 million) and prepaid expenses and other ($0.3 million).
889331_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase in accounts receivable reflects increased sales in 2016 compared to the prior year.
889331_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	Positively impacting cash flows were changes in inventory ($8.5 million), accrued expenses including post-retirement ($2.3 million), accounts payable ($19.2 million) and accrued payroll and severance ($6.1 million).
889331_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Net cash used in investing activities increased $467.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the acquisitions of PolySwitch ($344.5 million, net of cash acquired), the ON portfolio business ($104.0 million), and Menber s ($19.2 million).

889331_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	The increase was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from debt of $314.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015.
889331_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	In March the company replaced its credit agreement with a new agreement and in December the company received proceeds from the issuance of senior notes.
889331_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	Also contributing to the increase in comparative periods was the use of cash for the share repurchase in 2015 of $31.3 million.
889331_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Information regarding the company s debt is provided in Note 8, Debt , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
889331_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased $12.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014.
889331_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was approximately $165.8 million and included $80.9 million in net income, $82.2 million in non-cash adjustments (primarily $41.7 million in depreciation and amortization) and $2.7 million of favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities.
889331_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities (including short-term and long-term items) that negatively impacted cash flows in 2015 consisted of changes in accounts receivable ($14.4 million), inventory ($3.6 million).
889331_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Increases in accounts receivable and inventory resulted from higher sales volumes in 2015.

889331_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Net cash used in investing activities decreased $59.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to less cash used for business acquisitions in 2015 compared to 2014.
889331_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	In 2014 the company acquired Symcom for $52.8 million, net of cash acquired while in 2015 the company paid $4.6 million, net of cash acquired, toward the acquisition of Sigmar.
889331_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net cash used in financing activities increased $24.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to increased use of cash for the repurchase of stock.
889331_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the company s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	The company repurchased 350,000 shares of its common stock during 2015 under this program.
889331_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	We expend capital to support our operating and strategic plans.
889331_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Such expenditures include strategic acquisitions, investments to maintain capital assets, develop new products or improve existing products, and to enhance capacity or productivity.
889331_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	Many of the associated projects have long lead-times and require commitments in advance of actual spending.
889331_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	The company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the company s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017.
889331_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	The company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during fiscal 2016 and the full 1,000,000 shares may yet be purchased under the program as of December 31, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:
889331_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.
889331_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	Specifically, the company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties, the company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity and the company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets.
889331_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
889331_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	This ASU provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.
889331_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards.
889331_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which postponed the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted on the original effective date of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The company is in the process of performing its initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and has not concluded on its adoption methodology.
889331_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	While the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standards, the company s revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers.
889331_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	Sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks, and rewards transfer.
889331_17_ITEM7_P82_S4	These are largely un-affected by the new standard.
889331_17_ITEM7_P82_S5	The company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the amount of overall sales recognized; however, the timing of sales on certain projects may be affected.
889331_17_ITEM7_P82_S6	The company has not yet quantified this potential impact.
889331_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842).
889331_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months.
889331_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged.
889331_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
889331_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition.
889331_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	The company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
889331_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).
889331_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	This ASU modifies the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
889331_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
889331_17_ITEM7_P85_S3	Because the update will eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, it should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment.
889331_17_ITEM7_P85_S4	This ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
889331_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements.
889331_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position.
889331_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	The company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results, as they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	This generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts sales and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Volume Rebates: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	The company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life, and quality issues.
889331_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	Based on the analysis, the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	During 2016, the company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting.
889331_17_ITEM7_P97_S2	This step-up was approximately $7.8 million for the PolySwitch, ON portfolio, and Menber s acquisitions in 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired.
889331_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.
889331_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Due to negative events in the potash market in 2016, management revisited its long term projections and conducted a step one goodwill impairment analysis for its custom products reporting unit in the third quarter of 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	The reporting unit failed the step one test and management conducted a step two analysis with the revised projections.
889331_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	The fair value of the unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows over a seven year forecast period and appraisal of certain assets.
889331_17_ITEM7_P100_S3	As a result, the company recognized a charge for goodwill impairment of $8.8 million as it wrote off the entire goodwill balance.
889331_17_ITEM7_P100_S4	In addition, the company recognized intangible assets impairments aggregating $6.0 million, including a $3.8 million reduction of the custom products trade names to a $0.7 million remaining value and a $2.2 million reduction of the reporting unit s customer relationships to zero value.
889331_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 2, 2016, the company had seven reporting units for goodwill testing purposes and concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	Specifically, the company noted that the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 65%, 154%, 218%, 132%, 70%, 15%, and 150% for its reporting units; electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car, commercial vehicle products, sensors, relays, and power fuse, respectively, at October 2, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 9.8% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% which were used for all reporting units except for relays which had a discount rate of 10.3% as a result of a 0.5% premium factor.
889331_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at October 2, 2016 that showed either a 100 basis point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at October 2, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist.
889331_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	However, it is possible that we could recognize impairment charges for the relays reporting unit if we have declines in profitability or projected future operating results due to changes in volume, market pricing, cost, or the business environment.
889331_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	As of the 2016 annual test date, the relays reporting unit had $41.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets.
889331_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	The company evaluates long-lived asset groups on an ongoing basis.
889331_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	Long-lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable.
889331_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.
889331_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
889331_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	The company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results.
889331_17_ITEM7_P107_S3	The company did not record asset impairment charges in 2016 or 2015, but did recognize asset impairment charges of $0.3 million in 2014.

889331_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_17_ITEM7_P112_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_17_ITEM7_P112_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_17_ITEM7_P112_S4	During 2015, the company settled its U.S. defined benefit pension plan as described in Note 10, Benefit Plans , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

889331_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	The fair value of stock-option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
889331_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors.
889331_17_ITEM7_P114_S2	Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options.
889331_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
889331_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	The company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to continue making cash dividend payments in the foreseeable future.

889331_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
889331_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	The company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
889331_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

889331_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
889331_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 12, Income Taxes , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The company had $232.8 million in debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 related to the unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Because 100% of this debt has variable interest rates, the company is subject to future interest rate fluctuations in relation to these borrowings which could potentially have a negative impact on cash flows of the company.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	A prospective increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate applicable to the company s outstanding borrowings under its credit facility would result in an increase of approximately $2.3 million in annual interest expense.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The company is not party to any currency exchange or interest rate protection agreements as of December 31, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The majority of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The company has manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, China, Italy, Lithuania, Japan and the Philippines.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	During 2016, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 66% of total net sales.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	During 2015, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 60% of total net sales.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese renminbi or Taiwanese dollars.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, external borrowings, inter-company loans, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company s most significant net long exposure is to the euro.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The company s most significant net short exposures are to the Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The company uses netting and offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures where possible.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold, and silver.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the company s earnings.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper, zinc, gold, and silver, where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect annual pre-tax profit by approximately $2.4 million for copper, $0.9 million for zinc, $0.2 million for gold, $0.5 million for silver, and $0.3 million for tin.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The cost of oil has fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Consequently, there is a risk that a return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2017 could have a significant impact on the company s transportation and utility expenses.
889331_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	While the company is exposed to significant changes in certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, the company actively monitors these exposures and takes various actions to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

889331_17_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
889331_17_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our audit of, and opinion on, the Company s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of PolySwitch, Menber s and the ON Portfolio businesses, wholly-owned subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 36 percent and 16 percent, respectively, in aggregate, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM8_P6_S4	As indicated in Management s Report, PolySwitch, Menber s and the ON Portfolio businesses were acquired during 2016.
889331_17_ITEM8_P6_S5	Management s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of PolySwitch, Menber s and the ON Portfolio businesses.

889331_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889331_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
889331_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	In addition, the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole.

889331_17_ITEM8_P39_S4	In addition, the company recognized intangible assets impairments aggregating $6.0 million, including a $3.8 million reduction of the custom products trade names to a $0.7 million remaining value and a $2.2 million reduction of the reporting unit s customer relationships to zero value.
889331_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 2, 2016, the company had seven reporting units for goodwill testing purposes and concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore, no potential goodwill impairment existed.
889331_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	Specifically, the company noted that the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 65%, 154%, 218%, 132%, 70%, 15%, and 150% for its reporting units; electronics (non-silicon), electronics (silicon), passenger car, commercial vehicle products, sensors, relays, and power fuse, respectively, at October 2, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of 9.8% and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% which were used for all reporting units except for relays which had a discount rate of 10.3% as a result of a 0.5% premium factor.
889331_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	The company will continue to perform a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis, if certain impairment conditions exist.
889331_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Factors the company considers important, which could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples.
889331_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	Due to the diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results.
889331_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	However, it is possible that we could recognize impairment charges for the relays reporting unit if we have declines in profitability or projected future operating results due to changes in volume, market pricing, cost, or the business environment.
889331_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	As of the 2016 annual test date, the relays reporting unit had $41.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets.
889331_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20 years.
889331_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 17 years.
889331_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of three to 20 years.
889331_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	Other intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause the asset to be impaired.
889331_17_ITEM8_P44_S4	As described above, in 2016 the company recognized an impairment charge of $2.2 million to reduce the custom products reporting unit s customer relationships to zero value.
889331_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company.
889331_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
889331_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
889331_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract.
889331_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	These assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors.
889331_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	Actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
889331_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.
889331_17_ITEM8_P47_S4	During 2015, the company terminated the U.S. defined benefit pension plan which resulted in a settlement of the plan s liabilities resulting in a pre-tax charge of $29.9 million.
889331_17_ITEM8_P47_S5	See Note 10, Benefit Plans , for additional information.
889331_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	This generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured, and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	The company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors.
889331_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the company s published price lists.
889331_17_ITEM8_P51_S3	The customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	If the company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	The company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	The company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	The company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	The company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	Accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be uncollectible, are written off against the reserve on a case-by-case basis.
889331_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	However, due to the company s diverse customer base and lack of credit concentration, the company does not believe its estimates would be materially impacted by changes in its assumptions.
889331_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The company expenses advertising costs as incurred, which amounted to $2.9 million, $2.3 million, and $2.8 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and are included as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses.

889331_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The company s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, as appropriate.
889331_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average rates.
889331_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	The amount of foreign currency gain or loss from remeasurement recognized in the income statement was a loss of $0.5 million in 2016, a gain of $1.5 million in 2015, and a loss of $3.9 million in 2014.
889331_17_ITEM8_P60_S3	Adjustments from the translation process are recognized in Shareholders equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income.
889331_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The company recognizes compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity compensation using a fair value method.
889331_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as both operating and financing cash flows.
889331_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	See Note 11, Shareholders Equity , for additional information on stock-based compensation.
889331_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Included in other long-term liabilities is an accrual related to former coal mining operations at Littelfuse GmbH (formerly known as Heinrich Industries, AG) for the amounts of 1.4 million ($1.5 million) and 1.8 million ($2.0 million) at December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively.
889331_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Management, in conjunction with an independent third-party, performs an annual evaluation of the former coal mining operations in order to develop an estimate of the probable future obligations in regard to remediating the dangers (such as a shaft collapse) of abandoned coal mine shafts in the former coal mining operations.
889331_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	Management accrues for costs associated with such remediation efforts based on management's best estimate when such costs are probable and reasonably able to be estimated.
889331_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	The ultimate determination can only be done after respective investigations because the concrete conditions are mostly unknown at this time.
889331_17_ITEM8_P63_S3	The accrual is not discounted as management cannot reasonably estimate when such remediation efforts will take place.
889331_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	Other expense (income), net generally consists of interest income, royalties, and non-operating income.

889331_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Certain amounts presented in the 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.
889331_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
889331_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
889331_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
889331_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	The amended guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis.
889331_17_ITEM8_P69_S4	The company adopted the new guidance on January 3, 2016 and has made the corresponding reclassification on its balance sheet for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM8_P69_S5	The adoption of the new guidance had no effect on the company s net income, cash flows or shareholders equity.
889331_17_ITEM8_P69_S6	Additionally, the company has reclassified a portion of its current tax position at January 2, 2016 to more accurately reflect its prepaid/liability position at a jurisdictional level.
889331_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	This ASU provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.
889331_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards.
889331_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which postponed the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted on the original effective date of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
889331_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	The company is in the process of performing its initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and has not concluded on its adoption methodology.
889331_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	While the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standards, the company s revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers.
889331_17_ITEM8_P71_S3	Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks, and rewards transfer.
889331_17_ITEM8_P71_S4	These are largely un-affected by the new standard.
889331_17_ITEM8_P71_S5	The company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the amount of overall sales recognized; however, the timing of sales on certain projects may be affected.
889331_17_ITEM8_P71_S6	The company has not yet quantified this potential impact.
889331_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842).
889331_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months.
889331_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged.
889331_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
889331_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition.
889331_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	The company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
889331_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).
889331_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	This ASU modifies the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
889331_17_ITEM8_P74_S2	An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
889331_17_ITEM8_P74_S3	Because the update will eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, it should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment.
889331_17_ITEM8_P74_S4	This ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
889331_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	In the second quarter of 2016, management determined that the company may incur additional income taxes and interest in a foreign jurisdiction with respect to the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years.
889331_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	The cumulative adjustment for this income tax (including interest of $1.5 million) as of January 2, 2016, is approximately $4.9 million.
889331_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	The adjustment applicable to 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $1.6 million, $1.3 million, $1.0 million, $0.9 million, and $0.1 million, respectively.

889331_17_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Based on this assessment, the company s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
889331_17_ITEM9A_P13_S0	There has been no change in the company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the 12 months or fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company s internal control over financial reporting.

889331_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The Company competes on the basis of price, quality, service, and / or brand name across the industries and markets it serves.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Competitive pressures could affect the prices the Company is able to charge its customers or the demand for its products.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company may not always be able to compete on price, particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of the Company s competitors have substantially greater sales, financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than the Company.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	As other companies enter its markets or develop new products, competition may further intensify.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The Company s failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company engages in strategic acquisitions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions and / or may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Company seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In the past, the Company has acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Company intends to continue to expand and diversify its operations with additi onal future acquisitions.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	An acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to the Company s expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the Company s anticipated timetable.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	This could cause the Company s financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The success of these transactions also depends on the Company s ability to integrate the assets, operations, and personnel associated with these acquisitions.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with the Company s operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that are anticipated from an acquisition.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Company may also discover liabilities or de ficiencies associated with the companies or assets it acquires that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The effectiveness of the Company s due diligence review and its ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies acquired or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, the Company may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Acquisitions may also result in recording of significant additional expenses to the results of operations and recording of substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet upon closing.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Any of these factors may adversely affect the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Reorganization activities may lead to additional costs and material adverse effects.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In t he past, the Company has taken actions to restructure and optimize its production and manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through relocations, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In the future, the Company may take additional restructuring actions including the consolidating, closing or selling of additional facilities.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These actions could result in impairment charges and various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs and severance costs, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company may be unsuccessful in any of its current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate its business.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These activities may have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers needs.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The end markets for the Company s products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render its existing products obsolete and unmarketable before it can recover any or all of its research, development, and commercialization expenses on capital investments.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Furthermore, the life cycles of its products may change and are difficult to estimate.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company s future success will depend upon its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers needs.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The Company will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of its customers.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company invests heavily in research and development without knowing that it will recover these costs.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Company s competitors may develop products or technologies that will render its products non-competitive or obsolete.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If it cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company s ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages is limited.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, the Company is exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company has multiple sources of supply for the majority of its commodity requirements.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices the Company charges its customers, its product costs, and the competitive position of its products and services.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Company monitors and manages these exposures as an integral part of its overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on its results.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, because of intense price competition and the Company s high level of fixed costs, it may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	In addition, significant portions of its revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	As it operates in multiple foreign currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact its revenues and expenses.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	The impact of possible currency devaluation in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact the Company s results and financial guidance.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P17_S9	For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks .
889331_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Company s effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors, including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the Tax Act (defined below), U.S. and/or international tax legislation, mix of the Company s earnings by jurisdiction, and U.S. and foreign jurisdictional tax audits.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ).
889331_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Among other things, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, adds base broadening provisions which limit deductions and address tax efficient international structures, imposes a one-time tax (the Toll Charge ) on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and enables repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries free of U.S. federal income tax.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Other than the Toll Charge (which is applicable to the Company for 2017), the provisions will generally be applicable to the Company in 2018 and beyond.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 118, in the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded a charge of $47 million as a provisional reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $49 million for the Toll Charge net of $2 million for other net tax benefits.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The Company is continuing to analyze the Tax Act and plans to finalize the estimate within the measurement period outlined in SAB No.118.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The final charge may differ from the provisional reasonable estimate (and such difference may be material) if provisions of the Tax Act, and their interaction with other provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, are interpreted differently than interpretations made by the Company in determining the estimate, whether through issuance of administrative guidance, or through further review of the Tax Act by the Company and its advisors.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Depending upon future interpretations and administrative guidance in respect of the Tax Act s base broadening provisions, the Tax Act could have a material adverse effect on the Company s effective tax rate and cash flows.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Therefore, it is subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions and such changes could have a material adverse affect on the Company s effective tax rate and cash flows.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As a U.S. Company with significant non-U.S. operations (generally taxed at rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory rate), it is particularly susceptible to changes in U.S. tax rules.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions are considering tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in connection with its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting study.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company s effective tax rate and cash flows.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which the Company operates vary widely.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Therefore, the Company s effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of its earnings by jurisdiction.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company is also subject to examination of its tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A decline in expected profitability of the Company or individual reporting units of the Company could results in the impairment of assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company holds material amounts of goodwill and other long-lived assets on its balance sheet.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of the Company s related goodwill and other long-lived tangible and intangible assets and require the write down or write off of these assets.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A significant fluctuation between the U.S.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	d ollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company s revenue and earnings.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Although the Company s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, the majority of the Company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Company s most significant net long exposure is to the euro.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The Company s most significant net short exposures are to the Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Company s revenues may vary significantly from period to period.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Company s revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:
889331_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect the Company .
889331_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for the Company s products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The Company is exposed to pol itical, economic, and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company has significant operating activities in numerous countries around the globe that contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the Company to place its production in countries outside the U.S., including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, the Company sources a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company s operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with multi-national operations, including risks relating to the following:
889331_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	limitations on the Company s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Disruptions in the Company s manufacturing, supply or distribution chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company sources materials and sell product through various international network channels.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	A disruption could occur within the Company s manufacturing, distribution or supply chain network.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	This could include damage or destruction due to various causes including natural disasters or political instability which would cause one or more of these network channels to become non-operational.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	This could adversely affect the Company s ability to manufacture or deliver its products in a timely manner, impair its ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to its reputation.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Such a disruption could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect the Company s business and financial results.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company s ability to invest in its businesses, make strategic acquisitions, and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If the Company is unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, it could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Fixed costs may reduce operating results if sales fall below expectations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company s expense levels are based, in part, on its expectations for future sales.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Many of the Company s expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The Company might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect the Company s operating results.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The volatility of the Company s stock price could affect the value of an investment in the Company s stock and future financial position.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The market price of the Company s stock can fluctuate widely.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Between December 31, 2016 and December 30, 2017, the closing sale price of the Company s common stock ranged between a low of $146.94 and a high of $215.00.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The volatility of the stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as volatility in the financial markets, general macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, analysts expectations concerning the Company s results of operations, or the volatility of its revenues as discussed above under The Company s Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	The historic market price of the Company s common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	The Company may not be able to sustain or increase the value of its common stock.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Declines in the market price of the Company s stock could adversely affect the Company s ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving the Company s common stock.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company is exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to its information technology systems and data security.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company relies on its information technology systems and networks in connection with many of its business activities.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under the Company s direct control.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As with most companies, the Company has experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach its systems, and other similar incidents, none of which have been material.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; and jeopardize the security of the Company s facilities.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, and other cyber-attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject the Company to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage the Company s reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The Company continuously seeks to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on the Company s competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The Company s business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	A work stoppage could occur at certain of the Company s facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, the Company may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of its suppliers.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	A significant work stoppage, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	The transfer of the Company s manufacturing operations and changes in its distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could affect the Company s business results.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The Company s success, both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions, depends on the Company s ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede its ability to deliver growth objectives and execute the Company s strategy.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder the Company s ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Environmental liabilities could adversely impact the Company s financial position.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in the Company s manufacturing processes or in its finished goods.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These environmental regulations have required the Company to expend a portion of its resources and capital on relevant compliance programs.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Under these laws and regulations, the Company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if its current or former properties are contaminated or if it sends waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if the Company did not cause the contamination.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The Company may be subject to additional common law claims if it releases substances that damage or harm third parties.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P56_S4	In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject the Company to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In the conduct of manufacturing operations, the Company has handled and does handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state, and local laws.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, the Company operates or owns facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	These releases or migrations may give rise to claims.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon the Company under environmental laws and regulations.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The Company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The risk of environmental remediation exists and the Company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force the Company to incur additional expenses.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals, the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Also, the Company may face challenges with its customers and suppliers if it is unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in its products are conflict free.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The Company may not be successful protecting its patents and trademarks.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The Company considers its intellectual property, including patents, trade names, and trademarks, to be of significant value to its business as a whole.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The Company s products are manufactured, marketed, and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The Company develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and consider all of its intellectual property to be valuable.
889331_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The Company s policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the great majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements.

889331_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company s strategic plan is focused on maximizing shareholder value by driving profitable sales growth, earnings per share growth, strong cash flow generation, and maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation.
889331_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Company pursues the following major strategic initiatives, which are summarized below, along with more specific areas of focus .
889331_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company s strategy is to generate profitable sales growth.
889331_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	In order to accomplish this, The Company is focusing on accelerating organic growth by increasing its content and share gains, enhancing technology efforts to drive innovation , capitalizing on cross segment opportunities, and gaining traction in underpenetrated geographies and markets.
889331_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Company will continue to make targeted strategic acquisitions that align to its strategy and financial targets to support new business, products, markets, and technologies while leveraging existing customers.
889331_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Management believes that sustaining profitability through a combination of profitable organic growth and acquisitions is critical to the Company s competitiveness, while enhancing value the Company delivers to its customers.
889331_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition, the Company continues to implement initiatives across all platforms to enhance productivity while managing its cost structure, including integration of operations and streamlining administrative and support activities to drive operating margins.
889331_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The C ompany seeks to deploy its capital using a balanced approach.
889331_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Priorities for capital deployment, over time, include investments to drive increased organic growth, targeted acquisitions that align to the Company s strategic and financial metrics and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and periodic share repurchases.
889331_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company uses several key indicators to gauge progress toward achieving these objectives.
889331_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	These indicators include organic sales growth, operating margins, cash flow from o perations and capital expenditures.
889331_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Company targets long-term sales double digit sales growth, split between 5-7% annual organic sales growth and 5-7% annual growth from strategic acquisitions, while targeting operating margins between 17% and 19% and double -digit earnings per share growth.
889331_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Cash flow from operations less capital expenditures is targeted to approximate net income but in any given year can be significantly impacted by the timing of non-recurring or infrequent expenditures.
889331_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889331_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company s most critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
889331_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and judgments.
889331_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made, and therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
889331_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	The Company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
889331_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
889331_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	This generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts sales and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third-party distributors.
889331_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenue and Billing : The Company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company s published price lists.
889331_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	The customer is invoiced when the Company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Returns and Credits : Some of the terms of the Company s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the Company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	If the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Return to Stock : The Company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer, with previous authorization from management, can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.
889331_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity.
889331_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.
889331_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Volume Rebates : The Company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets.
889331_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates.
889331_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
889331_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the Company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life, and quality issues.
889331_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Based on the analysis, the Company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
889331_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values.
889331_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	During 2017, the Company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting.
889331_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	This step-up was approximately $1.6 million for the U.S. Sensor acquisition in 2017.
889331_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company s methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of a number of factors, including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate.
889331_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
889331_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Based on its current organization structure, the Company has seven reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill has be allocated.
889331_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative excess fair value of each reporting unit.
889331_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
889331_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit.
889331_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit s operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year s annual impairment test.
889331_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events.
889331_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	For the seven reporting units with goodwill, the Company compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
889331_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value, the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value is recorded as the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
889331_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The results of the goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017 indicated that the estimated fair values for each of the seven reporting units with goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values.
889331_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	Accordingly, there were no goodwill impairment charges recorded as part of the Company s 2017 annual goodwill impairment test.
889331_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	As part of its impairment test for these reporting units, the Company engaged a third-party appraisal firm to assist in the Company s determination of the estimated fair values.
889331_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	This determination included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches.
889331_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items.
889331_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The market approach estimates fair values using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
889331_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Company weighted both the income and market approach equally to estimate the concluded fair value of each reporting unit.
889331_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	The determination of fair value requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, which primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures.
889331_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.
889331_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units.
889331_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Future declines in the overall market value of the Company s equity may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
889331_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	One measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit passed (fair value exceeds the carrying value ) the goodwill impairment test.
889331_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	All seven of the reporting units passed the goodwill impairment test, with fair values that exceeded the carrying values by between 25% and 3 14% of their respective estimated fair values.
889331_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 1, 2017, the Company noted that the excess of fair value over the carrying value, was 161%, 314%, 247%, 218%, 100%, 25%, and 248% for its reporting units: Electronics (non-silicon), Electronics (silicon), Passenger Car, Commercial Vehicle Products, Sensors, Relays, and Power Fuse, respectively.
889331_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Relatively small changes in the Company s key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test.
889331_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Generally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
889331_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	That is, a 1.0% decrease in estimated annual future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1.0%.
889331_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	The estimated long-term net sales growth rate can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit.
889331_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	A 1.0% decrease in the long-term net sales growth rate would have resulted in no reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test.
889331_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate.
889331_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The estimated discount rate was 9.6% for all reporting units except for Relays which had a discount rate of 10.1%.
889331_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	A 1.0% increase in the estimated discount rates would have resulted in no reporting units failing the annual goodwill impairment test.
889331_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates.

889331_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Income before income taxes was impacted by an increase in operating income described above, partially offset by high er interest expense of $4.8 million reflecting increased borrowings and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $1.9 million primarily as a result of fluctuations in the Chinese renminbi and Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar partially offset by fluctuations in the Euro against U.S. dollar.
889331_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Income tax expense for 2017 was $84.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 41.4% compared to income tax expense of $18.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 15.2%, for 2016.

889331_18_ITEM7_P71_S4	Aside from these interpretation issues, the final charge may differ from the provisional reasonable estimate due to refinements of accumulated non-U.S. earnings and tax pool data.
889331_18_ITEM7_P71_S5	Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 are lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions partially offset by the impact of taxes on unremitted earnings, and, with respect to 2016, a one-time deduction with respect to the stock of one of the Company s affiliates, partially offset by the impact of the impairment of goodwill for which no tax benefit was recorded.

889331_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	During 2016, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 66% of total net sales.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese renminbi or Taiwanese dollars.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from inter-company loans, external borrowings, sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries.

889331_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the company s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 30, 2017, the net value of the Company s assets with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately $298 million, with the largest exposure being U.S. Dollar denominated inter-company loans with a Philippine peso functional currency subsidiary.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive asset instruments would be $30 million at December 30, 2017.

889331_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive liability instruments would be $20 million at December 30, 2017.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P4_S4	As a result of the mix in currencies impacting the hypothetical 10% changes, the movements in some instruments would offset movements in other instruments reducing the hypothetical exposure to the Company.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold, and silver.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact the Company s earnings.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The most significant of these exposures is to copper, zinc, gold, and silver, where at current prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect annual pre-tax profit by approximately $3.9 million for copper, $1.5 million for zinc, $0.2 million for gold, $0.8 million for silver, and $0.6 million for tin.
889331_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The cost of oil has fluctuated dramatically over the past several years.

889331_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889331_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889331_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates current replacement cost.
889331_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Cost is principally determined using the first -in, first -out method.
889331_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.

889331_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	For the seven reporting units with goodwill, the Company compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
889331_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	The results of the goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017 indicated that the estimated fair values for each of the seven reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values.
889331_18_ITEM8_P37_S3	As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 1, 2017, the Company noted that the excess of fair value over the carrying value, was 161%, 314%, 247%, 218%, 100%, 25%, and 248% for its reporting units; Electronics (non-silicon), Electronics (silicon), Passenger Car, Commercial Vehicle Products, Sensors, Relays, and Power Fuse, respectively.
889331_18_ITEM8_P37_S4	Relatively small changes in the Company s key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test.

889331_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit.
889331_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit s operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year s annual impairment test.
889331_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events.
889331_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	Based on the interim assessments as of December 30, 2017, management concluded that no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying value.

889331_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows.
889331_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets, that are held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell.
889331_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges totaling $6.0 million, of which $2.2 million related to the impairment of certain customer relationship intangible assets in the customs reporting unit within the Industrial segment and $3.8 million related to the impairment of the Custom Products tradename.
889331_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	The impairment of the customer relationship intangible assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue to be derived from those relationships while the tradename impairment resulted from lower expectations of future cash flows of the customs reporting unit.
889331_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites.
889331_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred.
889331_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the Company s recorded liability for such claims, the Company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
889331_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company records annual income and expense amounts relating to its pension and post-retirement benefits plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return and compensation increases.
889331_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of the fiscal year-end balance sheet date (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumption based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so.
889331_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but are generally amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
889331_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors.
889331_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete.
889331_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	This generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped (FOB origin) to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured, and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
889331_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer.
889331_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third -party distributors.
889331_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company generally accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements.
889331_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition.
889331_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company s published price lists.
889331_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	The customer is invoiced when the Company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
889331_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Some of the terms of the Company s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced.
889331_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program.
889331_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	This program allows the distributor to debit the Company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
889331_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer.
889331_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	If the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price.
889331_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
889331_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit.

889331_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors.
889331_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the Company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible.
889331_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and past experience.
889331_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	Accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be uncollectible, are written off against the reserve on a case-by-case basis.
889331_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
889331_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
889331_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	However, due to the Company s diverse customer base and lack of credit concentration, the Company does not believe its estimates would be materially impacted by changes in its assumptions.
889331_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred, which amounted to $2.9 million in both 2017 and 2016 and $2.3 million in 2015, respectively, and are included as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses.

889331_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Management, in conjunction with an independent third -party, performs an annual evaluation of the former coal mining operations in order to develop an estimate of the probable future obligations in regard to remediating the dangers (such as a shaft collapse) of abandoned coal mine shafts in the former coal mining operations.
889331_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	Management accrues for costs associated with such remediation efforts based on management s best estimate when such costs are probable and reasonably able to be estimated.
889331_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	The ultimate determination can only be done after respective investigations because the concrete conditions are mostly unknown at this time.
889331_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	The accrual is not discounted as management cannot reasonably estimate when such remediation efforts will take place.
889331_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Other expense (income), net generally consists of interest income, royalties , and non-operating income.
889331_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method.
889331_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
889331_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
889331_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889331_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	U.S. state and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable (and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to an upper-tier non-U.S. entity).
889331_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
889331_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Deferred U.S. income taxes and non-U.S. taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in those non-U.S. subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations.

889331_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company s foreign subsidiaries.
889331_18_ITEM8_P66_S3	Changes in economic and business conditions, non-U.S. or U.S. tax laws, or the Company s financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.
889331_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.

889331_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation commonly referred to as t he Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ).
889331_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Among other things, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, adds base broadening provisions which limit deductions and address excessive international tax planning, imposes a one -time tax (the Toll Charge ) on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and enables repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries free of U.S. federal income tax.
889331_18_ITEM8_P68_S2	Other than the Toll Charge (which is applicable to the Company for 2017 ), the provisions will generally be applicable to the Company in 2018 and beyond.
889331_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	In accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 118, in the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded a charge of $47 million as a provisional reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $49 million for the Toll Charge net of $2 million for other net tax benefits.
889331_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	The Company is continuing to analyze the Tax Act and plans to finalize the estimate within the measurement period outlined in SAB No.118.
889331_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	The final charge may differ from the provisional reasonable estimate if provisions of the Tax Act, and their interaction with other provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, are interpreted differently than interpretations made by the Company in determining the estimate, whether through issuance of administrative guidance, or through further review of the Tax Act by the Company and its advisors.
889331_18_ITEM8_P69_S3	Aside from these interpretation issues, the final charge may differ from the provisional reasonable estimate due to refinements of accumulated non-U.S. earnings and tax pool data.
889331_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	One of the base broadening provisions of the Tax Act is commonly referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income GILTI provisions.
889331_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB staff, the Company has not adopted an accounting policy for GILTI.
889331_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	Thus, the U.S. balance sheet tax accounts, notably deferred taxes, were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions.
889331_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company intends to adopt an accounting policy for GILTI within the measurement period outlined in SAB 118.
889331_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
889331_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
889331_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The Company records the fair value of its available-for-sale securities and pension plan assets on a recurring basis.
889331_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets held and used, long-lived assets held for sale, goodwill and other intangible assets.
889331_18_ITEM8_P74_S3	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt and accounts payable approximate their carrying values.
889331_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The three -tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes valuation methodologies based on the reliability of the inputs, is:
889331_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
889331_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
889331_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
889331_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts for Trade receivables, net and Prepaid expenses and other current assets were made to conform to the 2017 presentation.

889331_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	The adoption of the update did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM8_P80_S4	As a result of the adoption of the update, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
889331_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	Cost is principally determined using the first -in, first -out method.
889331_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	The Company maintains excess and obsolete allowances against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value.
889331_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	These allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 - 09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	The update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as classification in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	The update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S3	The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2017.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S4	As a result of the adoption, on a prospective basis, the Company recognized $2.0 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a discrete item in income tax expense for the year ended December 30, 2017.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S5	Historically, these amounts were recorded as additional paid-in capital.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S6	The Company also elected to apply the change prospectively to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S7	As a result, on a prospective basis, share-based payments will be reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S8	The Company elected not to change its policy on accounting for forfeitures and will continue to estimate a requisite forfeiture rate.
889331_18_ITEM8_P82_S9	Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding requirements had no impact on the results of operations.
889331_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017 - 04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350 ).
889331_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	This ASU modifies the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
889331_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
889331_18_ITEM8_P83_S3	Because the update will eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, it should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment.
889331_18_ITEM8_P83_S4	This ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
889331_18_ITEM8_P83_S5	The ASU did not impact the Company in 2017.

889331_18_ITEM8_P84_S2	The seller and buyer will immediately recognize the current and deferred income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of an asset other than inventory.
889331_18_ITEM8_P84_S3	The tax consequences were previously deferred.
889331_18_ITEM8_P84_S4	The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
889331_18_ITEM8_P84_S5	Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition , and is not expected to have a material impact.

889331_18_ITEM8_P85_S4	As a result of the adoption, on a prospective basis, the Company recognized $2.0 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a discrete item in income tax expense for the year ended December 30, 2017.
889331_18_ITEM8_P85_S5	Historically, these amounts were recorded as additional paid-in capital.
889331_18_ITEM8_P85_S6	The Company also elected to apply the change prospectively to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
889331_18_ITEM8_P85_S7	As a result, on a prospective basis, share-based payments will be reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
889331_18_ITEM8_P85_S8	The Company elected not to change its policy on accounting for forfeitures and will continue to estimate a requisite forfeiture rate.
889331_18_ITEM8_P85_S9	Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding requirements had no impact on the results of operations.

889331_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged.
889331_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
889331_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition, and the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019.
889331_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016 - 02.
889331_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 - 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606 ) which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
889331_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	This ASU provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.
889331_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards.
889331_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015 - 14, which postponed the effective date of ASU No. 2014 - 09 to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted on the original effective date of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
889331_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Company is in the process of finalizing its assessment and the documentation of its evaluation of the new standard.
889331_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	The majority of the Company s revenue arrangements generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised finished goods.
889331_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Based on the Company s evaluation process completed and review of its contracts with customers, the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on ASU 2015 - 14 is consistent with its revenue recognition policy under previous guidance.
889331_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	The Company adopted the new standard effective December 31, 2017, using the modified retrospective approach, and will expand its consolidated financial statement disclosures in order to comply with the ASU.
889331_18_ITEM8_P91_S3	The Company has determined the adoption of ASU 2015 - 14 will not have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.
889331_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition.

889331_18_ITEM8_P94_S2	IXYS stockholders received cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock that the IXYS stockholders would otherwise have been entitled to receive.
889331_18_ITEM8_P94_S3	Additionally, each outstanding option to purchase shares of IXYS common stock granted under an IXYS equity plan were assumed by Littelfuse and converted into an option to acquire (i) a number of shares of Littelfuse common stock equal to the number of shares of IXYS common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by 0.1265, rounded down to the nearest whole share, with (ii) an exercise price per share of Littelfuse common stock equal to the exercise price of such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time divided by 0.1265, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
889331_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	Based on the $207.5 per share opening price of Littelfuse common stock on January 17, 2018, the consideration IXYS stockholders received in exchange of their IXYS common stock in the acquisition had a value of approximately $814.8 million comprised of $380.5 million of cash and $434.2 million of Littelfuse stock.
889331_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	In addition to the consideration transferred related to IXYS common stock, the value of consideration transferred, and included in the purchase price, related to IXYS stock options that were converted to Littelfuse stock options, or cash settled, had a value of approximately $41.7 million.

889331_18_ITEM8_P246_S2	The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss) before interest and taxes, but does not evaluate the operating segments using discrete balance sheet information.
