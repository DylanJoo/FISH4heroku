794619_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation ( American Woodmark or the Company ) manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	American Woodmark was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division.
794619_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	American Woodmark was operated privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a registered public offering of its common stock.
794619_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in approximately 500 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles.
794619_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	Styles vary by design and color from natural wood finishes to low-pressure laminate surfaces.
794619_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	The product offering of stock cabinets includes 83 door designs in 18 colors.
794619_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stock cabinets consist of a common box with standard interior components and a maple, oak, cherry, or hickory front frame, door and/or drawer front.
794619_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Products are primarily sold under the brand names of American Woodmark , Timberlake , Shenandoah Cabinetry , Potomac , and Waypoint Living Spaces .
794619_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	American Woodmark s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company services these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of nine service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.
794619_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company distributes its products to each market channel directly from four assembly plants through a third party logistics network.
794619_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	The primary raw materials used include hard maple, oak, cherry, soft maple, and hickory lumber and plywood.
794619_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, manufactured components, and hardware.
794619_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company currently purchases paint from one supplier; however, other sources are available.
794619_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	Other raw materials are purchased from more than one source and are readily available.
794619_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers.
794619_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality.
794619_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.
794619_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	General economic forces and changes in the Company s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material.
794619_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage.
794619_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio below 15%, and working capital exclusive of cash of less than 6% of net sales.
794619_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	At April 30, 2011, debt to capital was 13.8%, and working capital net of cash was 3.1% of net sales.
794619_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	During the last fiscal year, American Woodmark had two primary customers, The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc., which together accounted for approximately 73% of the Company s sales in its fiscal year ended April 30, 2011 (fiscal 2011).
794619_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
794619_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	As of May 31, 2011, the Company had 3,693 employees.
794619_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Approximately 10% of the Company s employees are represented by labor unions.
794619_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Company believes that its employee relations are good.
794619_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	American Woodmark s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the Company s web site at www.americanwoodmark.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
794619_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	The contents of the Company s web site are not, however, part of this report.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the business.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in this report, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings Forward-Looking Statements, Market Risks, and Outlook for Fiscal 2012 .
794619_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business relies on remodeling activity and residential construction.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The Company s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our future financial performance depends in part on the success of our new product development and other growth strategies.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus solely on organic growth.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Consequently, the Company s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The loss of, or a reduction in business from, either of our key customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The size and importance to the Company of its two largest customers is significant.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc. were approximately 73% of total company sales for fiscal 2011.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Although builders, dealers, and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Because the Company is dependent on outside suppliers for raw material needs, it must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from its suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to inflation and increasing costs.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The economic recession is adversely impacting demand for the housing industry.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Through fiscal year 2011, the Company s sales levels have fallen by 46% from their peak levels in 2006.
794619_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If market conditions continue to decline, the Company s sales, earnings, and cash flow would continue to be adversely impacted.
794619_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	American Woodmark leases its Corporate Office located in Winchester, Virginia.
794619_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition, the Company leases 1 manufacturing facility in Hardy County, West Virginia and owns 10 manufacturing facilities located primarily in the eastern United States.
794619_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also leases 9 primary service centers, 2 satellite service centers, and 3 additional office centers located throughout the United States that support the sale and distribution of products to each market channel.
794619_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	The Company considers its properties suitable for the business and adequate for its needs.
794619_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Primary properties as of April 30, 2011 include:
794619_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition, American Woodmark owns one manufacturing facility that is permanently closed and one facility with operations suspended.
794619_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims, and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company accounts for these loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450.
794619_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible or remote, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	Where no loss estimate range can be made, the Company and its counsel perform a worst-case estimate.
794619_11_ITEM3_P2_S3	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of estimated loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of April 30, 2011.
794619_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	Also see the information under Legal Matters under Note K Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .

794619_11_ITEM5_P1_S3	The determination as to the payment and the amount of any future dividends will be made by the Board of Directors from time to time and will depend on the Company s then-current financial condition, capital requirements, results of operations and any other factors then deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.
794619_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	On August 24, 2007, the Company announced that the Company s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company s common stock.
794619_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	This authorization has no expiration date.

794619_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report.
794619_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	This report contains statements concerning the Company s expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts.
794619_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	In most cases, the reader can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, estimate, forecast, expect, believe, should, could, would, plan, may, or other similar words.

794619_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	In addition, the Company participates in an industry that is subject to rapidly changing conditions and there are numerous factors that could cause the Company to experience a decline in sales and/or earnings or deterioration in financial condition.
794619_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	These include: (1) overall industry demand at reduced levels, (2) economic weakness in a specific channel of distribution, (3) the loss of sales from specific customers due to their loss of market share, bankruptcy or switching to a competitor, (4) a sudden and significant rise in basic raw material costs, (5) a dramatic increase to the cost of diesel fuel and/or transportation related services, (6) the need to respond to price or product initiatives launched by a competitor, (7) the Company s ability to successfully implement initiatives related to increasing market share, new products, maintaining and increasing its sales force and new product displays and (8) sales growth at a rate that outpaces the Company s ability to install new capacity.
794619_11_ITEM7_P2_S6	Additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements is contained in this report, including elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , Item 1A, Risk Factors , and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk .
794619_11_ITEM7_P2_S7	While the Company believes that these risks are manageable and will not adversely impact the long-term performance of the Company, these risks could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition.
794619_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Any forward-looking statement that the Company makes, speaks only as of the date of this report.
794619_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
794619_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	American Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors.
794619_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	At April 30, 2011, the Company operated 11 manufacturing facilities and 9 service centers across the country.
794619_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	During the Company s fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2011 (fiscal 2011), the Company experienced a continuation of difficult housing market conditions that have prevailed since the housing market peaked five years ago.
794619_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Several emerging positive factors were overshadowed by negatives.
794619_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Positive factors included private sector job creation of approximately 1.3 million during the Company s fiscal 2011 and mortgage delinquencies, as reported by the Mortgage Banking Association, reaching their lowest levels in two years.
794619_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Negative factors included Gross Private Residential Fixed Investment, as reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce, declining during the third and fourth calendar quarters of 2010 and first calendar quarter of 2011 and housing starts declining by 17% and 5% during the three- and twelve-month periods ended April 30, 2011, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	In new home construction, housing starts reached a 50-year low of only 554,000 during fiscal 2011, a decline of 74% compared with 2.1 million housing starts in fiscal 2006.
794619_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	In the remodeling market, sales of existing homes during fiscal 2011 were 4.9 million homes, a 10% reduction from the prior year s Federal housing stimulus-aided levels and the median home price of houses sold declined by 2%.
794619_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Although existing home sales levels have stabilized, the combination of declining home prices and elevated unemployment levels have led to relatively weak consumer confidence, causing the Company s overall market to decline by approximately 5% during fiscal 2011, based upon sales reported by the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association.
794619_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Faced with these challenging market conditions, the Company s largest remodeling customers chose to utilize aggressive sales promotions during the fall 2010 and spring 2011 selling seasons to boost sales.
794619_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	These promotions consisted of free products and cash discounts to consumers based upon the amount and/or type of cabinets they purchased.
794619_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company s competitors participated vigorously in these promotional activities and the Company chose to meet these competitive offerings.
794619_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	Price-conscious consumers responded favorably to these promotional offerings and the Company and its large remodeling customers realized increased sales order volumes.
794619_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	The Company s remodeling sales rose more than 20% in the second half of fiscal 2011 and rose in the low teens for the entire fiscal year.
794619_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company also realized a mid single digit increase in its new construction sales during fiscal 2011, despite the 5% decline in housing starts.
794619_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Management believes this result, combined with the Company s increase in remodeling sales, indicates that the Company realized market share gains in both of its sales channels during fiscal 2011.
794619_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	In the face of these difficult market conditions, the Company s net sales, gross profit, net loss and free cash flow all improved during fiscal 2011.
794619_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Net sales grew by 11%, gross margin grew by 8%, net loss was reduced by 10% and free cash flow (defined as cash from operating activities less cash used for investing activities) improved by nearly $18 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Despite the present housing market downturn, the Company believes that the long-term fundamentals for the American housing industry continue to remain positive, based upon favorable population growth, favorable demographics, job creation and low long-term interest rates.
794619_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Based upon this belief, the Company has continued to invest in improving its operations and its capabilities to service its customers.
794619_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	The Company remains focused on growing its market share and has continued to invest in developing and launching new products and expanding its marketing reach to new customers.
794619_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	During fiscal 2009, the Company announced cost reduction initiatives, including a salaried reduction-in-force, closure of two of its oldest manufacturing plants and suspension of operations in a third plant.
794619_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	These initiatives were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	of the restructuring charges related to these actions were reflected in the Company s results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2011 was 11.7%, down from 12.0% in fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	The slight reduction in the Company s gross margin rate was driven by increased sales promotion costs.
794619_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	These promotions consisted of free products and cash payments to the Company s large remodeling customers based upon the amount and/or type of cabinets purchased.
794619_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Company s competitors participated vigorously in these promotional activities and the Company chose to maintain competitive parity by participating as well.
794619_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company regularly assesses its long-lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred and regularly evaluates its deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary.
794619_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Although the Company is presently operating at a loss in what appears to be the bottom of the housing market, the Company expects that improvements in market demand and continued market share gains will enable it to return to profitability well before the expiration of the useful lives of its long-lived assets and any applicable tax carryforward periods.
794619_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Accordingly, the Company has concluded that neither its long-lived assets pertaining to its 11 manufacturing plants nor any of its other long-lived assets were impaired and that no valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets was necessary as of April 30, 2011.
794619_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Restructuring charges recorded in connection with the Company s cost reduction initiatives aggregated $(0.0) million net of tax in fiscal 2011, $(1.7) million net of tax in fiscal 2010 and $(6.0) million net of tax in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Exclusive of these charges, the Company generated a net loss of $(20.0) million in fiscal 2011, $(20.6) million in fiscal 2010 and net income of $2.8 million in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net sales were $452.6 million in fiscal 2011, an increase of $46.0 million, or 11%, compared with fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2011 was 8% higher than in fiscal 2010, driven primarily by the Company s increased market share.
794619_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 3% in fiscal 2011, driven primarily by shifts in product mix.
794619_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2010 decreased 26% to $406.5 million from $545.9 million in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2010 was 23% lower than in fiscal 2009, driven primarily by weaker remodeling sales volume.
794619_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Average revenue per unit decreased 3% during fiscal 2010, driven primarily by an increased proportion of new construction sales within the Company s sales mix.
794619_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 11.7% in fiscal 2011 as compared with 12.0% in fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	increased sales promotion costs, diesel fuel and material costs.
794619_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Sales promotion costs increased in order to meet competitors promotional offerings to drive sales growth in a challenging market.
794619_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Most of the sales promotions involved the use of free products or cash reimbursements back to the Company s large retail customers and were deducted from gross margin as opposed to being classified as operating expenses.
794619_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Labor and overhead costs decreased by 3.0% as a percentage of net sales compared with the prior fiscal year, as increased sales volume caused increased productivity of direct labor and absorption of fixed overhead costs.
794619_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	During fiscal 2010, the Company s gross profit declined as a percentage of net sales from 16.4% to 12.0%.
794619_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	The impact of reduced sales volume in fiscal 2010 created inefficiencies from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead and in labor productivity, which more than offset the beneficial impact of reduced overhead costs related to plant closures, reduction in diesel fuel and material costs and the impact of a $1.3 million insurance recovery.
794619_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Labor and overhead costs increased by 5.2% as a percentage of net sales compared with the prior fiscal year, as the 23% decline in sales volume caused reduced productivity of direct labor and under-absorption of fixed overhead costs that more than offset the $17.9 million reduction in overhead driven by the Company s restructuring initiatives.
794619_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2011 were 13.5% of net sales, compared with 14.0% of net sales in fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The decreased cost as a percent of sales in fiscal 2011 resulted from increased sales levels, which resulted in favorable leverage.
794619_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were 14.0% of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared with 11.0% in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The higher cost as a percent of sales in fiscal 2010 was driven by a 26% reduction in net sales that exceeded the reduction in spending as volume-based reductions in compensation costs were offset in part by increased promotional costs and increased business development activities compared with the prior year.
794619_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 declined by $3.7 million, or 14%, compared with fiscal 2010 and represented 5.0% of net sales, compared with 6.5% of net sales for fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The majority of the decline was related to a reduction in the Company s pay-for-performance variable compensation and reduced bad debt and related costs pertaining to insolvent customers.
794619_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	As of April 30, 2011, the Company had receivables from customers with a higher perceived level of risk aggregating less than $0.1 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 declined by $0.4 million, or 2%, compared with fiscal 2009 and represented 6.5% of net sales, as compared with 4.9% of net sales for fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Declines associated with the Company s pay-for-performance variable compensation program and reduced bad debt expense were partially offset by the absence of a prior fiscal year gain of $0.6 million on the termination of a retiree health care plan.
794619_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	As of April 30, 2010, the Company had receivables from customers with a higher perceived level of risk aggregating $0.1 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company generated a pre-tax loss of $30.0 million during fiscal 2011.
794619_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Based upon statutory tax rates in effect and the impact of permanent tax differences for meals and entertainment, a tax basis adjustment and other permanent differences, the Company s effective tax rate was 33.2%.
794619_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company s effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 39.7%, reflecting the impact of statutory tax rates in effect during the years to which the pre-tax loss was carried back, combined with permanent tax differences for general business credits and the domestic production deduction.
794619_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company follows several indices, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence that it believes are near-term leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company believes that while these indicators collectively suggest the long-term economic outlook for housing is positive, the near-term outlook remains subdued.
794619_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company expects that the economic recovery will continue at roughly its current pace and that new job creation will average approximately 200,000 per month during its fiscal 2012.
794619_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	This in turn should translate into a gradual improvement in consumer confidence and enable the remodeling market to be roughly neutral to slightly positive compared with prior year levels, as the benefits from increased employment continue to be hampered by uncertain home prices and credit availability.
794619_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company believes momentum from improving employment will result in improvement in new household formation from its recent low levels.
794619_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	This in turn should help improve housing starts by approximately 10%, to a range of 600,000 to 625,000 during fiscal 2012.
794619_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company expects that it will maintain the market share gains it has made, enabling it to generate sales growth of approximately 5% to 8%.
794619_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Company plans to increase its capital expenditures from $8.5 million in fiscal 2011 to approximately $15 million in fiscal 2012, driven by increasing the number of sales display units deployed with customers and deploying machinery and equipment to enable production volume to increase.
794619_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company expects that its operating cash flow may decline, driven by a decline in the amount of expected income tax refunds and increased working capital requirements as the Company s sales grow.
794619_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company also expects it will experience inflationary pressures in lumber, plywood and various other materials that could negatively impact profitability during fiscal 2012.
794619_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including under Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , under Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk .
794619_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $69.8 million at April 30, 2011, which represented an increase of $2.2 million from April 30, 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Total debt was $25.6 million at April 30, 2011, $0.9 million lower than in the prior fiscal year and long-term debt, excluding current maturities, to capital was 13.8% at April 30, 2011, up from 12.7% at April 30, 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company maintains a $35 million secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. (Wells Fargo).
794619_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Wells Fargo credit facility, at April 30, 2011, $14.4 million of the Company s cash served as security for borrowings under this facility and was classified as restricted cash.
794619_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities.
794619_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Primarily because of its non-cash operating expenses that are included in net income, the Company s cash provided by operating activities has historically been considerably higher than the Company s net income.
794619_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	During the three-year period ended April 30, 2011, the Company generated a total of $61.3 million in cash from operating activities, as compared with a cumulative net loss during this period of $45.6 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	Of the $105.5 million difference between these two amounts, $105.9 million related to non-cash depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense.
794619_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was $13.2 million, compared with $1.3 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The $11.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the $2.3 million decrease in net loss, proceeds of $8.8 million collected from income tax refunds and the absence of payments made in relation to the Company s cost reduction initiatives in the prior year of approximately $9 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Partially offsetting these improvements were declines in the amount of non-cash depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense of $4.6 million and an increase in the Company s net working capital investment in inventory and customer receivable levels of $9.8 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was $1.3 million, compared with $46.8 million in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The significant reduction in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the $19.1 million increase in net loss, payments of previously accrued restructuring charges and severance costs of approximately $9 million, the building of an income tax benefit, of which nearly $9 million was collected during fiscal 2011 and declines in the amount of non-cash depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense of $4.7 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company s net working capital contribution from changes in inventory and customer receivables was $4.6 million less favorable in fiscal 2010, offset by the Company s utilization of pension credits that avoided the requirement to fund pension plan contributions of $5.0 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company s investing activities consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays.
794619_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Net cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2011 was $5.5 million, compared with $11.5 million in fiscal 2010 and $13.8 million in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	Investments in property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2011 were $5.0 million, compared with $2.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $4.8 million in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P43_S3	Investments in promotional displays were $3.5 million in fiscal 2011, compared with $8.7 million in fiscal 2010 and $9.0 million in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	During fiscal 2011, the Company increased its investments in capital expenditures by $2.1 million and reduced its investment in promotional displays by $5.2 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company also received proceeds of $2.9 million during fiscal 2011 from the sale of two previously closed manufacturing plants.
794619_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Capital expenditures rose in fiscal 2011 as the Company began to deploy machinery and equipment to facilitate increased production levels, while reductions in customers new store growth and store re-merchandising activities caused the Company to reduce its investment in promotional displays.
794619_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company s financing activities typically consist of returning a portion of its free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities) to its shareholders, repaying debt and satisfying its other credit obligations, net of any proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.
794619_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company generated free cash flow of $7.7 million in fiscal 2011, which represented an increase of $17.9 million compared with fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	considerably less than the $19.4 million used for financing activities in fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	The primary financing activity use of cash in fiscal 2011 was $5.1 million to pay dividends to the Company s common stockholders.
794619_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company generated negative free cash flow of $10.2 million in fiscal 2010 and used $19.4 million for financing activities, including $14.4 million to serve as security in the form of restricted cash for the Company s credit facility with Wells Fargo and $5.1 million to pay dividends.
794619_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company generated $33.0 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2009 and chose to build its cash balance by $25.9 million to create additional financial flexibility, using $7.2 million for financing activities, including $5.1 million to pay dividends and $2.5 million to repurchase stock.
794619_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Under a stock repurchase authorization approved by its Board of Directors in 2007, the Company is authorized to repurchase its common stock from time to time, when management believes the Company s liquidity and expected cash flows are ample and the market price for its common stock presents an attractive return on investment for its shareholders.
794619_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	At April 30, 2011, approximately $93.3 million remained authorized by the Company s Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock.
794619_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Company has purchased a total of 4.3 million shares of its common stock, for $126.7 million, since 2001.
794619_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Company made no stock repurchases in fiscal 2010 or 2011.
794619_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company can borrow up to $35 million under the Wells Fargo credit facility; however, the Company s aggregate debt with Wells Fargo cannot exceed the collateral value of the Company s cash and specified investments held in accounts pledged to Wells Fargo.
794619_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	At April 30, 2011, $10 million of loans and $3.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Wells Fargo facility and $14.4 million of the Company s cash was held as security.
794619_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Under the terms of the Wells Fargo credit facility, the Company must maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth not greater than 0.9 to 1.0 and must comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants.
794619_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at April 30, 2011 was 0.7 to 1.0.
794619_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The credit facility does not limit the Company s ability to use unrestricted cash to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the Company maintains the required ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth.
794619_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	As of April 30, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the credit facility.
794619_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal 2012.
794619_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	The timing of the Company s contractual obligations as of April 30, 2011 is summarized in the table below:
794619_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the Company s primary loan agreement, term loans and capitalized lease agreements.
794619_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Amounts outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility, $10 million at April 30, 2011, bears a variable interest rate determined by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.25%.
794619_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Interest under the Company s term loans and capitalized lease agreements is fixed at rates between 2% and 6%.
794619_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt for the Company s revolving credit facility are at LIBOR plus the spread as of April 30, 2011, throughout the remaining term of the facility.
794619_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The estimated cost of the Company s two defined benefit pension plans is determined annually based upon the discount rate and other assumptions at fiscal year end.
794619_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Future pension funding contributions beyond 2016 have not been determined at this time.
794619_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	As of April 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
794619_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the Company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported.
794619_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
794619_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
794619_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	For purposes of assessing if impairment exists, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
794619_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	To determine whether an impairment has occurred, the Company compares estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying values.
794619_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	The Company has not recognized impairments of long-lived assets in the last three years.
794619_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
794619_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability.
794619_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit total exposure.
794619_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company establishes a liability at the balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of the Company s employees.
794619_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	The estimated cost, benefits and pension obligation of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations and the future rate of compensation level increases.
794619_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	In fiscal 2011, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve.
794619_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	Previously, the Company referred to the AON Yield Curve in establishing the discount rate.
794619_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach more accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	The future rate of compensation levels reflects expected compensation trends.
794619_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical 1% change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate, rate of compensation, expected return on plan assets and consumer price index:
794619_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2011 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note H of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	At April 30, 2011, the discount rate was 5.66% compared to 5.91% at April 30, 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The expected return on plan assets is 8.0%, which is consistent with fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	The assumed rate of increase in compensation levels is 4.0% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011, unchanged from the prior fiscal year.
794619_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have been as a result of the changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Under accounting guidelines, the discount rate is to be set to market at each annual measurement date.
794619_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	From the fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 7.16% to 5.91%, which was the primary driver in an actuarial loss of $21.3 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	From the fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 5.91% to 5.66%, which was the primary driver in the actuarial loss of $4.5 million.
794619_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average future working lifetime of the plans active participants.
794619_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees were 11.9%, 21.5% and (16.8)% for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2011 was $83.3 million compared to $78.4 million at April 30, 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	The Company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by $36.7 million in fiscal 2011 and $29.1 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	The Company s $7.7 million increase in its net under-funded position during fiscal 2011 was driven by the Company s $4.5 million actuarial losses due to the decrease in the discount rate used and a $4.7 million loss due to additional benefits accruing, offset in part by a higher actual return on plan assets than expected.
794619_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	The Company expects its pension expense to increase from $6.9 million in fiscal 2011 to $7.4 million in fiscal 2012, due primarily to a further decrease in the discount rate offset by a higher return on plan assets than expected.
794619_11_ITEM7_P76_S4	The Company expects to contribute $2.9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2012, which represents both required and discretionary funding.
794619_11_ITEM7_P76_S5	Under the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Company was not required to make mandatory contributions to its pension plans in either fiscal 2011 or in fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company invests in promotional displays in retail stores to demonstrate product features, product specifications, quality specifications and serve as a training tool for designers.
794619_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	The investment is carried at cost less applicable amortization.
794619_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Amortization is provided by the straight-line method on an individual display basis over the estimated period of economic benefit, approximately 30 to 36 months.
794619_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Company believes that the estimated period of economic benefit provides an accurate reflection of the value of displays as of the date of the balance sheet based on historical experience.
794619_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.
794619_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the Company s remaining obligation based on anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.
794619_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates.
794619_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Warranty claims are generally made within three months of the original shipment date.
794619_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	The calculation of stock-based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment.
794619_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	These estimates include the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit award granted.
794619_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Stock option awards are estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
794619_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	There are two significant inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model: expected volatility and expected term.
794619_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	The Company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	The expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the Company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding.
794619_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	For performance-based restricted stock units, the Company estimates the number of shares that will be granted upon satisfaction of the performance conditions, based upon actual and expected future operating results.
794619_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant management judgment.
794619_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	As a result, if factors change or the Company uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
794619_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
794619_11_ITEM7_P83_S4	If the Company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.
794619_11_ITEM7_P83_S5	See Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on stock-based compensation.

794619_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Company considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining the need for a valuation allowance.
794619_11_ITEM7_P84_S4	Based upon this analysis, including a consideration of recent losses, management determined that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized through expected future income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.
794619_11_ITEM7_P84_S5	The Company will continue to update this analysis on a periodic basis and changes in expectations about future income or the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences could cause the Company to record a valuation allowance in a future period.
794619_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements .

794619_11_ITEM8_P39_S4	The Company estimated the forfeiture rates based upon its historical experience.
794619_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	At April 30, 2011, the Company had stock option and RSU awards outstanding under three different plans: (1) 1999 stock option plan for employees, (2) 2004 stock incentive plan for employees and (3) 2006 non-employee directors equity ownership plan.

794619_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	For purposes of valuing stock option grants, the Company has identified two employee groups and one non-employee director group, based upon observed option exercise patterns.
794619_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the Company s stock options for each of the three groups.
794619_11_ITEM8_P41_S2	Using this option-pricing model, the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant.
794619_11_ITEM8_P41_S3	The fair value of the Company s stock option awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock options.
794619_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	The expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from the Company s historical exercise experience and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding for each of the three identified groups.
794619_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	The expected term assumption incorporates the contractual term of an option grant, which is generally ten years for employees and from four years to ten years for non-employee directors, as well as the vesting period of an award, which is typically three years.
794619_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	For purposes of determining the fair value of RSUs, the Company uses the closing stock price of its common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant, reduced by the discounted value of future expected dividend payments during the vesting period, since the recipients are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
794619_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The fair value of the Company s RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the RSUs to the extent the Company believes it is probable the related performance criteria, if any, will be met.
794619_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the vesting period of the RSU grant.
794619_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	The weighted-average assumptions and valuation of the Company s stock options were as follows:
794619_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	Stock options granted and outstanding under each of the Company s plans vest evenly over a three-year period and have contractual terms ranging from four to ten years.
794619_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	The exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the option grant date.
794619_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	The following table presents a summary of the Company s stock option activity for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (remaining contractual term [in years] and exercise prices are weighted-averages):
794619_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the previous table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2011 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) of the shares of the Company s common stock that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on April 30, 2011.
794619_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	This amount changes based upon the fair market value of the Company s common stock.
794619_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	The total fair value of options vested for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $3.3 million, $4.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	As of April 30, 2011, there was $1.5 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under the Company s stock-based compensation plans.

794619_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Cash received from option exercises for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was an aggregate of $0.4 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises of stock option awards totaled $84,000, $215,000 and $12,000, for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at April 30, 2011 (remaining lives [in years] and exercise prices are weighted-averages):
794619_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company s RSUs granted to employees cliff-vest over a three-year period from date of grant, while RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest daily over a two-year period from date of grant.
794619_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Directors were granted service-based RSUs only, while employees were awarded both service-based and performance-based RSUs (PBRSUs) in fiscal years 2011 and 2010.
794619_11_ITEM8_P53_S2	The PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2011 contain a number of criteria pertaining to the Company s operational and financial performance during the performance period of fiscal 2011.
794619_11_ITEM8_P53_S3	Employees who satisfy the vesting criteria will receive a proportional amount of PBRSUs based upon the Compensation Committee s assessment of the Company s achievement against the performance criteria.

794619_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	As of April 30, 2011, there was $2.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs granted under the Company s stock-based compensation plans.
794619_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.
794619_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 stock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows:
794619_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	In fiscal 1990, the Company instituted the American Woodmark Investment Savings Stock Ownership Plan.
794619_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	Under this plan, all employees who are at least18 years old and have been employed by the Company for at least six consecutive months are eligible to receive Company stock through a profit-sharing contribution and a 401(k) matching contribution based upon the employee's contribution to the plan.
794619_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	Profit-sharing contributions in the form of Company stock are 3% of after-tax earnings, calculated on a quarterly basis and are distributed equally to all employees eligible to participate in the plan.
794619_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	The Company did not recognize any expenses for profit-sharing contributions in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 and recognized expenses of $5,000 in fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company matches 401(k) contributions in the form of Company stock at 50% of an employee's annual contribution to the plan up to 4% of base earnings for an effective maximum Company contribution of 2% of base earnings.
794619_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	The expense for 401(k) matching contributions for this plan was $1,272,000, $1,284,000 and $1,505,000, in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering virtually all of the Company s employees.
794619_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	These plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average earnings (for salaried employees) or benefit rate (for hourly employees).
794619_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at April 30, 2011 is $36.0 million ($21.9 million net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension benefit costs.
794619_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company expects to recognize $2.2 million ($1.3 million net of tax) in net actuarial losses and prior service costs in net periodic pension benefit costs during fiscal 2012.
794619_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company uses an April 30 measurement date for its benefit plans.
794619_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company s non-contributory defined benefit pension plans as of April 30:
794619_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans were $106,600,000 and $95,331,000 at April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	Actuarial Assumptions : The discount rate at April 30 was used to measure the year-end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year.
794619_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and earnings effects for principal pension plans follow:
794619_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	In fiscal 2011, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve.
794619_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	In fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the Company referred to the AON Yield Curve in establishing the discount rate.
794619_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions.
794619_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Company also considered the related historical ten-year average asset returns at April 30, 2011.
794619_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company amortizes experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, over a period no longer than the average future working lifetime of the active participants.
794619_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Contributions: The Company funds the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts the Company deems appropriate.
794619_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company expects to contribute $2.9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2012, which represents both required and discretionary funding.
794619_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Company was not required to make, and did not make, any contributions to the pension plans in either fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Estimated Future Benefit Payments : The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid:
794619_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Plan Assets: Pension assets by major category of plan assets and the type of fair value measurement as of April 30, 2011 and 2010 are presented in the following table:
794619_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with its pension plans.
794619_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	The objectives of the investment strategies include preservation of capital and long-term growth of capital while avoiding excessive risk.
794619_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by the Pension Committee.
794619_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and occasionally the Pension Committee will approve allocations above or below a target range.
794619_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	During a period of uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets, the Pension Committee may suspend the Target Asset Allocation and manage the investment mix as it sees reasonable, prudent and in the best interest of the plans to better protect the value of the plan assets.
794619_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company s pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at April 30, 2011 and 2010, by asset category, were as follows:
794619_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	Within the broad categories outlined in the preceding table, the Company has targeted the following specific allocations as a percentage of total funds invested: 21% Capital Preservation, 28% Bond, 21% Large Capital Growth, 20% Large Capital Value, 6% Small Capital and 4% International.
794619_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	Income tax expense was comprised of the following:
794619_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company's effective income tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate as follows:
794619_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	Income taxes paid were $235,000, $309,000 and $1,494,000 for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
794619_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	Included in the net operating loss carryforward is a federal net operating loss carryforward of $2.0 million which expires on April 30, 2031 and state net operating loss carryforwards with various expiration dates.
794619_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its gross deferred tax assets due to expected future income and reversal of taxable temporary differences.
794619_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	At April 30, 2011, the Company has recorded income taxes receivable of $2.1 million for federal and state refund claims.
794619_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company accounts for its income tax uncertainties in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes .
794619_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Company had no liability relating to uncertain tax positions for the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010.
794619_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	With minor exceptions, the Company is currently open to audit by tax authorities for tax years ending April 30, 2008 through April 30, 2010.
794619_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Company is currently not under federal audit.
794619_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims, and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	The Company accounts for these loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450.
794619_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible or remote, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_11_ITEM8_P89_S2	Where no loss estimate range can be made, the Company and its counsel perform a worst-case estimate.
794619_11_ITEM8_P89_S3	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible were not material as of April 30, 2011.
794619_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.
794619_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.
794619_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates.
794619_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	Warranty claims are generally made within three months of the original shipment date.
794619_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the Company s warranty liability:
794619_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	The Company leases certain office buildings, manufacturing buildings, service centers and equipment.
794619_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	Total rental expenses under operating leases amounted to approximately $7,518,000, $7,514,000 and $8,207,000, in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

794619_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	During fiscal 1985, prior to becoming a publicly held corporation, the Company entered into an agreement with a partnership which includes certain former executive officers and current significant shareholders of the Company, including one current member of the Board of Directors of the Company, to lease the Company s headquarters building, which was constructed and is owned by the partnership.
794619_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	The Company has subsequently renewed this lease in accordance with Company policy and procedures which includes approval by the Board of Directors.
794619_11_ITEM8_P96_S2	As of April 30, 2011, the Company is in the first year of the latest five-year renewal period.
794619_11_ITEM8_P96_S3	Under this agreement, rental expense was $460,000, $455,000 and $454,000, in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P96_S4	Rent during the remaining term of approximately $2,317,000 (included in the preceding table) is subject to annual increases of 2% beginning with the third year of the lease.
794619_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition and generally collateral is not required.

794619_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for bad debt based upon management's evaluation and judgment of potential net loss.
794619_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	The allowance is estimated based upon historical experience, the effects of current developments and economic conditions and of customers' current and anticipated financial condition.
794619_11_ITEM8_P99_S2	Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated.

794619_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company utilizes the hierarchy of fair value measurements to classify its assets based upon the following definitions:
794619_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	Level 1 Investments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
794619_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	The Company s cash equivalents are invested in money market funds, mutual funds and United States Treasury instruments.

794619_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company announced a restructuring plan to close two of its manufacturing plants, located in Berryville, Virginia and Moorefield, West Virginia and suspend operations in a third manufacturing plant located in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.
794619_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	These actions were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
794619_11_ITEM8_P108_S2	This initiative impacted approximately 600 employees.
794619_11_ITEM8_P108_S3	The continued housing slump, at that time, led to the decision to reduce production capacity.
794619_11_ITEM8_P108_S4	These initiatives were intended to increase the Company s utilization rates and decrease overhead costs within the Company s manufacturing operations.
794619_11_ITEM8_P108_S5	In addition to these initiatives, the Company made other staffing reductions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
794619_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized pre-tax restructuring charges of $62,000, $2.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively.
794619_11_ITEM8_P109_S1	The Company recognized recurring operating costs for the closed facilities of $0.9 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_11_ITEM8_P109_S2	These costs will continue until the remaining closed plant is sold and the new plan for the suspended plant is determined.
794619_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	Of the three manufacturing plants idled in 2009, one of the closed plants has been sold and one is classified as held for sale and included in Other Assets on the Company s balance sheet at April 30, 2011.
794619_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	The Company believes that the $0.4 million net book value of this plant is fully recoverable.
794619_11_ITEM8_P110_S2	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company sold its closed plant located in Berryville, Virginia and recognized a $0.9 million gain on the sale.
794619_11_ITEM8_P110_S3	The gain was recorded as Other Income.
794619_11_ITEM8_P110_S4	The Company has not yet determined how its idled manufacturing plant in Tahlequah, Oklahoma will be utilized in the future.
794619_11_ITEM8_P110_S5	Accordingly, the $4.6 million net book value for this asset continues to be classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the Company s balance sheet at April 30, 2011 and continues to be depreciated at a rate of $0.5 million per year.
794619_11_ITEM8_P110_S6	The Company expects it may incur approximately $1.5 million in additional restructuring charges relating to management s estimate of shortfall in fair value of the idled Tahlequah plant for which future utilization plans have not been determined.

794619_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
794619_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation ( American Woodmark or the Company ) manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	American Woodmark was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division.
794619_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	American Woodmark was operated privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a registered public offering of its common stock.
794619_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in approximately 550 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles.
794619_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Styles vary by design and color from natural wood finishes to low-pressure laminate surfaces.
794619_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	The product offering of stock cabinets includes 86 door designs in 18 colors.
794619_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stock cabinets consist of a common box with standard interior components and a maple, oak, cherry, or hickory front frame, door and/or drawer front.
794619_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Products are primarily sold under the brand names of American Woodmark , Timberlake , Shenandoah Cabinetry , Potomac , and Waypoint Living Spaces .
794619_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	American Woodmark s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company services these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of nine service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.
794619_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company distributes its products to each market channel directly from four assembly plants through a third party logistics network.
794619_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	The primary raw materials used include hard maple, oak, cherry, soft maple, and hickory lumber and plywood.
794619_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, manufactured components, and hardware.
794619_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company currently purchases paint from one supplier; however, other sources are available.
794619_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	Other raw materials are purchased from more than one source and are readily available.
794619_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers.
794619_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality.
794619_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.
794619_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	General economic forces and changes in the Company s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material.
794619_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage.
794619_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio of well below 20%, and working capital exclusive of cash of less than 6% of net sales.
794619_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	At April 30, 2012, debt to capital was 15.5%, and working capital net of cash was 1.0% of net sales.
794619_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	During the last fiscal year, American Woodmark had two primary customers, The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc., which together accounted for approximately 68% of the Company s sales in its fiscal year ended April 30, 2012 (fiscal 2012).
794619_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
794619_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	As of May 31, 2012, the Company had 3,791 employees.
794619_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Less than 1% of the Company s employees are represented by labor unions.
794619_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Company believes that its employee relations are good.
794619_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	American Woodmark s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the Company s web site at www.americanwoodmark.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
794619_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	The contents of the Company s web site are not, however, part of this report.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or currently believed to be immaterial also may adversely impact the business.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings Forward-Looking Statements, Market Risks, and Outlook for Fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company s business is dependent upon remodeling activity and residential construction.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The Company s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Prolonged economic downturns may adversely impact the Company s sales, earnings and liquidity.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through fiscal year 2012, the Company s sales levels have fallen 38% from their peak levels in 2006.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company s industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles, including the current housing downturn.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During economic downturns, the Company s industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The Company believes that its industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors not only may affect the ultimate consumer of the Company s products, but also may impact home centers, builders and the Company s other primary customers.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, a continuation or worsening of current conditions could adversely affect the Company s sales and earnings as well as its cash flow and liquidity.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company s future financial performance depends in part on the success of its new product development and other growth strategies.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus solely on organic growth.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, the Company s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The loss of, or a reduction in business from, either of the Company s key customers would have a material adverse effect upon its business.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The size and importance to the Company of its two largest customers is significant.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc. were approximately 68% of total company sales for fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although builders, dealers, and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Manufacturing realignments and cost savings programs similar to the Company s 2012 Restructuring Plan could result in a decrease in the Company s near-term earnings and liquidity.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company continually reviews its manufacturing operations.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These reviews could result in manufacturing realignments and cost savings programs, such as the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems, or procedures, which in turn could result in a charge that would decrease near-term earnings and liquidity until the expected cost reductions are achieved.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any such realignments would likely result in significant costs including, among others, severance, impairment, exit, and disposal costs and capital expenditures.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Impairment charges could reduce the Company s profitability.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company has significant long-lived assets, including deferred tax assets, recorded on its balance sheets.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If operating results decline or if the Company decides to restructure results as it did with the 2012 Restructuring Plan, the Company could incur impairment charges, which could have a material impact on its financial results.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets on an ongoing basis.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The outcome of future reviews could result in substantial impairment charges.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment assessments inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about market conditions and the Company s ability to generate future cash flows and profitability, given those assumptions.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Future events and changing market conditions may impact the Company s assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may result in changes in the Company s estimates.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although the Company believes the assumptions used in testing for impairment are reasonable, significant changes in these assumptions could produce a significantly different result.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company s operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Because the Company is dependent on outside suppliers for raw material needs, it must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from its suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to inflation and increasing costs.
794619_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.
794619_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	American Woodmark leases its Corporate Office located in Winchester, Virginia.
794619_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition, the Company leases 1 manufacturing facility in Hardy County, West Virginia and owns 8 manufacturing facilities located primarily in the eastern United States.
794619_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also leases 9 primary service centers, 2 satellite service centers, and 3 additional office centers located throughout the United States that support the sale and distribution of products to each market channel.
794619_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The Company considers its properties suitable for the business and adequate for its needs.
794619_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Primary properties as of April 30, 2012 include:
794619_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition, American Woodmark owns three manufacturing facilities that are permanently closed.
794619_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company accounts for these loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450.
794619_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible or remote, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	Where no loss estimate range can be made, the Company and its counsel perform a worst-case estimate.
794619_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of estimated loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of April 30, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	Also see the information under Legal Matters under Note K Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

794619_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company did not repurchase any shares under this authorization.
794619_12_ITEM5_P2_S3	At April 30, 2012, $93.3 million remained authorized by the Company s Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock.
794619_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following table sets forth certain income and expense items as a percentage of net sales:
794619_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Five-Year Selected Financial Information and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes contained elsewhere herein.
794619_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	This report contains statements concerning the Company s expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts.
794619_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

794619_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	Forward-looking statements contained in this annual report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis, are based on current expectations and our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	In addition, the Company participates in an industry that is subject to rapidly changing conditions and there are numerous factors that could cause the Company to experience a decline in sales and/or earnings or deterioration in financial condition.
794619_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	These include but are not limited to: (1) general economic or business conditions and instability in the financial and credit markets, including their potential impact on our (i) sales and operating costs and access to financing; and (ii) customers and suppliers and their ability to obtain financing or generate the cash necessary to conduct their respective businesses; (2) the cyclical nature of the Company s industry, which is particularly sensitive to changes in consumer confidence, the amount of consumers income available for discretionary purchases, and the availability and terms of consumer credit; (3) economic weakness in a specific channel of distribution; (4) the loss of sales from specific customers due to their loss of market share, bankruptcy or switching to a competitor; (5) risks associated with domestic manufacturing operations, including fluctuations in capacity utilization and the prices and availability of key raw materials as well as fuel, transportation, warehousing and labor costs and environmental compliance and remediation costs; (6) the need to respond to price or product initiatives launched by a competitor; (7) the Company s ability to successfully implement initiatives related to increasing market share, new products, maintaining and increasing its sales force and new product displays; and (8) sales growth at a rate that outpaces the Company s ability to install new capacity or a sales decline that requires reduction or realignment of the Company s manufacturing capacity.
794619_12_ITEM7_P2_S6	Additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements is contained in this report, including elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis and also in the Company s most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
794619_12_ITEM7_P2_S7	While the Company believes that these risks are manageable and will not adversely impact the long-term performance of the Company, these risks could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition.
794619_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Any forward-looking statement that the Company makes speaks only as of the date of this report.
794619_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
794619_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	American Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors.
794619_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	At April 30, 2012, the Company operated 9 manufacturing facilities and 9 service centers across the country.
794619_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	During the Company s fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2012 (fiscal 2012), the Company experienced a continuation of difficult housing market conditions that have prevailed since the housing market peaked in 2006, although the outlook has begun to trend more positively.
794619_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Increases in total housing starts and single family housing starts during the Company s fiscal 2012 of 17% and 4%, respectively, as compared to the Company s fiscal 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
794619_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Cabinet sales, as reported by members of the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA), increased by less than 1% during fiscal 2012, inclusive of increased new construction sales and therefore indicative of lower remodeling sales.
794619_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Faced with these challenging market conditions, the Company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize an elevated level of sales promotions in the Company s product category during fiscal 2012 to boost sales.
794619_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	These promotions consisted of free products and cash discounts to consumers based upon the amount and/or type of cabinets they purchased.
794619_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	The Company also continued to participate in these promotional activities in order to remain competitive with competitors promotional offerings which have generally been richer than those offered by the Company.
794619_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Price-conscious consumers generally responded to these promotional offerings, helping the Company to gain market share and realize increased sales volumes in fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company s remodeling sales increased at a mid-single digit pace during fiscal 2012 in a remodeling market that appears to have declined from the prior year.
794619_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Despite market conditions that continue to be well below normal levels, the Company increased its net sales by 14% during fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Company realized strong sales gains in its new construction channel during fiscal 2012, where sales increased by more than 25%, significantly outpacing the improvement in single family housing starts.
794619_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Management believes this result, combined with the Company s increased remodeling sales, indicates the Company realized market share gains in both of its sales channels during fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company announced several initiatives designed to reduce its manufacturing capacity and its cost base, including the permanent closure of two manufacturing plants, the decision to place a previously closed manufacturing facility for sale, and the realignment of its retirement program, including the freezing of its pension plans.
794619_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Restructuring charges related to these actions have been reflected in the Company s results.
794619_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was 12.9%, up from 11.7% in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in the Company s gross margin rate was driven by the beneficial impact of increased sales volume upon direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs, which more than offset the impact of rising materials, freight and sales promotional costs.
794619_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Although the present housing market downturn has continued at historic low levels of market activity, the Company believes that the long-term fundamentals for the American housing industry continue to remain positive, based upon continued population growth, job creation and household formation.
794619_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Based upon this belief, the Company has continued to invest in improving its operations and its capabilities to service its customers.
794619_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company remains focused on growing its market share and has continued to invest in developing and launching new products and expanding its marketing reach to new customers.
794619_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company regularly assesses its long-lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred and regularly evaluates its deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary.
794619_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Although the Company generated an operating loss in fiscal 2012 in what may have been the bottom of the housing market, the Company expects that a combination of continued market share gains and lower costs resulting from its recent restructuring actions will enable it to return to profitability commencing with fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	As a result of its restructuring initiatives, the Company recorded total pre-tax restructuring costs of $16.3 million during fiscal 2012, including a pre-tax impairment charge of $7.9 million related to three of its manufacturing facilities that have been included in restructuring initiatives.
794619_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	The Company has concluded that none of the long-lived assets pertaining to its other 9 remaining manufacturing plants or any of its other long-lived assets were impaired and that no valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets was necessary as of April 30, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Restructuring charges recorded in connection with the Company s cost reduction initiatives aggregated $10.0 million net of tax in fiscal 2012, $0.0 million net of tax in fiscal 2011 and $1.7 million net of tax in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Exclusive of these charges, the Company generated a net loss of $(10.8) million in fiscal 2012, $(20.0) million in fiscal 2011 and $(20.6) million in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net sales were $515.8 million in fiscal 2012, an increase of $63.2 million, or 14%, compared with fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2012 was 9% higher than in fiscal 2011, driven primarily by the Company s increased market share.
794619_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 5% in fiscal 2012, driven by improvements in the Company s product mix.
794619_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased 11% to $452.6 million from $406.5 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2011 was 8% higher than in fiscal 2010, driven primarily by the Company s increased market share.
794619_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 3% during fiscal 2011, driven primarily by shifts in product mix.
794619_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 12.9% in fiscal 2012 as compared with 11.7% in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The impact of increased sales volume in fiscal 2012 created improved labor efficiencies and more favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs, which were partially offset by increased sales promotion costs, material costs and diesel fuel.
794619_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Sales promotion costs increased by 0.7% of net sales during fiscal 2012, as the Company chose to remain competitive with competitors promotional offerings to drive sales growth in a challenging market.
794619_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Sales promotions generally involved the use of free products or cash reimbursements back to the Company s large retail customers and were deducted from gross margin as opposed to being classified as operating expenses.
794619_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	During fiscal 2011, the Company s gross profit declined as a percentage of net sales from 12.0% in fiscal 2010 to 11.7% in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The impact of increased sales volume in fiscal 2011 created improved labor efficiencies and more favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs, which were more than offset by increased sales promotion costs, material costs and diesel fuel.
794619_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Labor and overhead costs improved by 3.0% as a percentage of net sales during fiscal 2011 compared with the prior fiscal year, as increased sales volume caused increased productivity of direct labor and absorption of fixed overhead costs.
794619_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2012 were 11.3% of net sales, compared with 13.5% of net sales in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Selling and marketing costs decreased by 5% in relation to a 14% increase in net sales for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Although the breadth of the Company s fiscal 2012 product launches was similar in scope to those of the prior fiscal year, efficiencies from lower marketing collateral and branding costs, as well as reductions in product display costs more than offset the increases in employee compensation and travel costs incurred by the Company in fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were 13.5% of net sales in fiscal 2011 compared with 14.0% in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The decreased cost as a percent of sales in fiscal 2011 was a result of increased sales levels, which generated favorable cost leverage.
794619_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 increased by $2.6 million, or 12%, compared with fiscal 2011 and represented 4.9% of net sales, compared with 5.0% of net sales for fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The majority of the cost increase was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation.
794619_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 declined by $3.7 million or 14%, compared with fiscal 2010 and represented 5.0% of net sales, as compared with 6.5% of net sales for fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The majority of the decline was related to a reduction in incentive compensation and reduced bad debt and related costs pertaining to insolvent customers.
794619_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	As of both April 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had receivables from customers with a higher perceived level of risk aggregating less than $0.1 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company generated a pre-tax loss of $33.3 million during fiscal 2012, including $16.3 million of restructuring charges.
794619_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company s effective tax rate increased from 33.2% in fiscal 2011 to 37.6% in fiscal 2012, driven primarily by the impact of a tax basis adjustment, changes driven by restructuring charges, and the absence of favorability that occurred in fiscal 2011 relating to a loss carryback.
794619_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company follows several indices, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence that it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Company believes that while these indicators collectively suggest the long-term economic outlook for housing is positive, the near-term outlook for housing remains subdued.
794619_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company expects that the U.S. economy will continue to grow, that job creation will continue, and that the prices for existing homes will finally bottom during fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	For fiscal 2013, the Company expects that the median price of existing homes sold will be flat with that of fiscal 2012, and that industry-wide cabinet remodeling sales will be roughly flat in fiscal 2013 after several years of declines.
794619_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company expects that its remodeling market share will be stable in fiscal 2013 and that its remodeling unit sales will therefore approximate those of fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company expects that single-family housing starts will continue to grow at a mid-single digit rate during fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company grew its new construction market share significantly during fiscal 2012 and expects that it will be able to grow its new construction sales at a high single digit rate in fiscal 2013 in a market that seems poised to grow at a slightly lesser rate.
794619_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements, the Company expects that it will grow its sales at a mid single digit rate in fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company s operating loss exclusive of restructuring charges was $17.0 million in fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The Company expects that the savings realized from its fiscal 2012 restructuring will approximate this amount, creating the ability to break-even absent any sales growth.
794619_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Because of the sales growth that is expected to occur, the Company expects to return to profitability during fiscal 2013, inclusive of expected adverse impacts from a continuing rise in material costs.
794619_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company plans to increase its capital expenditures from $9.9 million in fiscal 2012 to approximately $14 million in fiscal 2013, driven by increasing the number of sales display units deployed with customers and investing in machinery and equipment to enable production volume to increase.
794619_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company expects that its operating cash flow may decline, driven by the elimination of income tax refunds, increased pension plan funding requirements and increased working capital usage as the Company s sales grow.
794619_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including under Forward-Looking Statements, elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis and also in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012 filed with the SEC, under Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
794619_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $73.7 million at April 30, 2012, which represented an increase of $3.9 million from April 30, 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Total debt was $24.7 million at April 30, 2012, $0.9 million lower than in the prior fiscal year and long-term debt, excluding current maturities, to capital was 15.5% at April 30, 2012, up from 13.8% at April 30, 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities.
794619_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company maintains a $35 million secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. (Wells Fargo).
794619_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Wells Fargo credit facility, at April 30, 2012, $7.1 million of the Company s cash served as security for borrowings under this facility and was classified as restricted cash.
794619_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Primarily because of its non-cash operating expenses that are included in net income, the Company s cash provided by operating activities has historically been considerably higher than the Company s net income.
794619_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	During the three-year period ended April 30, 2012, the Company generated a total of $30.5 million in cash from operating activities, as compared with a cumulative net loss during this period of $63.1 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	Of the $93.7 million difference between these two amounts, $92.8 million related to non-cash depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense.
794619_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was $16.1 million, compared with $13.2 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The $2.9 million improvement was primarily attributable to the reduction in the Company s operating loss exclusive of restructuring charges of $13.9 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	This improvement was offset in part by reductions in proceeds from income tax refunds of $7.1 million, from increasing funding to its pension plans of $2.9 million, and from funding restructuring costs of $1.2 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was $13.2 million, compared with $1.3 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The $11.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the $2.3 million decrease in net loss, proceeds of $8.8 million collected from income tax refunds and the absence of payments made in relation to the Company s cost reduction initiatives in the prior fiscal year of approximately $9 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	A $9.8 million increase in the Company s net working capital investment in inventory and customer receivables partially offset these improvements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company s investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays.
794619_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Net cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2012 was $9.9 million, compared with $5.5 million in fiscal 2011 and $11.5 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Investments in property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2012 were $6.7 million, compared with $5.0 million in fiscal 2011 and $2.9 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	Investments in promotional displays were $3.3 million in fiscal 2012, compared with $3.5 million in fiscal 2011 and $8.7 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	During fiscal 2012, the Company s increased investment in capital expenditures was driven by machinery purchases that helped enable the recent plant closures to occur.
794619_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The remainder of the increase in net cash invested during fiscal 2012 was due to the absence of $2.9 million of proceeds received during fiscal 2011 from the sale of two previously closed manufacturing plants.
794619_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company generated positive free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities) of $6.1 million during fiscal 2012, compared with positive $7.7 million in fiscal 2011 and negative $10.2 million in fiscal 2010.
794619_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The reduction in fiscal 2012 was driven by increased net outflows used for investing activities that more than offset net improvements in cash provided by operating activities.
794619_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Exclusive of the adverse change in tax refunds, pension contributions, cash used for restructuring activities and declines due to building sale proceeds, free cash flow generated during fiscal 2012 improved by approximately $14 million compared with fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	The improvement in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 of $17.9 million was primarily driven by the absence of cash paid for restructuring activities aggregating $9 million, coupled with a reduction in net cash used for investing activities of $6 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Company s financing activities have typically consisted of returning a portion of its free cash flow to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and repayments of debt, net of any proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.
794619_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company provided $5.1 million from financing activities in fiscal 2012, compared with using $5.5 million for financing activities in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The primary financing activity that generated cash in fiscal 2012 was the release of $7.4 million of restricted cash previously used to secure the Company s credit facility.
794619_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Company s outflows of $1.0 million to service its debt and $1.3 million to pay dividends served to reduce the net cash flow from financing activities to $5.1 million in fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company used $5.5 million for financing activities in fiscal 2011, including $5.1 million to pay dividends and $0.9 million to service its debt, offset in part by proceeds received from issuance of its common stock.
794619_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Company used $19.4 million for financing activities in fiscal 2010, driven by having $14.4 million of its cash become restricted as security for its credit facility and paying dividends of $5.1 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Despite the Company s strong liquidity and positive free cash flow, the Company s assessment of the U.S. economy and the continued difficulties in the housing market caused it to suspend its dividend and restructure its operations during fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	As a result of these actions, the Company believes that it has the capability to operate profitably, generate satisfactory levels of operating cash flow to fund increased levels of capital expenditures, and still have ample remaining manufacturing capacity to grow its sales revenue by approximately 50% from present levels.
794619_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	To the extent that the Company determines that it is carrying excess cash in relation to its future operational and other needs, then the Company s Board of Directors will consider returning some or all of the excess cash to its shareholders in the form of either stock repurchases or future dividends.
794619_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	The Company is authorized to repurchase its stock under an authorization approved by its Board of Directors in 2007 of up to $93.3 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	The Company made no stock repurchases in fiscal 2011 or 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company can borrow up to $35 million under the Wells Fargo credit facility; however, the Company must maintain cash and specified investments held in accounts pledged to Wells Fargo having a collateral value of at least 50% of the Company s aggregate indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo.
794619_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	At April 30, 2012, $10 million of loans and $3.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Wells Fargo facility and $7.1 million of the Company s cash was held as security.
794619_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	On May 29, 2012, the Company and Wells Fargo amended the credit facility and modified related security arrangements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Effective as of April 26, 2012, the amount of cash and securities required to be held as security was reduced from 100% to 50% of the Company s outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo.
794619_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	As a result, the Company s restricted cash was reduced by $7.4 million to $7.1 million as of the fiscal year end.
794619_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Company also agreed to pledge substantially all of its assets as security for the Company s indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo.
794619_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	Effective as of May 29, 2012, the amendment to the credit facility reduced the allowable ratio of the Company s total liabilities to its tangible net worth to a maximum of 1.4 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter, added a requirement for the Company to maintain a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than 1.25 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis and added a requirement that the Company maintain an asset coverage ratio of not less than 1.47 to 1.0 at the end of each calendar month.
794619_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the amended credit facility as of April 30, 2012, as follows: (1) the Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at April 30, 2012 was 1.0 to 1.0; (2) cash flow to fixed charges for its most recent four quarters was 1.35 to 1.0; and (3) its asset coverage ratio as of April 30, 2012 was 4.89 to 1.0.
794619_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The credit facility does not limit the Company s ability to use unrestricted cash to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the Company is in compliance with these covenants.
794619_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The timing of the Company s contractual obligations as of April 30, 2012 is summarized in the table below:
794619_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	1 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the Company s primary loan agreement, term loans and capitalized lease agreements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Amounts outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility, $10 million at April 30, 2012, bears a variable interest rate determined by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.25%.
794619_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Interest under the Company s term loans and capitalized lease agreements is fixed at rates between 2% and 6.5%.
794619_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt for the Company s revolving credit facility are at LIBOR plus the spread as of April 30, 2012, throughout the remaining term of the facility.
794619_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	2 The estimated cost of the Company s two defined benefit pension plans is determined annually based upon the discount rate and other assumptions at fiscal year end.
794619_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	Future pension funding contributions beyond 2017 have not been determined at this time.
794619_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The costs of the Company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations.
794619_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company has generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases.
794619_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	On April 30, 2012, the Company had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company does not currently use commodity or interest rate derivatives or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price or interest rate risks.
794619_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	For additional discussion of risks that could affect the Company and its business, see Forward-Looking Statements above and Risk Factors in the Company s most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
794619_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	As of April 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the Company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported.
794619_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
794619_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
794619_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
794619_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	For purposes of assessing if impairment exists, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
794619_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	To determine whether an impairment has occurred, the Company compares estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying values.
794619_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	The Company has not recognized impairments of long-lived assets in the last three years other than the impairments related to restructuring activities.
794619_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
794619_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability.
794619_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit total exposure.
794619_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company establishes a liability at the balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of the Company s employees.
794619_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company s Board of Directors approved the freezing of both defined benefit pension plans, effective as of April 30, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	As a result, the Company re-measured its pension liability, updating the pension measurement assumptions, and recorded pension curtailment charges of $0.3 million during fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The estimated expense, benefits and pension obligation of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations and the future rate of compensation level increases.
794619_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	In fiscal 2012, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Aon Hewitt AA Bond Universe Yield Curve.
794619_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	Previously, the Company referred to the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve in establishing the discount rate.
794619_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	This change was caused by the merger of Aon and Hewitt and the corresponding elimination of the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve.
794619_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical 1% change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and consumer price index:
794619_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2012 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note H of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	At April 30, 2012, the discount rate was 4.66% compared to 5.66% at April 30, 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	The expected return on plan assets was 7.5% at April 30, 2012, compared to 8.0% at April 30, 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	The assumed rate of increase in compensation levels was 4.0% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012, unchanged from the prior fiscal year.
794619_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	The projected performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have been as a result of the changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to market at each annual measurement date.
794619_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	From the fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 5.91% to 5.66%, and caused an actuarial loss of $4.5 million that was recognized in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	From the fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 5.66% at April 30, 2011 to 4.76% at December 31, 2011 and 4.66% at April 30, 2012, which caused an additional actuarial loss of $26.3 million.
794619_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants.
794619_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees, were 3.1%, 11.9% and 21.5% for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2012 was $85.7 million compared to $83.3 million at April 30, 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	The Company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by $50.5 million in fiscal 2012 and $36.7 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	The $13.8 million increase in the Company s net under-funded position during fiscal 2012 was driven by the Company s $26.3 million actuarial losses, plus additional service benefits accruing of $5.3 million, offset in part by curtailments related to freezing the pension plans as of April 30, 2012, which stopped all future benefit accruals.
794619_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Company expects its pension expense to decrease from $7.4 million in fiscal 2012 to $0.6 million in fiscal 2013, due to the elimination of future benefit accruals related to the freezing of the pension plans.
794619_12_ITEM7_P84_S4	The Company expects to contribute $7.4 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2013, which represents required funding.
794619_12_ITEM7_P84_S5	The Company made contributions of $2.9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P84_S6	Under the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Company was not required to make contributions to its pension plans in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Company invests in promotional displays in retail stores to demonstrate product features, product specifications, quality specifications and serve as a training tool for designers.
794619_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	The investment is carried at cost less applicable amortization.
794619_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Amortization is provided by the straight-line method on an individual display basis over the estimated period of economic benefit, approximately 30 to 36 months.
794619_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The Company believes that the estimated period of economic benefit provides an accurate reflection of the value of displays as of the date of the balance sheet based on historical experience.
794619_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.
794619_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	The warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the Company s remaining obligation based on anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.
794619_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates.
794619_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Warranty claims are generally made within three months of the original shipment date.
794619_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	The calculation of stock-based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment.
794619_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	These estimates include the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit award granted.
794619_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Stock option awards are estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
794619_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	There are two significant inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model: expected volatility and expected term.
794619_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	The Company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_12_ITEM7_P90_S3	The expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the Company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding.
794619_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	For performance-based restricted stock units, the Company estimates the number of shares that will be granted upon satisfaction of the performance conditions, based upon actual and expected future operating results.
794619_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant management judgment.
794619_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	As a result, if factors change or the Company uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
794619_12_ITEM7_P91_S3	In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
794619_12_ITEM7_P91_S4	If the Company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.
794619_12_ITEM7_P91_S5	See Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on stock-based compensation.
794619_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Based upon the Company s analysis at April 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company determined in each case that a valuation allowance was not required.
794619_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	The Company considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining the need for a valuation allowance.
794619_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	As a result of the Company s recent restructuring activities plus prospects for sales growth, management expects the Company to return to profitability in fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Based upon this analysis, management determined that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized through expected future income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.
794619_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	The Company will continue to update this analysis on a periodic basis and changes in expectations about future income or the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences could cause the Company to record a valuation allowance in a future period.
794619_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements.
794619_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	Additionally, ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present comprehensive income and its components as part of the statement of shareholders equity.
794619_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	The ASU does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income.
794619_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	ASU 2011-05 became effective for the Company beginning May 1, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date of Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05.
794619_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	The amendments were made to allow FASB time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income.
794619_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Companies are required to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU 2011-05.
794619_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	All other requirements in ASU 2011-05 are not affected by ASU 2011-12.
794619_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The costs of the Company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations.
794619_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company has generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases.
794619_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	On April 30, 2012, the Company had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements.
794619_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company does not currently use commodity or interest rate derivatives or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price or interest rate risks.
794619_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Company manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company's products are sold across the United States through a network of independent dealers and distributors and directly to home centers and major builders.

794619_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $37.4 million, $30.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash in excess of operating requirements is invested in money market accounts which are carried at cost (which approximates fair value).
794619_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
794619_12_ITEM8_P7_S2	Cash equivalents were $31.8 million and $46.8 million at April 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	Inventories : Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market.
794619_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	Inventory costs are determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
794619_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	The LIFO cost reserve is determined in the aggregate for inventory and is applied as a reduction to inventories determined on the first-in, first-out method (FIFO).
794619_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	FIFO inventory cost approximates replacement cost.
794619_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated on the basis of cost less accumulated depreciation.
794619_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 15 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.
794619_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	Assets under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.
794619_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
794619_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company concluded no impairment existed, except for impairments related to restructuring activities.

794619_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	The Company's investment in promotional displays is carried at cost less applicable amortization.
794619_12_ITEM8_P13_S3	Amortization is provided by the straight-line method on an individual display basis over periods of 30 to 36 months (the estimated period of benefit).
794619_12_ITEM8_P13_S4	Promotional display amortization expense for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $5.6 million, $7.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively, and is included in selling and marketing expenses.
794619_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Income Taxes: The Company accounts for deferred income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which these items are expected to reverse.
794619_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	At each reporting date, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
794619_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	Pensions : The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of the Company s employees.
794619_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	Both defined benefit pension plans were frozen effective April 30, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, in its consolidated balance sheets.
794619_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company also recognizes the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs, credits and transition costs as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
794619_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Stock-Based Compensation: The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period.
794619_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements : In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements.
794619_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Additionally, ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present comprehensive income and its components as part of the statement of shareholders equity.
794619_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	The ASU does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income.

794619_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Potentially dilutive shares of 139,000, 90,000 and 20,000 issuable under the Company s securities have been excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
794619_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company has two types of stock-based compensation awards in effect for its employees and directors.
794619_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Company has issued stock options since 1986 and issued initial grants of restricted stock units (RSUs) during fiscal 2010.

794619_12_ITEM8_P40_S3	The Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
794619_12_ITEM8_P40_S4	The Company estimates the forfeiture rates based upon its historical experience.
794619_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	At April 30, 2012, the Company had stock option and RSU awards outstanding under four different plans: (1) 1999 stock option plan for employees; (2) amended and restated 2004 stock incentive plan for employees; (3) 2006 non-employee directors equity ownership plan; and (4) 2011 non-employee directors equity ownership plan.

794619_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	For purposes of valuing stock option grants, the Company has identified two employee groups and one non-employee director group, based upon observed option exercise patterns.
794619_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the Company s stock options for each of the three groups.
794619_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	Using this option-pricing model, the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant.
794619_12_ITEM8_P42_S3	The fair value of the Company s stock option awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock options.
794619_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	The expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from the Company s historical exercise experience and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding for each of the three identified groups.
794619_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	The expected term assumption incorporates the contractual term of an option grant, which is generally ten years for employees and from four to ten years for non-employee directors, as well as the vesting period of an award, which is typically three years.
794619_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	For purposes of determining the fair value of RSUs, the Company uses the closing stock price of its common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant, reduced by the discounted value of future expected dividend payments during the vesting period, since the recipients are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
794619_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	The fair value of the Company s RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the RSUs to the extent the Company believes it is probable the related performance criteria, if any, will be met.
794619_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the vesting period of the RSU grant.
794619_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	The weighted-average assumptions and valuation of the Company s stock options were as follows:
794619_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Stock options granted and outstanding under each of the Company s plans vest evenly over a three-year period and have contractual terms ranging from four to ten years.
794619_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	The exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the option grant date.
794619_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The following table presents a summary of the Company s stock option activity for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (remaining contractual term in years and exercise prices are weighted-averages):
794619_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the previous table of the outstanding options on April 30, 2012 represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the excess, if any, of the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2012 over the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) of the shares of the Company s common stock that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on April 30, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	This amount changes based upon the fair market value of the Company s common stock.
794619_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	The total fair value of options vested for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $2.4 million, $3.3 million and $4.8 million, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	As of April 30, 2012, there was $0.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under the Company s stock-based compensation plans.
794619_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.
794619_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Cash received from option exercises for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was an aggregate of $0.0 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises of stock option awards totaled $3,000, $84,000 and $215,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at April 30, 2012 (remaining lives in years and exercise prices are weighted-averages):
794619_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company s RSUs granted to employees cliff-vest over a three-year period from date of grant, while RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest daily over a two-year period from date of grant.
794619_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Directors were granted service-based RSUs only, while employees were awarded both service-based and performance-based RSUs (PBRSUs) in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010.
794619_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	The PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2012 are earned based on achievement of a number of goals pertaining to the Company s operational and financial performance during the performance period of fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	Employees who satisfy the vesting criteria will receive a proportional amount of PBRSUs based upon the Compensation Committee s assessment of the Company s achievement of the performance criteria.
794619_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	The following table contains a summary of the Company s RSU activity for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
794619_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	As of April 30, 2012, there was $2.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs granted under the Company s stock-based compensation plans.
794619_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.
794619_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 stock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows:
794619_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	In fiscal 1990, the Company instituted the American Woodmark Investment Savings Stock Ownership Plan.
794619_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	Under this plan, all employees who are at least 18 years old and have been employed by the Company for at least six consecutive months are eligible to receive Company stock through a discretionary profit-sharing contribution and a 401(k) matching contribution based upon the employee's contribution to the plan.
794619_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company did not make, or recognize any expenses for, discretionary profit-sharing contributions in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010.
794619_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	During fiscal 2012, the Company matched 401(k) contributions in the form of Company stock at 50% of an employee's annual contribution to the plan up to 4% of base earnings for an effective maximum Company contribution of 2% of base earnings.
794619_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	As part of the realignment of its retirement plans, the Company will match 401(k) contributions in the form of Company stock at 100% of an employee s annual contribution to the plan up to 4% of base earnings beginning in fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	The expense for 401(k) matching contributions for this plan was $1,284,000, $1,272,000, and $1,284,000, in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering virtually all of the Company s employees.
794619_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	These plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average earnings (for salaried employees) or benefit rate (for hourly employees).
794619_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	In December 2011, the Company s Board of Directors approved the freezing of both of the Company s defined benefit pension plans, effective April 30, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	As a result, the Company re-measured its pension liability, updating the pension measurement assumptions, and recorded pension curtailment charges of $0.3 million.
794619_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at April 30, 2012 is $45.3 million ($27.6 million net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension benefit costs.
794619_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company expects to recognize $0.9 million ($0.6 million net of tax) in net actuarial losses in net periodic pension benefit costs during fiscal 2013.The Company uses an April 30 measurement date for its benefit plans.
794619_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company s non-contributory defined benefit pension plans as of April 30:
794619_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was $136,264,000 and $106,600,000 at April 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
794619_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Actuarial Assumptions : The discount rate at April 30 was used to measure the year-end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year.
794619_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and earnings effects for the pension plans follow:
794619_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	* The rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond April 30, 2012 because the Company froze its pension plans.
794619_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	In fiscal 2012, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Aon Hewitt AA Bond Universe Yield Curve.
794619_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	In fiscal 2011, the Company referred to the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve in establishing the discount rate.
794619_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	This change was caused by the merger of Aon and Hewitt and the corresponding elimination of the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve.
794619_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions.
794619_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Company also considered the related historical ten-year average asset returns at April 30, 2012.
794619_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company amortizes experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, over a period no longer than the average future working lifetime of the active participants.
794619_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Contributions: The Company funds the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts the Company deems appropriate.
794619_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company expects to contribute $7.4 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2013.
794619_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	The Company made contributions of $2.9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2012.
794619_12_ITEM8_P73_S2	The Company was not required to make, and did not make, any contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2011.
794619_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	Estimated Future Benefit Payments : The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid:
794619_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	Plan Assets: Pension assets by major category of plan assets and the type of fair value measurement as of April 30, 2012 and 2011 are presented in the following tables:

794619_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by the Pension Committee.
794619_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and occasionally the Pension Committee will approve allocations above or below a target range.
794619_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	During a period of uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets, the Pension Committee may suspend the Target Asset Allocation and manage the investment mix as it sees reasonable, prudent and in the best interest of the plans to better protect the value of the plan assets.
794619_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company s pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at April 30, 2012 and 2011, by asset category, were as follows:

794619_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
794619_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation ( American Woodmark or the Company ) manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	American Woodmark was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division.
794619_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	American Woodmark was operated privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a registered public offering of its common stock.
794619_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in approximately 550 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles.
794619_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Styles vary by design and color from natural wood finishes to low-pressure laminate surfaces.
794619_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	The product offering of stock cabinets includes 86 door designs in 18 colors.
794619_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stock cabinets consist of cabinet interiors of varying dimensions and construction options and a maple, oak, cherry, or hickory front frame, door and/or drawer front.
794619_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark , Timberlake , Shenandoah Cabinetry , Potomac , and Waypoint Living Spaces .
794619_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	American Woodmark s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company services these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of nine service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.
794619_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company distributes its products to each market channel directly from four assembly plants through a third party logistics network.
794619_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	The primary raw materials used include hard maple, oak, cherry, soft maple, and hickory lumber and plywood.
794619_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, manufactured components, and hardware.
794619_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company currently purchases paint from one supplier; however, other sources are available.
794619_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	Other raw materials are purchased from more than one source and are readily available.
794619_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers.
794619_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality.
794619_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.
794619_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	General economic forces and changes in the Company s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material.
794619_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage.
794619_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio of well below 20%, and working capital exclusive of cash of less than 6% of net sales.
794619_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	At April 30, 2013, debt to capital was 13.9%, and working capital net of cash was 1.9% of net sales.
794619_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	During the last fiscal year, American Woodmark had two primary customers, The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc., which together accounted for approximately 59% of the Company s sales in its fiscal year ended April 30, 2013 (fiscal 2013).
794619_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
794619_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	As of May 31, 2013, the Company had 4,537 employees.
794619_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	None of the Company s employees are represented by labor unions.
794619_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Company believes that its employee relations are good.
794619_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	charge on the Company s web site at www.americanwoodmark.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
794619_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	The contents of the Company s web site are not, however, part of this report.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or currently believed to be immaterial also may adversely impact the business.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings Forward-Looking Statements, Market Risks, and Outlook for Fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company s business is dependent upon remodeling activity and residential construction.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The Company s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Prolonged economic downturns may adversely impact the Company s sales, earnings and liquidity.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although they have recently rebounded, the Company s fiscal 2013 sales levels were 25% below their peak levels of 2006.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company s industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During economic downturns, the Company s industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The Company believes that its industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors not only may affect the ultimate consumer of the Company s products, but also may impact home centers, builders and the Company s other primary customers.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, a worsening of current conditions could adversely affect the Company s sales and earnings as well as its cash flow and liquidity.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company s future financial performance depends in part on the success of its new product development and other growth strategies.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus solely on organic growth.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, the Company s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The loss of, or a reduction in business from, either of the Company s key customers would have a material adverse effect upon its business.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The size and importance to the Company of its two largest customers is significant.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc. were approximately 59% of total company sales for fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although builders, dealers, and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Manufacturing realignments and cost savings programs similar to the Company s 2012 Restructuring Plan could result in a decrease in the Company s near-term earnings and liquidity.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company continually reviews its manufacturing operations.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These reviews could result in manufacturing realignments and cost savings programs, such as the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems, or procedures, which in turn could result in a charge that would decrease near-term earnings and liquidity until the expected cost reductions are achieved.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any such realignments would likely result in significant costs including, among others, severance, impairment, exit, and disposal costs and capital expenditures.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Impairment charges could reduce the Company s profitability.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company has significant long-lived assets, including deferred tax assets, recorded on its balance sheets.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If operating results decline or if the Company decides to restructure results as it did with the 2012 Restructuring Plan, the Company could incur impairment charges, which could have a material impact on its financial results.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets on an ongoing basis.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The outcome of future reviews could result in substantial impairment charges.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment assessments inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about market conditions and the Company s ability to generate future cash flows and profitability, given those assumptions.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Future events and changing market conditions may impact the Company s assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may result in changes in the Company s estimates.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although the Company believes the assumptions used in testing for impairment are reasonable, significant changes in these assumptions could produce a significantly different result.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company s operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Because the Company is dependent on outside suppliers for raw material needs, it must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from its suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to inflation and increasing costs.
794619_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.
794619_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	American Woodmark leases its Corporate Office located in Winchester, Virginia.
794619_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition, the Company leases 1 manufacturing facility in Hardy County, West Virginia and owns 8 manufacturing facilities located primarily in the eastern United States.
794619_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also leases 9 primary service centers, 2 satellite service centers, and 3 additional office centers located throughout the United States that support the sale and distribution of products to each market channel.

794619_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition, American Woodmark owns two manufacturing facilities that are permanently closed.
794619_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company accounts for these loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450.
794619_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible or remote, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	Where no loss estimate range can be made, the Company and its counsel perform a worst-case estimate.
794619_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of estimated loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of April 30, 2013.

794619_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation common stock is quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the AMWD symbol.
794619_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	Common stock per share market prices and cash dividends declared during the last two fiscal years were as follows:

794619_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company paid dividends on its common stock during the first quarter of 2012 and then its quarterly dividend was suspended.
794619_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	The determination as to the payment and the amount of any future dividends will be made by the Board of Directors from time to time and will depend on the Company s then-current financial condition, capital requirements, results of operations and any other factors then deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.
794619_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	On August 24, 2007, the Company announced that the Company s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company s common stock.
794619_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	This authorization has no expiration date.
794619_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company did not repurchase any shares under this authorization.
794619_13_ITEM5_P2_S3	At April 30, 2013, $93.3 million remained authorized by the Company s Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock.

794619_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	In addition, the Company participates in an industry that is subject to rapidly changing conditions and there are numerous factors that could cause the Company to experience a decline in sales and/or earnings or deterioration in financial condition.
794619_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	These include but are not limited to: (1) general economic or business conditions and instability in the financial and credit markets, including their potential impact on our (i) sales and operating costs and access to financing; and (ii) customers and suppliers and their ability to obtain financing or generate the cash necessary to conduct their respective businesses; (2) the cyclical nature of the Company s industry, which is particularly sensitive to changes in consumer confidence, the amount of consumers income available for discretionary purchases, and the availability and terms of consumer credit; (3) economic weakness in a specific channel of distribution; (4) the loss of sales from specific customers due to their loss of market share, bankruptcy or switching to a competitor; (5) risks associated with domestic manufacturing operations, including fluctuations in capacity utilization and the prices and availability of key raw materials as well as fuel, transportation, warehousing and labor costs and environmental compliance and remediation costs; (6) the need to respond to price or product initiatives launched by a competitor; (7) the Company s ability to successfully implement initiatives related to increasing market share, new products, maintaining and increasing its sales force and new product displays; and (8) sales growth at a rate that outpaces the Company s ability to install new capacity or a sales decline that requires reduction or realignment of the Company s manufacturing capacity.
794619_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2013, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
794619_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	While the Company believes that these risks are manageable and will not adversely impact the long-term performance of the Company, these risks could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition.
794619_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Any forward-looking statement that the Company makes speaks only as of the date of this annual report.
794619_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
794619_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	American Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors.
794619_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	At April 30, 2013, the Company operated 9 manufacturing facilities and 9 service centers across the country.
794619_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	During the Company s fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2013 (fiscal 2013), the Company experienced improving housing market conditions for the first time since the housing market downturn that began in 2007.
794619_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	A number of positive factors evidenced the improving housing market, including:
794619_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Cabinet sales, as reported by members of the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA), increased by 11% during fiscal 2013, suggesting an increase in both new construction and remodeling sales of cabinets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Faced with an improving but still relatively subdued remodeling market, the Company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize an elevated level of sales promotions in the Company s product category during fiscal 2013 to boost sales, although a noticeable easing occurred in the second half of fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company strives to maintain its promotional levels in line with market activity, with a goal of remaining competitive.
794619_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Company experienced promotional levels during fiscal 2013 that were lower than those experienced in its prior fiscal year.
794619_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	The Company s remodeling sales increased at a high-single digit pace during fiscal 2013 in a remodeling market that appears to have improved by a bit less than that level.
794619_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company increased its net sales by 22% during fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Company realized strong sales gains in its new construction channel during fiscal 2013, where sales increased by more than 40%, significantly outpacing the improvement in single-family housing starts.
794619_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	result, combined with the Company s increased remodeling sales, indicates the Company realized market share gains in both of its sales channels during fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company announced several initiatives designed to reduce its cost base (the 2012 Restructuring), including the permanent closure of two manufacturing plants, the decision to sell a previously closed manufacturing facility, and the realignment of its retirement program, including the freezing of its pension plans.
794619_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	All of these initiatives were completed either prior to or just after the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2013, and restructuring charges related to these actions have been reflected in the Company s results during both years.
794619_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2013 was 16.3%, significantly improved from 12.9% in fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in the Company s gross margin rate was driven by reductions in the labor and overhead costs associated with the Company s restructuring activities, the beneficial impact of increased sales volume and the absence of the prior year s inventory write down, which more than offset the impact of rising materials costs.
794619_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company recorded restructuring charges of $15.9 million (pre-tax) and $10.0 million (after-tax) during fiscal 2012 and $1.4 million (pre-tax) and $0.9 million (after-tax) during fiscal 2013 in connection with these initiatives.
794619_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Because the bulk of these restructuring efforts have been completed, the Company expects that its future out-of-pocket costs will be nominal.
794619_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Company sold a previously closed plant during fiscal 2013 and continues to include in Other Assets at an aggregate $2.7 million book value the other two plants held for sale that were included in the 2012 Restructuring.
794619_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company had a history of profitable operations for 16 consecutive years, from 1994 to 2009, followed by losses that coincided with the industry downturn from 2010 to 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	As of April 30, 2013, the Company had total deferred tax assets of $38.7 million, down from $42.1 million at April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Growth in the Company s deferred tax assets in recent fiscal years resulted primarily from growth in its defined benefit pension liabilities and the impact of its recent losses prior to fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	The Company earned sufficient net income during fiscal 2013 to fully utilize its Federal net operating loss carryforward.
794619_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	To fully realize these net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to, among other things, substantially reduce its net unfunded pension obligation of $53.7 million at April 30, 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	The Company took definitive actions when it froze its pension plans as part of the 2012 Restructuring to enhance the probability that this objective is achieved in the future.
794619_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company resumed the funding of its pension plans during fiscal year 2012, and expects to continue funding these plans for the foreseeable future, which will reduce both its unfunded pension plan obligation and its deferred tax asset.
794619_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	These actions, coupled with the recent improvement in the U.S. housing market and the Company s continued ability to grow its sales at a faster rate than its competitors, have enabled the Company to generate net income and reduce its deferred tax assets and unfunded pension obligation during fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Company believes that the positive evidence of the housing industry improvement, coupled with the benefits from the Company s successful restructuring and continued market share gains have already driven a return to profitability that is expected to continue, and that the combined impact of these positive factors outweighs the negative factor of the Company s previous losses.
794619_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Accordingly, Management has concluded it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company also regularly assesses its long-lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred.
794619_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company has concluded that none of the long-lived assets pertaining to its 9 manufacturing plants or any of its other long-lived assets were impaired as of April 30, 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Net sales were $630.4 million in fiscal 2013, an increase of $114.6 million, or 22%, compared with fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2013 was 17% higher than in fiscal 2012, which management believes was driven primarily by the Company s increased market share.
794619_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 4% in fiscal 2013, driven by improvements in the Company s product mix.
794619_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased 14% to $515.8 million from $452.6 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2012 was 9% higher than in fiscal 2011, which management believes was driven primarily by the Company s increased market share.
794619_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 5% during fiscal 2012, driven primarily by improvements in product mix.
794619_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 16.3% in fiscal 2013 as compared with 12.9% in fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of higher sales volume and labor and overhead cost savings associated with the Company s two plant closures in April and May of 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	This favorability was partially offset by an increase in material costs.
794619_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Sales promotion costs improved by 1.4% of net sales during fiscal 2013 compared with the prior year, as a result of both an increased proportion of new construction sales to the Company s total sales and reduced promotional activity.
794619_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Sales promotions that involved the use of free products or cash reimbursements back to the Company s large remodeling customers were deducted from gross margin as opposed to being classified as operating expenses.
794619_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	During fiscal 2012, the Company s gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to 12.9% from 11.7% in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Increased sales volume in fiscal 2012 created improved labor efficiencies and more favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs, which were partially offset by increased sales promotion costs, material costs and diesel fuel.
794619_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Sales promotion costs increased by 0.7% of net sales during fiscal 2012, as the Company chose to remain competitive with competitors promotional offerings to drive sales growth in a challenging market.
794619_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2013 were 9.1% of net sales, compared with 11.3% of net sales in fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Selling and marketing costs decreased by 1% despite a 22% increase in net sales.
794619_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	The improvement in sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to reduced spending on product launch costs and cost reductions related to the Company s retirement plan changes, which were offset in part by increased sales compensation and staffing costs related to the Company s increased sales levels.
794619_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were 11.3% of net sales in fiscal 2012 compared with 13.5% in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Cost savings from lower marketing collateral and branding costs, as well as reductions in product display costs more than offset the increases in employee compensation and travel costs incurred by the Company in fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	General and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million or 9% during fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in cost was entirely related to increased pay-for-performance compensation.
794619_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	However, G A costs declined to 4.4% of net sales in fiscal 2013 compared with 4.9% of net sales in fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 increased by $2.6 million, or 12%, compared with fiscal 2011 and represented 4.9% of net sales, compared with 5.0% of net sales for fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	The majority of the cost increase was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation.
794619_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company generated pre-tax income of $16.7 million during fiscal 2013, including $1.4 million of restructuring charges.
794619_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Company s effective tax rate increased from 37.6% in fiscal 2012 to 41.7% in fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The higher effective tax rate was the result of relatively consistent amounts of permanent tax differences in relation to the net income generated in fiscal 2013 compared with the net loss generated in the prior year.
794619_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company tracks several metrics, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence, which it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company believes that housing prices finally bottomed during its fiscal 2012 and have begun what it expects will be a multi-year improvement, driven by employment growth and a resumption of growth in new household formation.
794619_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	However, because the number of homeowners still owing more than what their homes are worth remains at historically high levels, the Company expects that while the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement it will continue to be well below the historic highs reached in the previous decade.
794619_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Driven by an improving housing market, the Company expects that industry-wide cabinet remodeling sales will continue a trend that began during fiscal 2013 and improve at roughly a mid-single digit rate during its fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	be relatively stable in fiscal 2014 and it will continue to gain market share in its growing dealer business.
794619_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	This combination is expected to result in remodeling sales growth that outpaces the market by several percentage points.
794619_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company agrees with the consensus estimate that new construction starts will continue to grow at a mid-20% rate during its fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company s new construction sales growth outperformed the new construction market by approximately 20 points during fiscal 2013, and expects that it will again outperform the new construction market during fiscal 2014 but by a significantly lesser rate, as its comparable prior year sales levels become more challenging.
794619_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements, the Company expects that it will grow its total sales at a mid-teen rate in fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company experienced production inefficiencies during the first half of its fiscal 2013 driven by the combination of work transition issues from its closed plants, coupled with production volume increases that were driven by unexpectedly high sales levels.
794619_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	These issues were resolved during the third quarter of the Company s fiscal 2013, enabling the Company s gross margin rate to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	The Company expects that its gross margin rate and net income for fiscal 2014 will improve compared with its fiscal 2013 performance.
794619_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company had gross outlays for capital expenditures and customer display units of $13.5 million during fiscal 2013, and plans to increase this spending level modestly during fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	However, the Company is undertaking a multi-year review of its manufacturing capacity and capital expenditure plans which could cause its capital expenditures to exceed this level.
794619_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this annual report, including under Forward-Looking Statements, and elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis, as well as in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2013 filed with the SEC, including under Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
794619_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $97.0 million at April 30, 2013, which represented an increase of $23.3 million from April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Total debt was $24.7 million at April 30, 2013, virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year and long-term debt, excluding current maturities, to capital was 13.9% at April 30, 2013, down from 15.5% at April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities.
794619_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	During fiscal 2013 the Company renegotiated its revolving credit agreement with its primary lender and is no longer required to hold restricted cash to secure borrowings under that agreement.
794619_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was $24.5 million, compared with $16.1 million in fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The $8.4 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $22.9 million improvement in net income and reduction in asset impairments related to the 2012 Restructuring.
794619_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	This improvement was offset in part by a $13.6 million net working capital investment in its operating assets and liabilities to fund growth and increased contributions to its pension plans of $2.0 million.
794619_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was $16.1 million, compared with $13.2 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The $2.9 million improvement was primarily attributable to the reduction in the Company s operating loss exclusive of restructuring charges of $13.9 million.
794619_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	This improvement was offset in part by reductions in proceeds from income tax refunds of $7.1 million, from increasing funding to its pension plans of $2.9 million, and from funding restructuring costs of $1.2 million.
794619_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company s investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays.
794619_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Net cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2013 was $6.1 million, compared with $9.9 million in fiscal 2012 and $5.5 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Investments in property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2013 were $8.9 million, compared with $6.7 million in fiscal 2012 and $5.0 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	Investments in promotional displays were $4.8 million in fiscal 2013, compared with $3.3 million in fiscal 2012 and $3.5 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	The increased level of investment during fiscal 2013 primarily represents machinery and equipment enhancements to enable production volume to increase and an increase in the number of display units deployed with customers.
794619_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	During fiscal 2013, the Company s reduced net cash used for investing activities was driven by the receipt of $6.4 million in proceeds from the sales of assets from closed plants and insurance proceeds of $1.0 million, which more than offset the aggregate $3.6 million increase in outflows for capital expenditures and promotional displays.
794619_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Company generated positive free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities) of $18.4 million during fiscal 2013, compared with $6.1 million in fiscal 2012 and $7.7 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in fiscal 2013 was driven by the net improvements in both cash provided by operating activities and decreased net outflows used for investing activities.
794619_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	The reduction in fiscal 2012 was driven by increased net outflows used for investing activities that more than offset net improvements in cash provided by operating activities.
794619_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company realized a net inflow of $11.9 million from financing activities in fiscal 2013, compared with a $5.1 million inflow in fiscal 2012, and a net outflow of $5.5 million in fiscal 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Reductions in the amount of restricted cash drove inflows of approximately $7 million in both fiscal 2013 and 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	Additional proceeds of $5.9 million were generated during fiscal 2013 from the exercise of stock options.
794619_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	Approximately $1 million was used to repay long-term debt in each of the years in the three-year period ended in fiscal 2013, while fiscal 2012 and 2011 was further impacted by dividend payments to shareholders of $1.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
794619_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company elected to suspend its quarterly dividend during fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Company ended fiscal 2013 with a record level of nearly $97 million in cash and cash equivalents.
794619_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company is authorized to repurchase up to $93.3 million of its stock under an authorization approved by its Board of Directors in 2007.
794619_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Company continues to evaluate its cash on hand and prospects for future cash generation, and compare these against its go-forward reinvestment plans for future capital expenditures.
794619_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Although the evaluation of its future capital expenditures is ongoing, the Company expects that it will make repurchases of its common stock from time to time during fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company can borrow up to $35 million under the Wells Fargo credit facility, subject to a maximum borrowing base equal to 75% of eligible accounts receivable, 50% of eligible pre bill reserves and up to $20 million for equipment value (each as defined in the agreement).
794619_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	At April 30, 2013, $10 million of loans and $3.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Wells Fargo facility.
794619_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	An amendment to the revolving credit facility and modifications to related security arrangements completed on March 18, 2013 eliminated the requirement that 50% of the Company s outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo be secured by cash and securities held in certain of the Company s accounts with Wells Fargo.
794619_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The Company s outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Company can borrow under the revolving credit facility up to the lesser of $35 million or the maximum borrowing base (which equals 75% of eligible accounts receivable, 50% of eligible pre bill reserves and up to $20 million for equipment value, each as defined in the agreement) less any outstanding loan balance.
794619_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Any outstanding loan balance bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (0.25% at April 30, 2013) plus 2.625%.
794619_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	worth of not greater than 1.4 to 1.0; (2) maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than 1.25 to 1.0 measured on a rolling four-quarter basis; (3) maintain at least $1.00 in net income for the fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2013 and at least $1.00 in net income on a rolling four-quarter basis for the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2013; and comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants.
794619_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the amended credit facility as of April 30, 2013, as follows: (1) the Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at April 30, 2013 was 1.0 to 1.0; (2) cash flow to fixed charges for its most recent four quarters was 2.72 to 1.0; and (3) its net income for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2013 was $5.2 million.
794619_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	The revolving credit facility does not limit the Company s ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the Company is in compliance with these covenants.
794619_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The timing of the Company s contractual obligations as of April 30, 2013 is summarized in the table below:
794619_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	1 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the Company s primary loan agreement, term loans and capitalized lease agreements.
794619_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Amounts outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility, $10 million at April 30, 2013, bear a variable interest rate determined by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.625%.
794619_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Interest under the Company s term loans and capitalized lease agreements is fixed at rates between 2% and 6.5%.
794619_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt for the Company s revolving credit facility are at LIBOR plus the spread as of April 30, 2013, throughout the remaining term of the facility.
794619_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	2 The estimated cost of the Company s two defined benefit pension plans is determined annually based upon the discount rate and other assumptions at fiscal year end.
794619_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Future pension funding contributions beyond fiscal 2019 have not been determined at this time.
794619_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The costs of the Company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations.
794619_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company has generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases.
794619_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	On April 30, 2013, the Company had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements.
794619_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company does not currently use commodity or interest rate derivatives or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price or interest rate risks.
794619_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	For additional discussion of risks that could affect the Company and its business, see Forward-Looking Statements above and Risk Factors in the Company s most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
794619_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	As of April 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
794619_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the Company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported.
794619_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.
794619_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
794619_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
794619_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	For purposes of assessing if impairment exists, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	To determine whether an impairment has occurred, the Company compares estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying values.
794619_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	The Company has not recognized impairments of long-lived assets in the last three years other than the impairments related to restructuring activities.
794619_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
794619_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability.
794619_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit total exposure.
794619_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company establishes a liability at each balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salary defined benefit pension plans.
794619_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The estimated expense, benefits and pension obligations of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations.
794619_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	In fiscal 2013 and 2012, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Aon Hewitt AA Bond Universe Yield Curve.
794619_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	In fiscal 2011, the Company referred to the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve in establishing the discount rate.
794619_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	This change was caused by the merger of Aon and Hewitt and the corresponding elimination of the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve.
794619_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical 1% change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and consumer price index:
794619_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2013 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note H of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	At April 30, 2013, the discount rate was 4.21% compared with 4.66% at April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The expected return on plan assets was 7.5% at both April 30, 2013, and April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	The assumed rate of increase in compensation levels was 4.0% for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2012 and 2011.
794619_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	The rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond April 30, 2012 because the Company froze its pension plans as of that date.
794619_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The projected performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have resulted from changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to market at each annual measurement date.
794619_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	From the fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 5.66% at April 30, 2011 to 4.66% at April 30, 2012, which caused an actuarial loss of $26.3 million.
794619_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	From the fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 4.66% to 4.21% which caused an actuarial loss of $10.8 million.
794619_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants.
794619_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees, were 10.2%, 3.1% and 11.9% for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
794619_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2013 was $95.7 million compared with $85.7 million at April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	The Company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by $53.7 million in fiscal 2013 and by $50.5 million in fiscal 2012.
794619_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	The $3.2 million increase in the Company s net under-funded position during fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by the Company s $10.8 million actuarial losses, offset in part by a higher return on plan assets and Company contributions.
794619_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	The Company expects its pension expense to decrease from $0.6 million in fiscal 2013 to $0.2 million in fiscal 2014, due primarily to a higher expected return on plan assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	The Company expects to contribute $2.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2014, which represents required funding.
794619_13_ITEM7_P85_S5	The Company made contributions of $4.9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2013.
794619_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The Company invests in promotional displays in retail stores to demonstrate product features, product and quality specifications and serve as a training tool for designers.
794619_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The investment is carried at cost less applicable amortization.
794619_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Amortization is provided by the straight-line method on an individual display basis over the estimated period of economic benefit, approximately 30 to 36 months.
794619_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	The Company believes that the estimated period of economic benefit provides an accurate reflection of the value of displays as of the date of the balance sheet based on historical experience.
794619_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.
794619_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	The warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the Company s remaining obligation based on anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.
794619_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates.
794619_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Warranty claims are generally made within two months of the original shipment date.
794619_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	The calculation of stock-based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment.
794619_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	These estimates include the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit award granted.
794619_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Stock option awards are estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
794619_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	There are two significant inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model: expected volatility and expected term.
794619_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	The Company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	The expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the Company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding.
794619_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	For performance-based restricted stock units, the Company estimates the number of shares that will be granted upon satisfaction of the performance conditions, based upon actual and expected future operating results.
794619_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant management judgment.
794619_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	As a result, if factors change or the Company uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
794619_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
794619_13_ITEM7_P92_S4	If the Company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.
794619_13_ITEM7_P92_S5	See Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on stock-based compensation.
794619_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	Based upon the Company s analysis at April 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company determined in each case that a valuation allowance was not required.
794619_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	The Company considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining the need for a valuation allowance.
794619_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	Based upon this analysis, management determined that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized through expected future income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.
794619_13_ITEM7_P93_S4	The Company will continue to update this analysis on a periodic basis and changes in expectations about future income or the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences could cause the Company to record a valuation allowance in a future period.
794619_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.

794619_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the Company s stock options for each of the three groups.
794619_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	Using this option-pricing model, the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant.
794619_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	The fair value of the Company s stock option awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock options.

794619_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from the Company s historical exercise experience and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding for each of the three identified groups.
794619_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	The expected term assumption incorporates the contractual term of an option grant, which is generally ten years for employees and from four to ten years for non-employee directors, as well as the vesting period of an award, which is typically three years.
794619_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option granted.

794619_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	The fair value of the Company s RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the RSUs to the extent the Company believes it is probable the related performance criteria, if any, will be met.
794619_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the vesting period of the RSU grant.
794619_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	The weighted-average assumptions and valuation of the Company s stock options were as follows:
794619_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Stock options granted and outstanding under each of the Company s plans vest evenly over a three-year period and have contractual terms of ten years.
794619_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	The exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the option grant date.
794619_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	The following table presents a summary of the Company s stock option activity for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (remaining contractual term in years and exercise prices are weighted-averages):
794619_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the previous table of the outstanding options on April 30, 2013 represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the excess, if any, of the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2013 over the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) of the shares of the Company s common stock that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on April 30, 2013.
794619_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	This amount changes based upon the fair market value of the Company s common stock.

794619_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.
794619_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 stock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows:
794619_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	In fiscal 1990, the Company instituted the American Woodmark Investment Savings Stock Ownership Plan.
794619_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Under this plan, all employees who are at least 18 years old and have been employed by the Company for at least six consecutive months are eligible to receive Company stock through a discretionary profit-sharing contribution and a 401(k) matching contribution based upon the employee's contribution to the plan.
794619_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2013, discretionary profit-sharing contributions in the form of Company stock may be made annually.
794619_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	Prior to fiscal 2013, profit-sharing contributions in the form of Company stock were 3% of after-tax earnings, calculated on a quarterly basis.
794619_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company did not make, or recognize any expenses for, discretionary profit-sharing contributions in fiscal years 2012 and 2011.
794619_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Prior to fiscal 2013, the Company matched 401(k) contributions in the form of Company stock at 50% of an employee's annual contribution to the plan up to 4% of base earnings for an effective maximum Company contribution of 2% of base earnings.
794619_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Beginning in fiscal 2013, as part of the realignment of its retirement plans, the Company increased the match on 401(k) contributions in the form of Company stock to 100% of an employee s annual contribution to the plan up to 4% of base earnings.
794619_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	The expense for 401(k) matching contributions for this plan was $2,547,000, $1,284,000 and $1,272,000, in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
794619_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	These plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average earnings (for salaried employees) or benefit rate (for hourly employees).
794619_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salary defined benefit pension plans.
794619_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at April 30, 2013 is $52.7 million ($32.1 million net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension benefit costs.
794619_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Company expects to recognize $1.1 million ($0.7 million net of tax) in net actuarial losses in net periodic pension benefit costs during fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	The Company uses an April 30 measurement date for its benefit plans.
794619_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company s non-contributory defined benefit pension plans as of April 30:
794619_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for both pension plans was $149,429,000 and $136,264,000 at April 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
794619_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	Actuarial Assumptions : The discount rate at April 30 was used to measure the year-end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year.
794619_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and earnings effects for the pension plans follow:
794619_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	In fiscal 2013 and 2012, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Aon Hewitt AA Bond Universe Yield Curve.
794619_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	In fiscal 2011, the Company referred to the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve in establishing the discount rate.
794619_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	This change was caused by the merger of Aon and Hewitt and the corresponding elimination of the Hewitt Above Median Yield Curve.
794619_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions.
794619_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	The Company also considered the related historical ten-year average asset returns at April 30, 2013.
794619_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company amortizes experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, over the average remaining lifetime of the active participants.
794619_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Contributions: The Company funds the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts the Company deems appropriate.
794619_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company expects to contribute $2.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2014.
794619_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company made contributions of $4.9 million and $2.9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.
794619_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Estimated Future Benefit Payments : The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid:
794619_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Plan Assets: Pension assets by major category and the type of fair value measurement as of April 30, 2013 and 2012 are presented in the following tables:
794619_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with its pension plans.
794619_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	The objectives of the investment strategies include preservation of capital and long-term growth of capital while avoiding excessive risk.
794619_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by the Company s Pension Committee.
794619_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and occasionally the Pension Committee will approve allocations above or below a target range.
794619_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	During a period of uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets, the Pension Committee may suspend the Target Asset Allocation and manage the investment mix as it sees reasonable, prudent and in the best interest of the plans to better protect the value of the plan assets.
794619_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company s pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at April 30, 2013 and 2012, by asset category, were as follows:
794619_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Within the broad categories outlined in the preceding table, the Company has targeted the following specific allocations as a percentage of total funds invested: 19% Capital Preservation, 31% Bond, 20% Large Capital Growth, 20% Large Capital Value, 6% Small Capital and 4% International.
794619_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	Income tax expense was comprised of the following:

794619_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	The net operating loss carryforward value for April 30, 2013 contained in the above table includes amounts pertaining to various state net operating loss carryforwards with various expiration dates.
794619_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its gross deferred tax assets due to expected future taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.
794619_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company accounts for its income tax uncertainties in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
794619_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company had no liability relating to uncertain tax positions for the years ended April 30, 2013 and 2012.
794619_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	With minor exceptions, the Company is currently open to audit by tax authorities for tax years ending April 30, 2010 through April 30, 2013.
794619_13_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Company is currently not under federal audit.
794619_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims, and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible or remote, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	Where no loss estimate range can be made, the Company and its counsel perform a worst-case estimate.
794619_13_ITEM8_P98_S3	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of April 30, 2013.
794619_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.
794619_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	The warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.
794619_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	warranty claim experience differs from estimates.
794619_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	Warranty claims are generally made within two months of the original shipment date.
794619_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the Company s warranty liability:

794619_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
794619_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
794619_13_ITEM8_P134_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

794619_13_ITEM8_P134_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
794619_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
794619_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
794619_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
794619_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

794619_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	American Woodmark s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company services these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of nine service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.

794619_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	Other raw materials are purchased from more than one source and are readily available.
794619_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers.
794619_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality.
794619_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.
794619_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	General economic forces and changes in the Company s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material.
794619_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage.
794619_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio of well below 20%, and working capital exclusive of cash of less than 6% of net sales.
794619_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	At April 30, 201 4 , debt to capital was 9.7 %, and working capital net of cash was 1. 8 % of net sales.
794619_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	During the last fiscal year, American Woodmark had two primary customers, The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc., which together accounted for approximately 4 9 % of the Company s sales in its fiscal year ended April 30, 201 4 (fiscal 201 4 ).
794619_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
794619_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	As of May 31, 201 4 , the Company had 4,9 1 6 employees.
794619_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	None of the Company s employees are represented by labor unions.

794619_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or currently believed to be immaterial also may adversely impact the Company s business.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings Forward-Looking Statements, Seasonality , and Outlook for Fiscal 201 5 .
794619_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company s business is dependent upon remodeling activity and residential construction.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The Company s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Prolonged economic downturns may adversely impact the Company s sales, earnings and liquidity.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although they have recently rebounded , the Company s fiscal 201 4 sales levels were 13 % below their peak levels of 2006.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company s industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During economic downturns, the Company s industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The Company believes that its industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors not only may affect the ultimate consumer of the Company s products, but also may impact home centers, builders and the Company s other primary customers.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, a worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect the Company s sales and earnings as well as its cash flow and liquidity.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company s future financial performance depends in part on the success of its new product development and other growth strategies.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus solely on organic growth.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, the Company s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The loss of, or a reduction in business from, either of the Company s key customers would have a material adverse effect upon its business.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The size and importance to the Company of its two largest customers is significant.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc. were approximately 4 9 % of total company sales for fiscal 201 4 .
794619_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although builders, dealers, and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Manufacturing expansion to add capacity could result in a decrease in the Company s near-term earnings.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company continually reviews its manufacturing operations.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These reviews could result in the expansion of capacity, functions, systems, or procedures, which in turn could result in inefficiencies for a period that would decrease near-term earnings until the additional capacity is in place and fully operating.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, downturns in the economy could potentially have a larger impact on the Company as a result of this added capacity.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Impairment charges could reduce the Company s profitability.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company has significant long-lived assets, including deferred tax assets, recorded on its balance sheets.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If operating results decline or if the Company decides to restructure its operations as it did with the 2012 Restructuring Plan, the Company could incur impairment charges, which could have a material impact on its financial results.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets on an ongoing basis.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The outcome of future reviews could result in substantial impairment charges.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Future events and changing market conditions may impact the Company s assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may result in changes in the Company s estimates.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company s operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Because the Company is dependent on outside suppliers for raw material needs, it must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from its suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to inflation and increasing costs.
794619_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.

794619_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition, American Woodmark owns a manufacturing facility that is permanently closed.
794619_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company accounts for these loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450.
794619_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of estimated loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of April 30, 201 4 .
794619_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	Also see the information under Legal Matters under Note K Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report under Item 8 .

794619_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	In addition, the Company participates in an industry that is subject to rapidly changing conditions and there are numerous factors that could cause the Company to experience a decline in sales and/or earnings or deterioration in financial condition.
794619_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements made in this report include but are not limited to:
794619_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	sales growth at a rate that outpaces the Company s ability to install new capacity or a sales decline that requires reduction or realignment of the Company s manufacturing capacity.
794619_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements is contained in this annual report, including elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and under Item 1A .

794619_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	While the Company believes that these risks are manageable and will not adversely impact the long-term performance of the Company, these risks could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition.

794619_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
794619_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	American Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors.
794619_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	At April 30, 2014, the Company operated 9 manufacturing facilities and 9 service centers across the country.
794619_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	During the Company s fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2014 (fiscal 2014), the Company continued to experience improving housing market conditions during the first half of fiscal 2014 and generally flat market conditions during the second half of fiscal 2014 as the recovery from the housing market downturn that began in 2007 stalled.
794619_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	A number of positive factors evidenced the improving housing market, including:
794619_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Cabinet sales, as reported by members of the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA), increased by 1 9 % during fiscal 201 4 , suggesting an increase in both new construction and remodeling sales of cabinets.
794619_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Despite these positive factors, the Company is still f aced with a stagnant remodeling market and the Company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize sales promotions in the Company s product category during fiscal 2014 to boost sales.
794619_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Company strives to maintain its promotional levels in line with market activity, with a goal of remaining competitive.
794619_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company experienced promotional levels during fiscal 2014 that were slightly lower than those experienced in its prior fiscal year.
794619_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Company s remodeling sales were relatively flat during fiscal 2014 in a remodeling market that appears to have improved slightly.
794619_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company increased its net sales by 15% during fiscal 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company realized strong sales gains in its new construction channel during fiscal 2014, where sales increased by more than 30%, significantly outpacing the improvement in single-family housing starts.
794619_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Management believes this result indicates the Company realized market share gains in the new construction sales channel during fiscal 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company announced several initiatives designed to reduce its cost base (the 2012 Restructuring), including the permanent closure of two manufacturing plants, the decision to sell a previously closed manufacturing facility, and the realignment of its retirement program, including the freezing of its pension plans.
794619_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	fiscal 2013, and restructuring charges related to these actions have been reflected in the Company s results for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 .
794619_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company recorded restructuring charges of $1.4 million (pre-tax) and $0.9 million (after-tax) during fiscal 2013 and $(0.2) million (pre-tax) and $(0.1) million (after-tax) during fiscal 2014 in connection with these initiatives.
794619_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Because the bulk of these restructuring efforts have been completed, the Company expects that its future out-of-pocket costs will be nominal.
794619_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Company sold a previously closed plant during fiscal 2013 and another previously closed plant during fiscal 2014 and continues to include in Other Assets an aggregate $1.0 million book value for the remaining plant held for sale that was included in the 2012 Restructuring.
794619_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2014 was 17.1%, improved from 16.3% in fiscal 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in the Company s gross margin rate was driven by the beneficial impact of increased sales volume , favorable sales mix and efficiencies in freight, labor and overhead, which more than offset the impact of rising materials costs.
794619_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company had a history of profitable operations for 16 consecutive years, from 1994 to 2009, followed by losses that coincided with the industry downturn from 2010 to 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	As of April 30, 2014, the Company had total deferred tax assets of $ 29.9 million, down from $ 39.2 million at April 30, 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Growth in the Company s deferred tax assets in recent fiscal years prior to fiscal 2013 resulted primarily from growth in its defined benefit pension liabilities and the impact of its recent losses prior to fiscal 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Company earned sufficient net income during fiscal 2013 to fully utilize its Federal net operating loss carryforward.
794619_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	To fully realize its remaining net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to, among other things, substantially reduce its unfunded pension obligation of $41.5 million at April 30, 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	The Company took definitive actions when it froze its pension plans as part of the 2012 Restructuring to enhance the probability that this objective is achieved in the future.
794619_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company resumed the funding of its pension plans during fiscal year 2012, and expects to continue funding these plans for the foreseeable future, which will reduce both its unfunded pension plan obligation and its deferred tax asset.
794619_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	These actions, coupled with the recent improvement in the U.S. housing market and the Company s continued ability to grow its sales at a faster rate than its competitors, have enabled the Company to generate net income and reduce its deferred tax assets and unfunded pension obligation during fiscal 2013 and 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company believes that the positive evidence of the housing industry improvement, coupled with the benefits from the Company s successful restructuring and continued market share gains have already driven a return to profitability that is expected to continue, and that the combined impact of these positive factors outweighs the negative factor of the Company s previous losses.
794619_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Accordingly, Management has concluded it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets.
794619_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company also regularly assesses its long-lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred.
794619_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	The Company has c oncluded that none of the long-lived assets pertaining to its 9 manufacturing plants or any of its other long-lived assets were impaired as of April 30, 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Net sales were $726.5 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $96.1 million, or 15%, compared with fiscal 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Company s increased new construction volume.
794619_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Average revenue per unit increased 5% in fiscal 2014, driven by improvements in the Company s sales mix and pricing.
794619_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2013 increased 22% to $630.4 million from $515.8 million in fiscal 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2013 was 17% higher than in fiscal 2012, which management believes was driven primarily by the Company s increased market share.
794619_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 4% during fiscal 2013, driven primarily by improvements in product mix.
794619_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 17.1% in fiscal 2014 as compared with 16.3% in fiscal 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of higher sales volume and improved labor efficiency.
794619_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	This favorability was partially offset by an increase in material costs.
794619_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Overhead and installation costs increased by 1.0% as a percentage of net sales as compared with fiscal 2013 due to increased spending for infrastructure to support higher levels of anticipated sales and installation activity.
794619_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	This increase was partially offset by the increased sales volume as increased utilization resulted in leverage on our semi-fixed and fixed costs.
794619_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	During fiscal 2013, the Company s gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to 16.3% from 12.9% in fiscal 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of higher sales volume and labor and overhead cost savings associated with the Company s two plant closures in April and May of 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	This favorability was partially offset by an increase in material costs.
794619_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	Specific changes and additional information included:
794619_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Sales promotion costs improved by 1.4% of net sales during fiscal 2013 compared with the prior year, as a result of both an increased proportion of new construction sales to the Company s total sales and re duced promotional activity.
794619_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2014 were 8.2% of net sales, compared with 9.1% of net sales in fiscal 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Selling and marketing costs increased by 4% despite a 15% increase in net sales.
794619_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	The improvement in sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to reduced spending on product launch costs, which were offset in part by increased sales compensation and staffing costs related to the Company s increased sales levels.
794619_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were 9.1% of net sales in fiscal 2013 compared with 11.3% in fiscal 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The improvement in sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to reduced spending on product launch costs and cost reductions related to the Company s retirement plan changes, which were offset in part by increased sales compensation and staffing costs related to the Company s increased sales levels .
794619_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	General and administrative expenses increased by $3.3 million or 12% during fiscal 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in cost was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation and one-time personnel related costs.
794619_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	However, general and administrative costs declined to 4.3% of net sales in fiscal 2014 compared with 4.4% of net sales in fiscal 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2013 increased by $2.2 million, or 9%, compared with fiscal 2012 and represented 4.4% of net sales, compared with 4.9% of net sales for fiscal 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in cost was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation.
794619_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company generated pre-tax income of $33.7 million during fiscal 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Company s effective tax rate decreased from 41.7% in fiscal 2013 to 39.2% in fiscal 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	The lower effective tax rate was the result of the Company operating at a higher net income than the prior year period and more favorable permanent tax differences.
794619_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company tracks several metrics, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence, which it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company believes that housing prices will continue to improve, driven by employment growth and a resumption of growth in new household formation.
794619_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	However, the Company expects that while the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement during fiscal 2015 it will continue to be below historical averages.
794619_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Company expects that industry-wide cabinet remodeling sales will continue to be challenged until economic trends remain consistently favorable.
794619_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Growth is expected at roughly a mid-single digit rate during the Company s fiscal 2015.
794619_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	The Company expects that its home center market share will be relatively stable in fiscal 2015 and it will continue to gain market share in its growing dealer business.
794619_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	This combination is expected to result in remodeling sales growth that reflects the market.
794619_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company believes, based on available information, that new construction starts will grow double digit during its fiscal 2015 with stronger growth projected in the second half of the year.
794619_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The Company s new construction sales growth outperformed the new construction market during fiscal 2014, and expects that it will again outperform the new construction market during fiscal 2015 but by a lesser rate than fiscal 2014, as its comparable prior year sales levels become more challenging.
794619_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements, the Company expects that it will grow its total sales at a mid-teen rate in fiscal 2015.
794619_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company experienced material inflation throughout fiscal 2014 as well as negative impacts in the third and fourth quarter from our decision to retain crewing and infrastructure to support our new construction business.
794619_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Although material inflation will continue in fiscal 2015, the Company expects that its gross margin rate and net income for fiscal 2015 will improve compared with its fiscal 2014 performance.
794619_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company had gross outlays for capital expenditures and customer display units of $11.4 million during fiscal 2014, and plans to increase its base spending level during fiscal 2015.
794619_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	However, the Company is undertaking a multi-year review of its manufacturing capacity and capital expenditure plans which could cause its capital expenditures to exceed this base level.
794619_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this annual report, including under Forward-Looking Statements, and elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , as well as under Item 1A .

794619_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities.
794619_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Company also has a $35 million secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which expires on December 31, 2015.
794619_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	This facility had an available borrowing base of $25 million at April 30, 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was $40.5 million, compared with $24.5 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The $16.0 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $10.7 million improvement in net income and a $3.5 million decrease in cash used for the Company s working capital investment in inventory and customer receivables.
794619_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was $24.5 million, compared with $16.1 million in fiscal 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The $8.4 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $22.9 million improvement in net income and reduction in asset impairments related to the 2012 Restructuring.
794619_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	This improvement was offset in part by a $13.6 million net working capital investment in the Company s operating assets and liabilities to fund growth and increased contributions to its pension plans of $2.0 million.
794619_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company s investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays.

794619_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	Investments in promotional displays were $3.5 million in fiscal 2014, compared with $4.8 million in fiscal 2013 and $3.3 million in fiscal 2012 .
794619_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	The level s of investment in property, plant and equipment and promotional displays decreased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to a decrease in the enhancements made to machinery and equipment during the fiscal year and a decrease in the number of display units deployed with customers in fiscal 2014.
794619_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	During fiscal 2014, the Company s increased net cash used for investing activities was driven by a $5.7 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets from closed plants and insurance proceeds compared to the prior year, offset by the aggregate $2.2 million decrease in outflows for capital expenditures and promotional displays.
794619_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company generated positive free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities) of $30.9 million during fiscal 2014, compared with $18.4 million in fiscal 2013 and $6.1 million in fiscal 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in fiscal 2014 was driven by the net improvements in cash provided by operating activities, which more than offset the increased net outflows used for investing activities.
794619_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increase in fiscal 2013 was driven by the net improvements in both cash provided by operating activities and decreased net outflows used for investing activities.
794619_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company realized a net inflow of $7.8 million from financing activities in fiscal 2014, compared with $11.9 million in fiscal 2013, and $5.1 million in fiscal 2012.

794619_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The revolving credit facility does not limit the Company s ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the Company is in compliance with these covenants.
794619_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal 2015.

794619_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the Company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported.
794619_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.
794619_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
794619_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
794619_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability.
794619_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit total exposure.
794619_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company establishes a liability at each balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salar ied defined benefit pension plans.
794619_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The estimated expense, benefits and pension obligations of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations.
794619_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	In fiscal 2014 and 2013, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Aon Hewitt AA Bond Universe Yield Curve.
794619_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	The following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical 1% change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and consumer price index:
794619_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2014 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note H of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	At April 30, 2014, the discount rate was 4.56% compared with 4.21% at April 30, 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	The expected return on plan assets was 7.5% at both April 30, 2014, and April 30, 2013.
794619_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	The rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond April 30, 2012 because the Company froze its pension plans as of that date.
794619_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The projected performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have resulted from changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to a current market rate at each annual measurement date.
794619_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	From the fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 4.66% at April 30, 2012 to 4.21% at April 30, 2013, which caused an actuarial loss of $10.8 million.
794619_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	From the fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 measurement dates, the discount rate increased from 4.21% to 4.56% which caused an actuarial gain of $7.6 million.
794619_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants.
794619_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees, were 9.4%, 10.2% and 3.1% for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
794619_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2014 was $102.6 million compared with $95.7 million at April 30, 2013.

794619_14_ITEM8_P130_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
794619_14_ITEM8_P130_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
794619_14_ITEM8_P130_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
794619_14_ITEM8_P130_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
794619_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
794619_14_ITEM8_P131_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
794619_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
794619_14_ITEM8_P132_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
794619_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	In our opinion, American Woodmark Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

794619_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation ( American Woodmark or the Company ) manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	American Woodmark was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division.
794619_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	American Woodmark was operated privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a registered public offering of its common stock.
794619_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in approximately 500 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles.
794619_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Styles vary by design and color from natural wood finishes to low-pressure laminate surfaces.
794619_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	The product offering of stock cabinets includes 85 door designs in 21 colors.
794619_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stock cabinets consist of cabinet interiors of varying dimensions and construction options and a maple, oak, cherry, or hickory front frame, door and/or drawer front.
794619_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark , Timberlake , Shenandoah Cabinetry , Shenandoah Value Series , and Waypoint Living Spaces .
794619_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	American Woodmark s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company services these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of seven service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.
794619_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company distributes its products to each market channel directly from four assembly plants through a third party logistics network.
794619_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	The primary raw materials used include hard maple, oak, cherry, soft maple, and hickory lumber and plywood.
794619_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, medium density fiberboard, high density fiberboard, manufactured components, and hardware.
794619_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company currently purchases paint from one supplier; however, other sources are available.
794619_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	Other raw materials are purchased from more than one source and are readily available.
794619_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers.
794619_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality.
794619_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.
794619_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	General economic forces and changes in the Company s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material.
794619_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage.
794619_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio of well below 20%, and working capital exclusive of cash of less than 6% of net sales.
794619_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	At April 30, 2015, debt to capital was 8.6%, and working capital net of cash was 1.8% of net sales.
794619_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	During the last fiscal year, American Woodmark had two primary customers, The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc., which together accounted for approximately 45% of the Company s sales in its fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 (fiscal 2015).
794619_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

794619_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The contents of the Company s web site are not, however, part of this report.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or currently believed to be immaterial also may adversely impact the Company s business.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings Forward-Looking Statements, Seasonality, and Outlook for Fiscal 2016.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company s business is dependent upon remodeling activity and residential construction.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The Company s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Prolonged economic downturns may adversely impact the Company s sales, earnings and liquidity.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company s industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During economic downturns, the Company s industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The Company believes that its industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors not only may affect the ultimate consumer of the Company s products, but also may impact home centers, builders and the Company s other primary customers.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, a worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect the Company s sales and earnings as well as its cash flow and liquidity.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company s future financial performance depends in part on the success of its new product development and other growth strategies.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus solely on organic growth.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, the Company s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The loss of, or a reduction in business from, either of the Company s key customers would have a material adverse effect upon its business.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The size and importance to the Company of its two largest customers are significant.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc. were approximately 45% of total company sales for fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although builders, dealers, and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Manufacturing expansion to add capacity could result in a decrease in the Company s near-term earnings.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company continually reviews its manufacturing operations.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These reviews could result in the expansion of capacity, functions, systems, or procedures, which in turn could result in inefficiencies for a period that would decrease near-term earnings until the additional capacity is in place and fully operating.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, downturns in the economy could potentially have a larger impact on the Company as a result of this added capacity.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Impairment charges could reduce the Company s profitability.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company has significant long-lived assets, including deferred tax assets, recorded on its balance sheets.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If operating results decline or if the Company decides to restructure its operations as it did with the 2012 Restructuring Plan, the Company could incur impairment charges, which could have a material impact on its financial results.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets on an ongoing basis.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The outcome of future reviews could result in substantial impairment charges.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment assessments inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about market conditions and the Company s ability to generate future cash flows and profitability, given those assumptions.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Future events and changing market conditions may impact the Company s assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may result in changes in the Company s estimates.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company s operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Because the Company is dependent on outside suppliers for raw material needs, it must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from its suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to inflation and increasing costs.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company's operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company relies on a number of information technology systems to process, transmit, store and manage information to support its business activities.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to its information technology systems.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company has established security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of its systems and information and disruption of its operations.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Despite these efforts, systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances the Company's disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to the Company's reputation, exposure to litigation, and increased operational costs.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Such events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation.
794619_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, the Company could be adversely affected if any of its significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.
794619_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	American Woodmark leases its Corporate Office located in Winchester, Virginia.
794619_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition, the Company leases 1 manufacturing facility in Hardy County, West Virginia and owns 8 manufacturing facilities located primarily in the eastern United States.
794619_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also leases 7 primary service centers, 7 satellite service centers, and 3 additional office centers located throughout the United States that support the sale and distribution of products to each market channel.
794619_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	The Company considers its properties suitable for the business and adequate for its needs.
794619_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation, product liability and general liability claims and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company accounts for these loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450.
794619_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of estimated loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of April 30, 2015.
794619_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	Also see the information under Legal Matters under Note K Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report under Item 8.

794619_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the AMWD symbol.
794619_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Common stock per share market prices and cash dividends declared during the last two fiscal years were as follows:
794619_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of May 21, 2015, there were approximately 8,900 shareholders of record of the Company's common stock.

794619_15_ITEM5_P1_S3	The determination as to the payment of future dividends will be made by the Board of Directors from time to time and will depend on the Company's then current financial condition, capital requirements, results of operations and any other factors then deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.
794619_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following table sets forth certain income and expense items as a percentage of net sales:
794619_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report.
794619_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	This annual report contains statements concerning the Company s expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts.
794619_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	These statements may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	In most cases, the reader can identify forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, estimate, forecast, expect, believe, should, could, would, plan, may, "intend," "estimate," "prospect," "goal," "will," "predict," "potential" or other similar words.

794619_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, the Company participates in an industry that is subject to rapidly changing conditions and there are numerous factors that could cause the Company to experience a decline in sales and/or earnings or deterioration in financial condition.
794619_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements made in this report include but are not limited to:
794619_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	sales growth at a rate that outpaces the Company s ability to install new capacity or a sales decline that requires reduction or realignment of the Company s manufacturing capacity.
794619_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements is contained in this annual report, including elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and under Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
794619_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	While the Company believes that these risks are manageable and will not adversely impact the long-term performance of the Company, these risks could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition.
794619_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Any forward-looking statement that the Company makes speaks only as of the date of this annual report.
794619_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
794619_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	American Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors.
794619_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	At April 30, 2015, the Company operated 9 manufacturing facilities and 7 service centers across the country.
794619_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	During the Company s fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2015 (fiscal 2015), the Company continued to experience improving housing market conditions from the housing market downturn that began in 2007.
794619_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	A number of positive factors evidenced the improving housing market, including:
794619_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Cabinet sales, as reported by members of the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA), increased by 6% during fiscal 2015, suggesting an increase in both new construction and remodeling sales of cabinets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize sales promotions in the Company s product category during fiscal 2015 to boost sales.
794619_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Company strives to maintain its promotional levels in line with market activity, with a goal of remaining competitive.
794619_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company experienced promotional levels during fiscal 2015 that were slightly higher than those experienced in its prior fiscal year.
794619_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Company s remodeling sales increased high single digits during fiscal 2015, consistent with the overall remodeling market.
794619_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company increased its net sales by 14% during fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company realized strong sales gains in its new construction channel during fiscal 2015, where sales increased by more than 19%, outpacing the improvement in single-family housing starts.
794619_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Management believes this result indicates the Company realized market share gains in the new construction sales channel during fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company announced several initiatives designed to reduce its cost base (the 2012 Restructuring), including the permanent closure of two manufacturing plants, the decision to sell a previously closed manufacturing facility, and the realignment of its retirement program, including the freezing of its pension plans.
794619_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	completed either prior to or just after the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2013, and restructuring charges related to these actions have been reflected in the Company s results for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company recorded restructuring charges of $(0.2) million (pre-tax) and $(0.1) million (after-tax) during fiscal 2014 and $(0.2) million (pre-tax) and $(0.1) million (after-tax) during fiscal 2015 in connection with these initiatives.
794619_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company sold a previously closed plant during fiscal 2014 and sold the remaining plant held for sale during fiscal 2015 that were included in the 2012 Restructuring.
794619_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2015 was 18.5%, an improvement from 17.1% in fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in the Company s gross margin rate was driven by the beneficial impact of increased sales volume and improved operating efficiency, which more than offset the impact of rising materials costs and costs associated with crewing and infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and installation activity.
794619_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company had a history of profitable operations for 16 consecutive years, from 1994 to 2009, followed by losses that coincided with the industry downturn from 2010 to 2012.
794619_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	As of April 30, 2015, the Company had total deferred tax assets of $37.3 million, up from $29.9 million at April 30, 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Growth in the Company s deferred tax assets in recent fiscal years resulted primarily from growth in its defined benefit pension liabilities and the impact of its recent losses prior to fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	To fully realize its remaining net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to, among other things, substantially reduce its unfunded pension obligation of $61.3 million at April 30, 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	The Company took definitive actions when it froze its pension plans as part of the 2012 Restructuring to enhance the probability that this objective is achieved in the future.
794619_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company resumed the funding of its pension plans during fiscal year 2012, and expects to continue funding these plans for the foreseeable future, which will reduce both its unfunded pension plan obligation and its deferred tax asset.
794619_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	These actions, coupled with the recent improvement in the U.S. housing market and the Company s continued ability to grow its sales at a faster rate than its competitors, have enabled the Company to generate net income and reduce its deferred tax assets and unfunded pension obligation during fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company's deferred tax assets increased in fiscal 2015 due to an increase in the unfunded pension obligation, as a result of a decrease in the discount rate and the Company updating to the new RP-2014 mortality tables.
794619_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company believes that the positive evidence of the housing industry improvement, coupled with the benefits from the Company s successful restructuring and continued market share gains have already driven a return to profitability that is expected to continue, and that the combined impact of these positive factors outweighs the negative factor of the Company s previous losses.
794619_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Accordingly, Management has concluded it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company also regularly assesses its long-lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred.
794619_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company has concluded that none of the long-lived assets pertaining to its 9 manufacturing plants or any of its other long-lived assets were impaired as of April 30, 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net sales were $825.5 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $99.0 million, or 14%, compared with fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2015 was 6% higher than in fiscal 2014, which was driven primarily by the Company s increased new construction volume.
794619_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 7% in fiscal 2015, driven by improvements in the Company s product mix and pricing.
794619_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2014 increased 15% to $726.5 million from $630.4 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2014 was 10% higher than in fiscal 2013, which management believes was driven primarily by the Company s increased new construction volume.
794619_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 5% during fiscal 2014, driven by improvements in the Company's sales mix and pricing.
794619_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 18.5% in fiscal 2015 as compared with 17.1% in fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of higher sales volume and improved labor efficiency.
794619_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	This favorability was partially offset by an increase in material costs, costs associated with crewing and infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and installation activity and inventory costs associated with new product launches.
794619_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	During fiscal 2014, the Company s gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to 17.1% from 16.3% in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of higher sales volume and improved labor efficiency.
794619_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	This favorability was partially offset by an increase in material costs, costs associated with crewing and infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and installation activity.
794619_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2015 were 7.8% of net sales, compared with 8.2% of net sales in fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Selling and marketing costs increased by 8% despite a 14% increase in net sales.
794619_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	The improvement in sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to favorable leverage from increased sales and on-going expense control.
794619_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were 8.2% of net sales in fiscal 2014 compared with 9.1% in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The improvement in sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to reduced spending on product launch costs, which were offset in part by increased sales compensation and staffing costs related to the Company s increased sales levels.
794619_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	General and administrative expenses increased by $2.9 million or 9% during fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in cost was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation and staffing costs.
794619_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	However, the Company generated leverage as general and administrative costs declined to 4.1% of net sales in fiscal 2015 compared with 4.3% of net sales in fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2014 increased by $3.3 million, or 12%, compared with fiscal 2013 and represented 4.3% of net sales, compared with 4.4% of net sales for fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in cost was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation and one-time personnel costs.
794619_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company generated pre-tax income of $54.4 million during fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company s effective tax rate decreased from 39.2% in fiscal 2014 to 34.7% in fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	The lower effective tax rate was the result of the Company operating at a higher net income than the prior year period and more favorable permanent tax differences, including finalizing a federal research and experimentation tax credit for fiscal years 2011 through 2014 of $1.2 million.
794619_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company tracks several metrics, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence, which it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company believes that housing starts will continue to improve, driven by lower unemployment rates and a resumption of growth in new household formation.
794619_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	However, the Company expects that while the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement during fiscal 2016 it will continue to be below historical averages.
794619_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company expects that industry-wide cabinet remodeling sales will continue to be challenged until economic trends remain consistently favorable.
794619_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Growth is expected at roughly a low-single digit rate during the Company s fiscal 2016.
794619_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	The Company expects that its home center market share will be relatively stable in fiscal 2016 and it will continue to gain market share in its growing dealer business.
794619_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	This combination is expected to result in remodeling sales growth that reflects the market.
794619_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company believes, based on available information, that new residential construction starts will grow 8 to 10% during its fiscal year.
794619_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company s new residential construction sales growth outperformed the new residential construction market during fiscal 2015, and management expects that it will again outperform the new residential construction market during fiscal 2016 but by a lesser rate than fiscal 2015, as its comparable prior year sales levels become more challenging.
794619_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements, the Company expects that it will grow its total sales at a low-teen rate in fiscal 2016.
794619_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Despite anticipated material inflation and impacts in the second half of fiscal 2016 for the West Virginia plant expansion, the Company expects that its gross margin rate and net income for fiscal 2016 will improve compared with its fiscal 2015 performance.
794619_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company had gross outlays for capital expenditures and customer display units of $22.4 million during fiscal 2015, and plans to increase its base spending level during fiscal 2016 along with the carryover spending associated with its facility expansion in West Virginia.
794619_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this annual report, including under Forward-Looking Statements, and elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as under Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
794619_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company s cash, cash equivalents and investments in certificates of deposit totaled $185.0 million at April 30, 2015, which represented an increase of $49.3 million from April 30, 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Total debt was $23.0 million at April 30, 2015, an increase of $1.4 million over the prior fiscal year and long-term debt, excluding current maturities, to capital was 8.6% at April 30, 2015, down from 9.7% at April 30, 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities.
794619_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Company also has a $35 million unsecured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which expires on December 31, 2018.
794619_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	This facility had an available borrowing base of $25 million at April 30, 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Effective September 1, 2014, Wells Fargo amended the Company's credit facility to extend the maturity date for borrowings outstanding under the credit facility from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2018; provide the line of credit is unsecured; modify the interest on the outstanding principal balance of the note as either (i) a fluctuating rate per annum determined by Wells Fargo to be the daily one month LIBOR rate in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin, or (ii) a fixed rate per annum determined by Wells Fargo to be the index above LIBOR in effect on the first day of the applicable Fixed Rate Term; lower the unused commitment fee from 0.30% to 0.15%; and establish a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than 1.5 to 1.0 measured at the end of each fiscal quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis.
794619_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was $58.7 million, compared with $40.5 million in fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The $18.2 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $15.0 million improvement in net income and a $5.1 million decrease in cash used for the Company s working capital investment in inventory and customer receivables.
794619_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was $40.5 million, compared with $24.5 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The $16.0 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $10.7 million improvement in net income and a $3.5 million decrease in cash used for the Company's working capital investment in inventory and customer receivables.
794619_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company s investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays.
794619_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Net cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2015 was $56.6 million, compared with $9.6 million in fiscal 2014 and $6.1 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	Investments in property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2015 were $20.0 million, compared with $7.9 million in fiscal 2014 and $8.9 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	Investments in promotional displays were $2.4 million in fiscal 2015, compared with $3.5 million in fiscal 2014 and $4.8 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P42_S4	The levels of investment in property, plant and equipment and promotional displays increased during fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	On August 21, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $30 million capital expansion project at its West Virginia facility.
794619_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	During fiscal 2015, approximately $10.2 was incurred related to this expansion.
794619_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	During fiscal 2015, the Company s increased net cash used for investing activities was driven by a $35.5 million investment in short-term certificates of deposit and a $12.1 million increase in outflows for capital expenditures, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in outflows for promotional displays and a $0.5 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of closed plants and insurance proceeds compared to the prior year.
794619_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company generated positive free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities) of $2.1 million during fiscal 2015, compared with $30.9 million in fiscal 2014 and $18.4 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The decrease in fiscal 2015 was driven by the net improvements in cash provided by operating activities, which more than offset the increased net outflows used for investing activities that was the result of investment in short-term certificates of deposit and increased capital expenditures.
794619_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in fiscal 2014 was driven by the net improvements in cash provided by operating activities, which more than offset the increased net outflows used for investing activities.
794619_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company realized a net inflow of $11.7 million from financing activities in fiscal 2015, compared with $7.8 million in fiscal 2014, and $11.9 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Proceeds were generated from the exercise of stock options of $14.3 million in fiscal 2015, $15.3 million in fiscal 2014 and $5.9 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	During fiscal 2015 $1.3 million was used to repay long-term debt, compared with approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2014 and $1.0 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	Reductions in the amount of restricted cash previously required under the Company s credit facility drove inflows of approximately $7 million in fiscal 2013.
794619_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company ended fiscal 2015 with nearly $150 million in cash and cash equivalents.
794619_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Under a stock repurchase authorization approved by its Board of Directors on November 21, 2013, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $10 million of the Company s common shares through December 31, 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	On November 20, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional repurchase of up to $25 million of the Company's common shares.
794619_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms the Company deems appropriate and subject to the Company's cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under the Company s revolving credit facility, and other factors management deems relevant.
794619_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	At April 30, 2015, $25 million remained authorized by the Company s Board of Directors to repurchase the Company s common shares.
794619_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	The Company purchased a total of 163,326 common shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $5.1 million, during fiscal 2015, under the November 21, 2013 authorization.
794619_15_ITEM7_P48_S5	The Company continues to evaluate its cash on hand and prospects for future cash generation, and compare these against its plans for future capital expenditures.
794619_15_ITEM7_P48_S6	Although the evaluation of its future capital expenditures is ongoing, the Company expects that it will make repurchases of its common shares from time to time during fiscal 2016 subject to the Company s financial condition, capital requirements, results of operations and any other factors then deemed relevant.
794619_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company can borrow up to $35 million under the Wells Fargo credit facility, subject to a maximum borrowing base equal to 75% of eligible accounts receivable, 50% of eligible pre bill reserves and up to $20 million for equipment value (each as defined in the agreement) less any outstanding loan balance.
794619_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	At April 30, 2015, $10 million of loans and $4.0 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Wells Fargo facility, and the Company had additional borrowing base availability of $25.0 million.
794619_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	The Company s outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo are unsecured.
794619_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Any outstanding loan balance bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (0.25% at April 30, 2015) plus 1.495%.
794619_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, the Company must: (1) maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than 1.4 to 1.0; (2) maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than 1.5 to 1.0 measured on a rolling four-quarter basis; and (3) comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants.
794619_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the amended credit facility as of April 30, 2015, including as follows: (1) the Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at April 30, 2015 was 0.74 to 1.0; and (2) cash flow to fixed charges for its most recent four quarters was 3.39 to 1.0.
794619_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	The revolving credit facility does not limit the Company s ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the Company is in compliance with these covenants.
794619_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal 2016.
794619_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The timing of the Company s contractual obligations as of April 30, 2015 is summarized in the table below:
794619_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the Company s primary loan agreement and capitalized lease agreements.
794619_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Amounts outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility, $10 million at April 30, 2015, bear a variable interest rate determined by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.495%.
794619_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Interest under the Company s capitalized lease agreements is fixed at rates between 2% and 6.5%.
794619_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt for the Company s revolving credit facility are at LIBOR plus the spread as of April 30, 2015, throughout the remaining term of the facility.
794619_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The estimated cost of the Company s two defined benefit pension plans is determined annually based upon the discount rate and other assumptions at fiscal year end.
794619_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Future pension funding contributions beyond fiscal 2020 have not been determined at this time.
794619_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	For additional discussion of risks that could affect the Company and its business, see Forward-Looking Statements above, as well as Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
794619_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	As of April 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
794619_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the Company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported.
794619_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.
794619_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
794619_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
794619_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability.
794619_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit total exposure.
794619_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company establishes a liability at each balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans.
794619_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	The estimated expense, benefits and pension obligations of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations.
794619_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	The Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Aon Hewitt AA Bond Universe Yield Curve.
794619_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2015 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note H of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	At April 30, 2015, the discount rate was 4.19% compared with 4.56% at April 30, 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	The expected return on plan assets was 7.5% at both April 30, 2015, and April 30, 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	The rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond April 30, 2012 because the Company froze its pension plans as of that date.
794619_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	The projected performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have resulted from changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to a current market rate at each annual measurement date.
794619_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	From the fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 measurement dates, the discount rate increased from 4.21% at April 30, 2013 to 4.56% at April 30, 2014, which caused an actuarial gain of $7.6 million.
794619_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	From the fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 4.56% to 4.19%.
794619_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	Of the $24.2 million actuarial losses in fiscal 2015, $12.6 million were due to a reduction in the discount rate and $9.7 million were due to the Company updating its mortality estimates to the new RP-2014 mortality tables.
794619_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants.
794619_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees, were 6.6%, 9.4% and 10.2% for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
794619_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2015 was $108.7 million compared with $102.6 million at April 30, 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by $61.3 million in fiscal 2015 and by $41.5 million in fiscal 2014.
794619_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	The $19.8 million increase in the Company s net under-funded position during fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the Company s $24.2 million actuarial loss, offset by increased Company contributions.
794619_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	The Company expects its pension expense to increase from $(0.3) million in fiscal 2015 to $0.3 million in fiscal 2016, due primarily to the change to the new mortality tables and decrease in the discount rate and Company contributions.
794619_15_ITEM7_P78_S4	The Company expects to contribute $5.0 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016, which represents required and discretionary funding.
794619_15_ITEM7_P78_S5	The Company made contributions of $4.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Based upon the Company s analysis at April 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company determined in each case that a valuation allowance was not required.
794619_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	The Company considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining the need for a valuation allowance.
794619_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	Based upon this analysis, management determined that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized through expected future income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.
794619_15_ITEM7_P79_S4	The Company will continue to update this analysis on a periodic basis and changes in expectations about future income or the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences could cause the Company to record a valuation allowance in a future period.
794619_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606.
794619_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standard Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
794619_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The standard requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
794619_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
794619_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
794619_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	In April 2015, the FASB voted in favor of a one year deferral of the effective date of this amendment.
794619_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial position and results of operations.
794619_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The costs of the Company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations.
794619_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company has generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases.
794619_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	On April 30, 2015, the Company had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements.

794619_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the option grant date.
794619_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following table presents a summary of the Company s stock option activity for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (remaining contractual term in years and exercise prices are weighted-averages):

794619_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	The PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2015 are earned based on achievement of a number of goals pertaining to the Company s operational and financial performance during the performance period of fiscal 2015.
794619_15_ITEM8_P67_S3	Employees who satisfy the vesting criteria will receive a proportional amount of PBRSUs based upon the Compensation Committee s assessment of the Company s achievement of the performance criteria.

794619_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Each performance-based RSTU entitles the recipient to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock as of the payment date if applicable performance conditions are met and the recipient remains continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.
794619_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	The service-based RSTUs entitle the recipients to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock as of the payment date if they remain continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.
794619_15_ITEM8_P71_S3	The RSTUs cliff-vest three years from the grant date.
794619_15_ITEM8_P71_S4	Since the RSTUs will be settled in cash, the grant date fair value of these awards is recorded as a liability until the date of payment.
794619_15_ITEM8_P71_S5	The fair value of each cash-settled RSTU award is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and the liability is adjusted, and related expense recorded, based on the new fair value.

794619_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	These plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average earnings (for salaried employees) or benefit rate (for hourly employees).
794619_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans.
794619_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at April 30, 2015 is $67.0 million ( $40.9 million net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension benefit costs.

794619_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	The components of net periodic pension benefit cost do not include service costs or prior service costs due to the plans being frozen.
794619_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Actuarial Assumptions : The discount rate at April 30 was used to measure the year-end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year.
794619_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and earnings effects for the pension plans follow:
794619_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	In fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company determined the discount rate by referencing the Aon Hewitt AA Bond Universe Yield Curve.
794619_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled.
794619_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions.

794619_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	The objectives of the investment strategies include preservation of capital and long-term growth of capital while avoiding excessive risk.

794619_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and the Pension Committee may approve allocations above or below a target range.
794619_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	During a period of uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets, the Pension Committee may suspend the Target Asset Allocation and manage the investment mix as it sees reasonable, prudent and in the best interest of the plans to better protect the value of the plan assets.

794619_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its gross deferred tax assets due to expected future taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.

794619_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Company had no liability relating to uncertain tax positions for the years ended April 30, 2015 and 2014.
794619_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	With minor exceptions, the Company is currently open to audit by tax authorities for tax years ending April 30, 2012 through April 30, 2015.

794619_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims, and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_15_ITEM8_P106_S2	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible is not material as of April 30, 2015.
794619_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.
794619_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	The warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.
794619_15_ITEM8_P108_S2	Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates.
794619_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	Warranty claims are generally made within two months of the original shipment date.
794619_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the Company s warranty liability:

794619_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	Exhibit 32.1 CERTIFICATION Each of the undersigned hereby certifies, pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, that: 1.
794619_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Annual Report on Form 10-K of American Woodmark Corporation (the "Company") for the annual period ended April 30, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ) fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and 2.
794619_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
794619_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation ( American Woodmark or the Company ) manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	American Woodmark was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division.
794619_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	American Woodmark was operated privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a registered public offering of its common stock.
794619_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in approximately 500 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles.
794619_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Styles vary by design and color from natural wood finishes to low-pressure laminate surfaces.
794619_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	The product offering of stock cabinets includes 85 door designs in 21 colors.
794619_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stock cabinets consist of cabinet interiors of varying dimensions and construction options and a maple, oak, cherry, or hickory front frame, door and/or drawer front.
794619_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark , Simply Woodmark TM , Timberlake , Shenandoah Cabinetry , Shenandoah Value Series , and Waypoint Living Spaces .
794619_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	American Woodmark s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company services these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of seven service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.
794619_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company distributes its products to each market channel directly from four assembly plants through a third party logistics network.
794619_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The primary raw materials used include hard maple, soft maple, oak, cherry, and hickory lumber and plywood.
794619_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, medium density fiberboard, high density fiberboard, manufactured components, and hardware.
794619_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company currently purchases paint from one supplier; however, other sources are available.
794619_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	Other raw materials are purchased from more than one source and are readily available.
794619_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers.
794619_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality.
794619_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.
794619_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	General economic forces and changes in the Company s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material.
794619_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage.
794619_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio of well below 20%, and working capital exclusive of cash of less than 6% of net sales.
794619_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	At April 30, 2016, debt to capital was 7.4%, and working capital net of cash was 3.7% of net sales.
794619_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016), American Woodmark had two primary customers, The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc., which together accounted for approximately 41% of the Company s sales.
794619_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
794619_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Company holds patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing processes.
794619_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	The Company views its trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important to its business.
794619_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	As of May 31, 2016, the Company had 5,600 employees.
794619_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	None of the Company s employees are represented by labor unions.
794619_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	The Company believes that its employee relations are good.
794619_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	American Woodmark s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the Company s web site at www.americanwoodmark.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
794619_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	The contents of the Company s web site are not, however, part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or currently believed to be immaterial also may adversely impact the Company s business.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings Forward-Looking Statements, Seasonality, and Outlook for Fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company s business is dependent upon remodeling activity and residential construction.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The Company s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity and therefore significantly impact the Company's operations.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Prolonged economic downturns may adversely impact the Company s sales, earnings and liquidity.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company s industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During economic downturns, the Company s industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The Company believes that its industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors not only may affect the ultimate consumer of the Company s products, but also may impact home centers, builders and the Company s other primary customers.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, a worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect the Company s sales and earnings as well as its cash flow and liquidity.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company s future financial performance depends in part on the success of its new product development and other growth strategies.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus on organic growth.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, the Company s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The loss of, or a reduction in business from, either of the Company s key customers would have a material adverse effect upon its business.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The size and importance to the Company of its two largest customers are significant.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc. were approximately 41% of total company sales for fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although builders, dealers, and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	A significant change in the terms and conditions on which the Company does business with The Home Depot or Lowe's Companies, Inc. could also have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Manufacturing expansion to add capacity could result in a decrease in the Company s near-term earnings.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company continually reviews its manufacturing operations.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These reviews could result in the expansion of capacity, functions, systems, or procedures, which in turn could result in inefficiencies for a period that would decrease near-term earnings until the additional capacity is in place and fully operating.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, downturns in the economy could potentially have a larger impact on the Company as a result of this added capacity.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Impairment charges could reduce the Company s profitability.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company has significant long-lived assets, including deferred tax assets, recorded on its balance sheets.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If operating results decline or if the Company decides to restructure its operations as it did with the 2012 Restructuring Plan, the Company could incur impairment charges, which could have a material impact on its financial results.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets on an ongoing basis.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The outcome of future reviews could result in substantial impairment charges.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment assessments inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about market conditions and the Company s ability to generate future cash flows and profitability, given those assumptions.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Future events and changing market conditions may impact the Company s assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may result in changes in the Company s estimates.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company s operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Because the Company is dependent on outside suppliers for raw material needs, it must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from its suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to inflation and increasing costs.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary or otherwise increasing raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company's operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company relies on a number of information technology systems to process, transmit, store and manage information to support its business activities.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to its information technology systems.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company has established security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of its systems and information and disruption of its operations.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Despite these efforts, systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances the Company's disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to the Company's reputation, exposure to litigation, and increased operational costs.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Such events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, the Company could be adversely affected if any of its significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.
794619_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Company is subject to environmental regulation and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.

794619_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	During the Company s fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016), the Company continued to experience improving housing market conditions from the housing market downturn that began in 2007.
794619_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	A number of general market factors impacted the Company's business in fiscal 2016, including:
794619_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Cabinet sales, as reported by members of the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA), increased by 9% during fiscal 2016, suggesting an increase in both new construction and remodeling sales of cabinets.
794619_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize sales promotions in the Company s product category during fiscal 2016 to boost sales.
794619_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Company strives to maintain its promotional levels in line with market activity, with a goal of remaining competitive.
794619_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company experienced promotional levels during fiscal 2016 that were higher than those experienced in its prior fiscal year.
794619_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Company s remodeling sales increased by high single digits during fiscal 2016, consistent with the overall remodeling market.
794619_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company increased its net sales by 15% during fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company realized strong sales gains in its new construction channel during fiscal 2016, where sales increased by more than 20%, significantly outpacing the improvement in single-family housing starts for the same period.
794619_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Management believes the Company over indexed the market due to share penetration with our builder partners and the health of the markets where we concentrated our business during fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company announced several initiatives designed to reduce its cost base (the 2012 Restructuring), including the permanent closure of two manufacturing plants, the decision to sell a previously closed manufacturing facility, and the realignment of its retirement program, including the freezing of its pension plans.
794619_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	All of these initiatives were completed either prior to or just after the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2013, and restructuring charges related to these actions have been reflected in the Company s results for fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
794619_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	There were no restructuring charges related to these actions in fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	For more information on the 2012 Restructuring, see Note N - Restructuring Charges in Item 8.
794619_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data herein.
794619_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company recorded restructuring charges of $(0.2) million (pre-tax) and $(0.1) million (after-tax) during fiscal 2014 and $(0.2) million (pre-tax) and $(0.1) million (after-tax) during fiscal 2015 in connection with these initiatives.
794619_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Company sold a previously closed plant during fiscal 2014 and sold the remaining plant held for sale during fiscal 2015 that were included in the 2012 Restructuring.
794619_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2016 was 21.1%, an improvement from 18.5% in fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase in the Company s gross margin rate was driven by the beneficial impact of increased sales volume, customer management, product mix, pricing and improved operating efficiency, which more than offset the impact of additional depreciation costs related to the previously announced plant expansion and costs associated with crewing and infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and installation activity.
794619_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company had a history of profitable operations for 16 consecutive years, from 1994 to 2009, followed by losses that coincided with the industry downturn from 2010 to 2012.
794619_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	As of April 30, 2016, the Company had total deferred tax assets of $41.3 million, up from $37.3 million at April 30, 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Growth in the Company s deferred tax assets in recent fiscal years resulted primarily from growth in its defined benefit pension liabilities and the impact of its recent losses prior to fiscal 2013.
794619_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	To fully realize its remaining net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to, among other things, substantially reduce its unfunded pension obligation of $67.1 million at April 30, 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	The Company took definitive actions when it froze its pension plans as part of the 2012 Restructuring to enhance the probability that this objective is achieved in the future.
794619_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards during fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company resumed the funding of its pension plans during fiscal year 2012, and expects to continue funding these plans for the foreseeable future, which will reduce both its unfunded pension plan obligation and its deferred tax asset.
794619_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	These actions, coupled with the recent improvement in the U.S. housing market and the Company s continued ability to grow its sales at a faster rate than its competitors, have enabled the Company to generate net income during fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Company's deferred tax assets increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to an increase in the unfunded pension obligation, as a result of a decrease in the discount rate and the Company updating to the new RP-2014 mortality tables, with generational MP-2015 projections.
794619_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company believes that the positive evidence of the housing industry improvement, coupled with the benefits from the Company s successful restructuring and continued market share gains have already driven a return to profitability that is expected to continue, and that the combined impact of these positive factors outweighs the negative factor of the Company s previous losses.
794619_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Accordingly, Management has concluded it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets.
794619_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company also regularly assesses its long-lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred.
794619_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company has concluded that none of the long-lived assets pertaining to its nine manufacturing plants or any of its other long-lived assets were impaired as of April 30, 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net sales were $947.0 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $121.6 million, or 15%, compared with fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2016 was 12% higher than in fiscal 2015, which was driven primarily by the Company s increased new construction and dealer volume.
794619_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 3% in fiscal 2016, driven by improvements in the Company s product mix and pricing.
794619_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased 14% to $825.5 million from $726.5 million in fiscal 2014.
794619_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2015 was 6% higher than in fiscal 2014, which was driven primarily by the Company s increased new construction volume.
794619_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 7% during fiscal 2015, driven by improvements in the Company's product mix and pricing.
794619_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 21.1% in fiscal 2016 as compared with 18.5% in fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of increased sales volume, customer management, product mix, pricing and improved operating efficiency.
794619_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	This favorability was partially offset by the impact of additional depreciation costs related to the previously announced plant expansion and costs associated with crewing and infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and installation activity.
794619_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	During fiscal 2015, the Company s gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to 18.5% from 17.1% in fiscal 2014.
794619_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of higher sales volume and improved labor efficiency.
794619_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	This favorability was partially offset by an increase in material costs, costs associated with crewing and infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and installation activity and inventory costs associated with new product launches.
794619_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2016 were 7.0% of net sales, compared with 7.8% of net sales in fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Selling and marketing costs increased only by 3% despite a 15% increase in net sales.
794619_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	The improvement in the percentage of sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to favorable leverage from increased sales, on-going expense control and lower display and product launch costs.
794619_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were 7.8% of net sales in fiscal 2015 compared with 8.2% in fiscal 2014.
794619_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The improvement in sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to due to favorable leverage from increased sales and on-going expense control.
794619_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	General and administrative expenses increased by $6.3 million or 18.6% during fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in cost was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation and staffing costs.
794619_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	General and administrative costs increased to 4.3% of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with 4.1% of net sales in fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 increased by $2.9 million, or 9.4%, compared with fiscal 2014 and represented 4.1% of net sales, compared with 4.3% of net sales for fiscal 2014.
794619_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in cost was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation and staffing costs.
794619_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company generated pre-tax income of $91.8 million during fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company s effective tax rate increased from 34.7% in fiscal 2015 to 36.0% in fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The higher effective tax rate was the result of the Company operating at a higher net income level than the prior year period and less favorable permanent tax differences.
794619_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	The Company finalized a federal research and experimentation tax credit for fiscal years 2011 through 2014 of $1.2 million during fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company tracks several metrics, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence, which it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company believes that housing starts will continue to improve, driven by low unemployment rates and growth in new household formation.
794619_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	However, the Company expects that while the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement during fiscal 2017 it will continue to be below historical averages.
794619_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company expects that industry-wide cabinet remodeling sales will continue to be challenged until economic trends remain consistently favorable.
794619_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Growth is expected at roughly a mid-single digit rate during the Company s fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	The Company expects that its home center market share will be relatively stable in fiscal 2017 and it will continue to gain market share in its growing dealer business.
794619_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	This combination is expected to result in remodeling sales growth that exceeds the market rate.
794619_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Based on available information, it is expected that new residential construction starts will grow approximately 10% during its fiscal year.
794619_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company s new residential construction sales growth outperformed the new residential construction market during fiscal 2016, and management expects that it will again outperform the new residential construction market during fiscal 2017 but by a lesser rate than fiscal 2016, as its comparable prior year sales levels become more challenging.
794619_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements, the Company expects that it will grow its total sales at a low-teen rate in fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Despite anticipated material inflation, costs related to two product launches and impacts in the first half of fiscal 2017 for the West Virginia plant expansion, the Company expects to maintain operating margins for fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company had gross outlays for capital expenditures and customer display units of $33.1 million during fiscal 2016, and plans to decrease its base spending level during fiscal 2017 now that has completed its facility expansion in West Virginia.

794619_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities.
794619_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Company can borrow up to $35 million under its revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), which expires on December 31, 2018.

794619_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was $71.8 million, compared with $58.7 million in fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The $13.1 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $23.2 million improvement in net income offset by an $8.9 million increase in cash used for the Company s working capital investment in customer receivables.
794619_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was $58.7 million, compared with $40.5 million in fiscal 2014.
794619_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The $18.2 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $15.0 million improvement in net income and a $5.1 million decrease in cash used for the Company's working capital investment in inventory and customer receivables.

794619_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	During fiscal 2016, the Company s decrease in net cash used for investing activities was driven by a $27.0 million decrease in investment in certificates of deposit, offset by an $8.7 million increase in outflows for capital expenditures and a $2.1 million increase in outflows for promotional displays and a $0.4 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of closed plants and property, plant and equipment compared to the prior year.
794619_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company realized a net outflow of $6.1 million from financing activities in fiscal 2016, compared with a net inflow of $11.7 million in fiscal 2015, and a net inflow of $7.8 million in fiscal 2014.

794619_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	On November 19, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional repurchase of up to $20 million of the Company's common shares.
794619_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	This authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase program authorized on November 20, 2014.
794619_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms the Company deems appropriate and subject to the Company's cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under the Company s revolving credit facility, and other factors management deems relevant.

794619_16_ITEM7_P48_S7	Although the evaluation of its future capital expenditures is ongoing, the Company expects that it will make repurchases of its common shares from time to time during fiscal 2017 subject to the Company s financial condition, capital requirements, results of operations and any other factors then deemed relevant.
794619_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	The timing of the Company s contractual obligations as of April 30, 2016 is summarized in the table below:
794619_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the Company s primary loan agreement and capitalized lease agreements.
794619_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Amounts outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility, $10 million at April 30, 2016, bear a variable interest rate determined by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.5%.
794619_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Interest under the Company s capitalized lease agreements is fixed at rates between 2% and 6.5%.
794619_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Interest commitments under interest bearing debt for the Company s revolving credit facility are at LIBOR plus the spread as of April 30, 2016, throughout the remaining term of the facility.

794619_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	For additional discussion of risks that could affect the Company and its business, see Forward-Looking Statements above, as well as Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
794619_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	As of April 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
794619_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the Company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported.
794619_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.
794619_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
794619_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
794619_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage, workers compensation liability, general liability, auto liability and property insurance.
794619_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit total exposure.
794619_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company establishes a liability at each balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate insurance liabilities are an accurate reflection of the liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans.
794619_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The estimated expense, benefits and pension obligations of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations.
794619_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Beginning with the April 30, 2016 measurement, the Company refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit cost.
794619_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve.
794619_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each benefit payment will be used.
794619_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	The Company believes this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.
794619_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	Compared to the previous method, the spot rate approach will decrease the service and interest components of the benefit costs in fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM7_P68_S5	There is no impact on the total benefit obligation.
794619_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2016 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note H of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	At April 30, 2016, the discount rate was 4.06% compared with 4.19% at April 30, 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	The expected return on plan assets was 7.5% at both April 30, 2016, and April 30, 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	The rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond April 30, 2012 because the Company froze its pension plans as of that date.
794619_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The projected performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have resulted from changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to a current market rate at each annual measurement date.
794619_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	From the fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 4.56% at April 30, 2014 to 4.19% at April 30, 2015, which caused an actuarial loss of $24.2 million.
794619_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	From the fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 measurement dates, the discount rate decreased from 4.19% to 4.06%, which caused an actuarial loss of $1.9 million.
794619_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants.
794619_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees, were (1.6)%, 6.6% and 9.4% for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
794619_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2016 was $107.0 million compared with $108.7 million at April 30, 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	The Company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by $67.1 million in fiscal 2016 and by $61.3 million in fiscal 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	The $5.8 million increase in the Company s net under-funded position during fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the Company s $1.9 million actuarial loss and asset returns that were less than expected, offset by increased Company contributions.
794619_16_ITEM7_P74_S3	The Company expects its pension expense to decrease from $0.3 million in fiscal 2016 to $(0.5) million in fiscal 2017, due primarily to the change to the new mortality tables, decrease in the discount rate and the spot rate approach.
794619_16_ITEM7_P74_S4	The Company expects to contribute $7.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2017, which represents required and discretionary funding.
794619_16_ITEM7_P74_S5	The Company made contributions of $5.0 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
794619_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards.
794619_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
794619_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	The gross amount of state tax credit carryforwards related to state ITCs as of April 30, 2016 was $5.8 million.
794619_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	These credits expire in various years beginning in fiscal 2020.
794619_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	Net of the federal impact and related valuation allowance, the Company has recorded $1.8 million of deferred tax assets related to these credits.
794619_16_ITEM7_P77_S3	The Company accounts for ITCs under the deferral method, under which the tax benefit from the ITC is deferred and amortized into income tax expense over the book life of the related property.
794619_16_ITEM7_P77_S4	As of April 30, 2016, a deferred credit balance of $1.8 million is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
794619_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606.
794619_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standard Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
794619_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The standard requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
794619_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
794619_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period.
794619_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 will have on its financial position and results of operations.
794619_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
794619_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Company retrospectively adopted this guidance on April 30, 2016.
794619_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	As a result of the retrospective adoption of this ASU, current assets decreased and noncurrent assets increased by $9.6 million as of April 30, 2015.
794619_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not impact net income or any other amounts previously reported on the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income or cash flows.
794619_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Among other things, ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet, which will increase reported assets and liabilities.
794619_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP.
794619_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
794619_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities.
794619_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
794619_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	ASU 2016-09 is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB s simplification initiative.
794619_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes.
794619_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years for public companies.
794619_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period provided that the entire ASU is adopted.
794619_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Even if an entity early adopts the amendments after the first interim period, the adoption date is as of the beginning of the year for the issues adopted by the cumulative-effect and prospective methods.
794619_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	Any adjustments to previously reported interim periods of that fiscal year should be included in the year-to-date results.
794619_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	If those previously reported interim results appear in any future filings, they are reported on the revised basis.
794619_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

794619_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standard Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
794619_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	The standard requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
794619_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
794619_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period.
794619_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 will have on its financial position and results of operations.
794619_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.

794619_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years for public companies.
794619_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period provided that the entire ASU is adopted.
794619_16_ITEM8_P34_S4	Even if an entity early adopts the amendments after the first interim period, the adoption date is as of the beginning of the year for the issues adopted by the cumulative-effect and prospective methods.
794619_16_ITEM8_P34_S5	Any adjustments to previously reported interim periods of that fiscal year should be included in the year-to-date results.

794619_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
794619_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Use of Estimates : The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period.

794619_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option granted.
794619_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	For purposes of determining the fair value of RSUs, the Company uses the closing stock price of its common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.
794619_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	The fair value of the Company s RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the RSUs to the extent the Company believes it is probable the related performance criteria, if any, will be met.
794619_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the vesting period of the RSU grant.

794619_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	The exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the option grant date.
794619_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	The following table presents a summary of the Company s stock option activity for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (remaining contractual term in years and exercise prices are weighted-averages):
794619_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on April 30, 2016.

794619_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	The PBRSUs granted in fiscal 2016 are earned based on achievement of a number of goals pertaining to the Company s operational and financial performance during the performance period of fiscal 2016.
794619_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	Employees who satisfy the vesting criteria will receive a proportional amount of PBRSUs based upon the Compensation Committee s assessment of the Company s achievement of the performance criteria.
794619_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	The following table contains a summary of the Company s RSU activity for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

794619_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	Each performance-based RSTU entitles the recipient to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock as of the payment date if applicable performance conditions are met and the recipient remains continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.
794619_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	The service-based RSTUs entitle the recipients to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock as of the payment date if they remain continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.
794619_16_ITEM8_P78_S3	The RSTUs cliff-vest three years from the grant date.
794619_16_ITEM8_P78_S4	Since the RSTUs will be settled in cash, the grant date fair value of these awards is recorded as a liability until the date of payment.
794619_16_ITEM8_P78_S5	The fair value of each cash-settled RSTU award is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and the liability is adjusted, and related expense recorded, based on the new fair value.
794619_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	expense of $0.8 million , $0.4 million and $0.1 million related to RSTUs for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

794619_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	Effective January 1, 2016 the plan name was changed to the American Woodmark Corporation Retirement Savings Plan.
794619_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Under this plan, all employees who are at least 18 years old and have been employed by the Company for at least six consecutive months are eligible to receive Company stock through a discretionary profit-sharing contribution and a 401(k) matching contribution based upon the employee's contribution to the plan.
794619_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	Discretionary profit-sharing contributions ranging from 0 - 5% , based on predetermined net income levels of the Company, may be made annually in the form of Company stock.

794619_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	Effective May 1, 2015, matching contributions are made in cash by the Company.
794619_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	The expense for 401(k) matching contributions for this plan was $6.6 million , $5.6 million and $4.1 million , in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
794619_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	These plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average earnings (for salaried employees) or benefit rate (for hourly employees).
794619_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans.
794619_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at April 30, 2016 is $77.5 million ( $47.3 million net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension benefit costs.
794619_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Company expects to recognize $1.8 million ( $1.1 million net of tax) in net actuarial losses in net periodic pension benefit costs during fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Company uses an April 30 measurement date for its benefit plans.
794619_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company s non-contributory defined benefit pension plans as of April 30:
794619_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for both pension plans was $174.1 million and $170.0 million at April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
794619_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	The components of net periodic pension benefit cost do not include service costs or prior service costs due to the plans being frozen.
794619_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	Actuarial Assumptions : The discount rate at April 30 was used to measure the year-end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year.
794619_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and earnings effects for the pension plans follow:
794619_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company bases the discount rate on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period.
794619_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	The long-term rate of return on assets is determined based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy.
794619_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	Beginning with the April 30, 2016 measurement, the Company refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit cost.
794619_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve.
794619_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each benefit payment will be used.
794619_16_ITEM8_P92_S3	The Company believes this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.
794619_16_ITEM8_P92_S4	Compared to the previous method, the spot rate approach will decrease the service and interest components of the benefit costs in fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM8_P92_S5	There is no impact on the total benefit obligation.
794619_16_ITEM8_P92_S6	The Company will account for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
794619_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions.
794619_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company amortizes experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, over the average remaining lifetime of the active participants.
794619_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	Contributions: The Company funds the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts the Company deems appropriate.
794619_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Company expects to contribute $7.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2017.
794619_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	The Company made contributions of $5.0 million and $4.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
794619_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	Estimated Future Benefit Payments : The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid:
794619_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	Plan Assets: Pension assets by major category and the type of fair value measurement as of April 30, 2016 and 2015 are presented in the following tables:
794619_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	1 The Collective Trust Funds are valued by applying each plan's ownership percentage in the fund to the fund's net assets at fair value at the valuation date.
794619_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with its pension plans.
794619_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The objectives of the investment strategies include preservation of capital and long-term growth of capital while avoiding excessive risk.
794619_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by the Company s Pension Committee.
794619_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and the Pension Committee may approve allocations above or below a target range.
794619_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	During a period of uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets, the Pension Committee may suspend the Target Asset Allocation and manage the investment mix as it sees reasonable, prudent and in the best interest of the plans to better protect the value of the plan assets.
794619_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company s pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at April 30, 2016 and 2015, by asset category, were as follows:

794619_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	The research and experimentation tax credit for fiscal year 2016 is not estimated to be significant.
794619_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	Income taxes paid were $24.5 million , $13.3 million and $4.3 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
794619_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
794619_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards.
794619_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
794619_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The gross amount of state tax credit carryforwards related to state ITCs as of April 30, 2016 was $5.8 million .
794619_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	These credits expire in various years beginning in fiscal 2020.
794619_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	Net of the federal impact and related valuation allowance, the Company has recorded $1.8 million of deferred tax assets related to these credits.
794619_16_ITEM8_P111_S3	The Company accounts for ITCs under the deferral method, under which the tax benefit from the ITC is deferred and amortized into income tax expense over the book life of the related property.
794619_16_ITEM8_P111_S4	As of April 30, 2016, a deferred credit balance of $1.8 million is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
794619_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company accounts for its income tax uncertainties in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
794619_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Company had recorded a liability relating to uncertain tax positions for the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015 of $30,000 and $0 , respectively.
794619_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	With minor exceptions, the Company is currently open to audit by tax authorities for tax years ending April 30, 2013 through April 30, 2016.
794619_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	The Company is currently not under federal audit.
794619_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims, and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_16_ITEM8_P116_S2	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible is not material as of April 30, 2016.
794619_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.
794619_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	The warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.
794619_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates.
794619_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	Warranty claims are generally made within two months of the original shipment date.
794619_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the Company s warranty liability:

794619_16_ITEM8_P121_S2	Minimum rental commitments as of April 30, 2016, under noncancelable leases with terms in excess of one year are as follows:
794619_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	During fiscal 1985, prior to becoming a publicly held corporation, the Company entered into an agreement with a partnership which includes certain former executive officers and current significant shareholders of the Company, including one current member of the Board of Directors of the Company, to lease the Company s headquarters building which was constructed and is owned by the partnership.
794619_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	The Company has subsequently renewed this lease in accordance with Company policy and procedures which includes approval by the Board of Directors.
794619_16_ITEM8_P122_S2	In considering the renewal of this lease, the Company assesses the lease terms in relation to market terms for comparable properties.
794619_16_ITEM8_P122_S3	Based upon this review, the Company believes that the rent under the lease is in line with market rates that could be obtained at arm s length from unaffiliated third parties.
794619_16_ITEM8_P122_S4	As of April 30, 2016, the Company is in the first year of the latest five -year renewal period, which expires in 2021.

794619_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated.
794619_16_ITEM8_P125_S3	Any resulting adjustments to the allowance are reflected in current operating results.
794619_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	At April 30, 2016, the Company's two largest customers, Customers A and B, represented 12.4% and 21.0% of the Company's gross customer receivables, respectively.

794619_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	American Woodmark Corporation ( American Woodmark or the Company ) manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	American Woodmark was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division.
794619_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	American Woodmark was operated privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a registered public offering of its common stock.
794619_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in 514 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles.
794619_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our cabinets are offered in a broad range of sizes, contruction and decorative options to achieve a broad range of design layouts.
794619_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	To satisfy the fashion and style needs of the market place we offer 85 door designs with a targeted range of painted and stained finishes on maple, cherry and oak as well as engineered fronts under the Duraform TM mark.
794619_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark , Simply Woodmark , Timberlake , Shenandoah Cabinetry , Shenandoah Value Series , and Waypoint Living Spaces .
794619_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	American Woodmark s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.

794619_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of seven service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.

794619_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers.
794619_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offerings, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality.
794619_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.
794619_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	General economic forces and changes in the Company s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material.
794619_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage.
794619_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio of well below 20%, and working capital net of cash of less than 6% of net sales.

794619_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
794619_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company holds patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing processes.
794619_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Company views its trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important to its business.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings Forward-Looking Statements, Seasonality, and Outlook for Fiscal 2018.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company s business is dependent upon remodeling activity and residential construction.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The Company s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity and therefore significantly impact the Company's operations.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Prolonged economic downturns may adversely impact the Company s sales, earnings and liquidity.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company s industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	During economic downturns, the Company s industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The Company believes that its industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors not only may affect the ultimate consumer of the Company s products, but also may impact home centers, builders and the Company s other primary customers.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, a worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect the Company s sales and earnings as well as its cash flow and liquidity.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Company s future financial performance depends in part on the success of its new product development and other growth strategies.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus on organic growth.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, the Company s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe s Companies, Inc. were approximately 37% of total company sales for fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although builders, dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	A significant change in the terms and conditions on which the Company does business with The Home Depot or Lowe's Companies, Inc. could also have a material adverse impact on the Company.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company continually reviews its manufacturing operations.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These reviews could result in the expansion of capacity, functions, systems, or procedures, which in turn could result in inefficiencies for a period that would decrease near-term earnings until the additional capacity is in place and fully operating.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, downturns in the economy could potentially have a larger impact on the Company as a result of this added capacity.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Impairment charges could reduce the Company s profitability.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company has significant long-lived assets, including deferred tax assets, recorded on its balance sheets.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The outcome of future reviews could result in substantial impairment charges.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company s results of operations.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to inflation and increasing costs.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary or otherwise increasing raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Despite these efforts, systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances the Company's disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to the Company's reputation, exposure to litigation and increased operational costs.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Such events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, the Company could be adversely affected if any of its significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Although the Company believes that its facilities and operations are in material compliance with such laws, ordinances and regulations, it could incur substantial costs, including legal expenses, as a result of noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, such laws, ordinances and regulations.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As the owner and lessee of real property, the Company can be held liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination on such properties, in some circumstances, without regard to whether the Company knew of or was responsible for such contamination.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	No assurance can be provided that remediation may not be required in the future as a result of spills or releases of hazardous substances, the discovery of unknown environmental conditions, more stringent standards regarding existing residual contamination, or changes in legislation, laws, rules or regulations.
794619_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	More burdensome environmental regulatory requirements may increase our general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The Company s business is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on the Company s operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

794619_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Company s success depends, in part, on its ability to recruit and retain certain key employees.

794619_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Cabinet sales, as reported by members of the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA), increased by 4% during fiscal 2017 versus the prior fiscal year, suggesting an increase in both new construction and remodeling sales of cabinets.

794619_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company experienced promotional levels during fiscal 2017 that were higher than those experienced in its prior fiscal year.
794619_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Company s remodeling sales were flat during fiscal 2017, below the overall remodeling market.

794619_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Management believes the Company over indexed the market due to share penetration with our builder partners and the health of the markets where we concentrated our business during fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2017 was 21.8%, an improvement from 21.1% in fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in the Company s gross margin rate was driven by the beneficial impact of increased sales volume, lower labor benefit costs and improved operating efficiency.
794619_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company has been profitable for the last 5 years.
794619_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	As of April 30, 2017, the Company had total deferred tax assets of $27.5 million, down from $41.3 million at April 30, 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Company's deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to Company contributions to the pension plans as well as better than expected returns from the plans assets.
794619_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	in fiscal 2016 due to an increase in the unfunded pension obligation, as a result of a decrease in the discount rate and the Company updating to the new RP-2014 mortality tables, with generational MP-2015 projections.
794619_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	To fully realize its remaining net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to, among other things, substantially reduce its unfunded pension obligation of $28.0 million at April 30, 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards during fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	In fiscal 2017, the Company reassessed the valuation allowance related to ITCs and released $0.6 million of the valuation allowance recorded in the fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company expects to continue funding its pension plans for the foreseeable future, which will reduce both its unfunded pension plan obligation and its deferred tax asset.
794619_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The recent improvement in the U.S. housing market and the Company s continued ability to grow its sales at a faster rate than its competitors, enabled the Company to generate net income during fiscal 2017 like it has done since fiscal 2013.
794619_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Company believes that the positive evidence of the housing industry improvement, coupled with the benefits from the Company s successful restructuring and continued market share gains have already driven a return to profitability that is expected to continue.
794619_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	Accordingly, Management has concluded it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets.
794619_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company also regularly assesses its long-lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred.
794619_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company has concluded that none of the long-lived assets pertaining to its nine manufacturing plants or any of its other long-lived assets were impaired as of April 30, 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net sales were $1,030.2 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of $83.2 million, or 9%, compared with fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2017 was 8.0% higher than in fiscal 2016, which was driven primarily by the Company s increased new construction and dealer volume.
794619_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 0.8% in fiscal 2017, driven by improvements in the Company s product mix and pricing.

794619_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 3% in fiscal 2016, driven by improvements in the Company s product mix and pricing.
794619_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 21.8% in fiscal 2017 as compared with 21.1% in fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of increased sales volume, lower labor benefit costs and improved operating efficiency.
794619_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	During fiscal 2016, the Company s gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to 21.1% from 18.5% in fiscal 2015.
794619_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of increased sales volume, customer management, product mix, pricing and improved operating efficiency.
794619_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	This favorability was partially offset by the impact of additional depreciation costs related to the previously announced plant expansion and costs associated with crewing and infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and installation activity.
794619_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2017 were 6.9% of net sales, compared with 7.0% of net sales in fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Selling and marketing costs increased only by 7% despite a 9% increase in net sales.
794619_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	The improvement in the percentage of sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to favorable leverage from increased sales, on-going expense control and lower display costs and commissions.
794619_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were 7.0% of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with 7.8% in fiscal 2015.
794619_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	The improvement in the percentage of sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to favorable leverage from increased sales, on-going expense control and lower display and product launch costs.
794619_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	General and administrative expenses increased by $5.4 million or 13.4% during fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase was related to increased staffing costs and the incurrence of corporate business development expenses related to a potential M A transaction that we ultimately decided not to pursue.
794619_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	General and administrative costs increased to 4.4% of net sales in fiscal 2017 compared with 4.3% of net sales in fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 increased by $6.3 million, or 18.6%, compared with fiscal 2015 and represented 4.3% of net sales, compared with 4.1% of net sales for fiscal 2015.
794619_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in cost was related to increased pay-for-performance compensation and staffing costs.
794619_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company generated pre-tax income of $108.9 million during fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Company s effective tax rate decreased from 36.0% in fiscal 2016 to 34.6% in fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from adopting ASU 2016-09 for equity based compensation.
794619_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	The Company s effective tax rate increased from 34.7% in fiscal 2015 to 36.0% in fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	The higher effective tax rate was the result of the Company operating at a higher net income level than the prior year period and less favorable permanent tax differences.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company tracks several metrics, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence, which it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Company believes that housing starts will continue to improve, driven by low unemployment rates and growth in new household formation.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	However, the Company expects that while the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement during fiscal 2018 it will continue to be below historical averages.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company expects that industry-wide cabinet remodeling sales will continue to be challenged until economic trends remain consistently favorable.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	Growth is expected at roughly a mid-single digit rate during the Company s fiscal 2018.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	The Company expects its home center market share to remain at normalized levels for fiscal 2018, however this is heavily dependent upon competitive promotional activity, and it will continue to gain market share in its growing dealer business.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	This combination is expected to result in remodeling sales growth that exceeds the market rate.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S7	Based on available information, it is expected that new residential construction starts will grow approximately 8 to 10% during fiscal 2018.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S8	The Company s new residential construction sales growth outperformed the new residential construction market during fiscal 2017, and management expects that it will again outperform the new residential construction market during fiscal 2018 but by a lesser rate than during fiscal 2017, as its comparable prior year sales levels become more challenging to exceed.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S9	Inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements, the Company expects that it will grow its total sales at a high-single digit rate in fiscal 2018.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S10	Despite anticipated material inflation and freight and transportation rate increases, the Company expects to improve gross margins and operating margins for fiscal 2018.
794619_17_ITEM7_P29_S11	The Company had gross outlays for capital expenditures and customer display units of $25.5 million during fiscal 2017, and plans to increase its base spending level during fiscal 2018 now that it has started construction on its new corporate headquarters in Winchester, Virginia.

794619_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The $2.5 million improvement was primarily attributable to the Company s $12.5 million improvement in net income and an increase in accrued expenses, which was partially offset by an $23.1 million increase in cash used for excess pension contributions.
794619_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was $74.6 million, compared with $60.2 million in fiscal 2015.

794619_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
794619_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
794619_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage, workers compensation liability, general liability, auto liability and property insurance.

794619_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company establishes a liability at each balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate insurance liabilities are an accurate reflection of the liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans.
794619_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The estimated expense, benefits and pension obligations of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations.
794619_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Beginning with the April 30, 2016 measurement, the Company refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit cost.
794619_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve.
794619_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each benefit payment will be used.
794619_17_ITEM7_P62_S3	The Company believes this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.
794619_17_ITEM7_P62_S4	Compared to the previous method, the spot rate approach decreased the service and interest components of the benefit costs in fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P62_S5	There is no impact on the total benefit obligation.
794619_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical 1% change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and consumer price index:
794619_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2017 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note H of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	At April 30, 2017, the weighted average discount rate was 4.12% compared with 4.06% at April 30, 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	The expected return on plan assets was 7.5% at both April 30, 2017, and April 30, 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	The rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond April 30, 2012 because the Company froze its pension plans as of that date.
794619_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	The projected performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have resulted from changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to a current market rate at each annual measurement date.
794619_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants.
794619_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees, were 10.3%, (1.6)% and 6.6% for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
794619_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2017 was $137.1 million compared with $107.0 million at April 30, 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	The Company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by $28.0 million in fiscal 2017 and by $67.1 million in fiscal 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	The $39.1 million decrease in the Company s net under-funded position during fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by the Company s $27.3 million contributions and actuarial gains and asset returns that were more than expected.
794619_17_ITEM7_P69_S3	The Company expects its pension expense to decrease from $(0.5) million in fiscal 2017 to $(1.6) million in fiscal 2018, due primarily to the improvement in the funded status of the plans, partially offset by a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return from 7.5% to 6.5%.
794619_17_ITEM7_P69_S4	The Company expects to contribute $5.7 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018, which represents required and discretionary funding.
794619_17_ITEM7_P69_S5	The Company made contributions of $27.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
794619_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards.
794619_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

794619_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standard Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance.
794619_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The standard requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
794619_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
794619_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 to have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
794619_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of ASU 2014-09 primarily to determine the transition method to utilize at adoption and the additional disclosures required.
794619_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet, which will increase reported assets and liabilities.

794619_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
794619_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities.
794619_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements, however, if at adoption the Company has similar obligations for leases as it had at April 30, 2017, the Company believes this guidance will not have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
794619_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shares-Based Payment Accounting.

794619_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	ASU 2016-09 changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes.
794619_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years for public companies.
794619_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	The Company early adopted this standard as of May 1, 2016.
794619_17_ITEM7_P81_S5	As a result, during fiscal 2017, it recognized the excess tax benefit of $1.3 million as income tax benefit on the condensed consolidated statements of income (adopted prospectively).
794619_17_ITEM7_P81_S6	The adoption did not impact the existing classification of the awards.
794619_17_ITEM7_P81_S7	Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation is now classified in net income in the statement of cash flows instead of being separately stated in financing activities for the twelve months ended April 30, 2017 (adopted prospectively).

794619_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	Adoption of the new guidance did not impact the Company's shareholder's equity, results of operations or statements of cash flows.
794619_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent), which amends the disclosure requirements of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for reporting entities that measure the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.
794619_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The amendments in ASU 2015-07 remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and also remove the requirements to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient.
794619_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	The Company retrospectively adopted this standard on April 30, 2017, which impacted the disclosure of investments, see Note H for additional information.
794619_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	ASU 2017-07 requires an employer to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit (income) cost.
794619_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	The other components of net benefit (income) cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside of operating income.
794619_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	The amendments also allow only the service cost component of net benefit (income) cost to be eligible for capitalization.
794619_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
794619_17_ITEM7_P84_S4	The amendments in this ASU should be applied (1) retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension (income) cost and net periodic postretirement benefit (income) cost on the income statement, and (2) prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension (income) cost and net periodic postretirement benefit (income) cost in assets.

794619_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	Each performance-based RSTU entitles the recipient to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock as of the payment date if applicable performance and cultural conditions are met and the recipient remains continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.
794619_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	The service-based RSTUs entitle the recipients to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock as of the payment date if they remain continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.
794619_17_ITEM8_P83_S3	The RSTUs cliff-vest three years from the grant date.
794619_17_ITEM8_P83_S4	Since the RSTUs will be settled in cash, the grant date fair value of these awards is recorded as a liability until the date of payment.

794619_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company s non-contributory defined benefit pension plans as of April 30:
794619_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for both pension plans was $165.2 million and $174.1 million at April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
794619_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	The components of net periodic pension benefit cost do not include service costs or prior service costs due to the plans being frozen.
794619_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	Actuarial Assumptions : The discount rate at April 30 was used to measure the year-end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year.
794619_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and earnings effects for the pension plans follow:
794619_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company bases the discount rate on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period.
794619_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	The long-term rate of return on assets is determined based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy.
794619_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	Beginning with the April 30, 2016 measurement, the Company refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit cost.
794619_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve.
794619_17_ITEM8_P95_S2	Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each benefit payment will be used.
794619_17_ITEM8_P95_S3	The Company believes this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.
794619_17_ITEM8_P95_S4	Compared to the previous method, the spot rate approach decreased the service and interest components of the benefit costs in fiscal 2017.
794619_17_ITEM8_P95_S5	There was no impact on the total benefit obligation.
794619_17_ITEM8_P95_S6	The Company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
794619_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions.
794619_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company amortizes experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, over the average remaining lifetime of the active participants.
794619_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	Contributions: The Company funds the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts the Company deems appropriate.
794619_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Company expects to contribute $5.7 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018.
794619_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Company made contributions of $27.3 million and $5.0 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
794619_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	Estimated Future Benefit Payments : The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid:
794619_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	Plan Assets: Pension assets by major category and the type of fair value measurement as of April 30, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following tables:
794619_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	1 As discussed in Note A, investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have been removed from the total plan assets in the fair value hierarchy.

794619_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	During a period of uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets, the Pension Committee may suspend the Target Asset Allocation and manage the investment mix as it sees reasonable, prudent and in the best interest of the plans to better protect the value of the plan assets.

794619_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	Due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal year 2017, excess tax benefits of stock compensation were recorded in tax expense while in previous years excess benefits were recorded in additional paid-in-capital and therefore, did not impact the effective tax rate.
794619_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	Income taxes paid were $27.3 million , $24.5 million and $13.3 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

794619_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards.
794619_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

794619_17_ITEM8_P115_S3	The Company accounts for ITCs under the deferral method, under which the tax benefit from the ITC is deferred and amortized into income tax expense over the book life of the related property.
794619_17_ITEM8_P115_S4	As of April 30, 2017 and 2016, a deferred credit balance of $1.5 million and $1.8 million , respectively, is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.

794619_17_ITEM8_P118_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_17_ITEM8_P120_S2	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consultation with independent counsel.
794619_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible is not material as of April 30, 2017.

794619_17_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Company has subsequently renewed this lease in accordance with Company policy and procedures which includes approval by the Board of Directors.

794619_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our core business offers framed stock cabinets in over 420 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles.
794619_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	These cabinets are offered in a broad range of sizes, construction and decorative options to achieve a broad range of design layouts.
794619_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	To satisfy the fashion and style needs of the market place we offer over 90 door designs with a targeted range of painted and stained finishes on maple, cherry and oak as well as engineered fronts under the Duraform mark.
794619_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	These products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark , Simply Woodmark , Timberlake , Shenandoah Cabinetry , Shenandoah Value Series and Waypoint Living Spaces .
794619_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	On December 29, 2017, we completed the acquisition of RSI, a leading manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinetry and home organization products, for consideration consisting of 1,457,568 newly issued shares of American Woodmark common stock, approximately $364 million in net cash, and the assumption of approximately $589 million of RSI debt, including accrued interest.
794619_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	We refer to this acquisition as the RSI Acquisition.
794619_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Founded in 1989 by Ron Simon with a vision of creating value for customers by providing high quality products at affordable prices not otherwise widely available in the industry, RSI had grown to one of the largest in-stock and value-based cabinet makers in North America providing kitchen, bathroom, home and garage organization cabinetry, counter tops and accessories with over 100 styles and finishes to home centers, builders, dealers and remodeling contractors.
794619_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	RSI sells products under the brand names of American Classics by RSI , Estate by RSI , Continental Cabinets , Insignia by RSI , Architectural Bath , MasterBath by RSI , VillaBath by RSI , Designer Series and RSI Professional Cabinet Solutions .
794619_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	RSI also sells products under key customer s private label brands, such as Hampton Bay, Glacier Bay, Blue Hawk, Style Selections, Home Decorators Collection and Project Source.
794619_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	We offer a wide variety of products that fall into product lines including kitchen cabinetry, bath cabinetry, office cabinetry, home organization and hardware.
794619_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our cabinetry products are available in a variety of designs, finishes and finish colors and door styles.
794619_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	We offer products in the following categories: in-stock and stock.
794619_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	In-stock products represent cash and carry products sold through home centers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	Stock products utilize higher grade materials with more options as compared to in-stock and are all special ordered and shipped directly to the home from the factory.
794619_18_ITEM1_P9_S3	Our home organization products are exclusively in-stock products.
794619_18_ITEM1_P9_S4	Our kitchen cabinetry and bath cabinetry are offered across all both product categories (in-stock and stock) and our office cabinetry is offered in stock.
794619_18_ITEM1_P9_S5	Our in-stock products are sold through home centers, while our stock products are sold through home centers, builders and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets.
794619_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	We service these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	We distribute our products to each market channel directly from our assembly plants through a third party logistics network.
794619_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	We serve three main categories of customers: home center customers, builders and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Contractors, builders, remodelers and do it yourself homeowners use our products primarily for repair and remodel ( R R ) projects.
794619_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	Products for R R projects are predominately purchased through home centers such as Home Depot and Lowe s. Due to the market presence, store network and customer reach of these large home centers, our strategy has been to develop long-term strategic relationships with both Home Depot and Lowe s to distribute our products.
794619_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018 ( fiscal 2018 ), Home Depot and Lowe s accounted for approximately 41.8% of gross sales of the Company.
794619_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	The loss of either Home Depot or Lowe s as a customer would have a material adverse effect on us.
794619_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Builder business represents a large portion of our overall revenue and has historically been a strategic component of our go-to-market strategy.
794619_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	We serve the majority of the top U.S. builders with a high degree of geographic concentration around major metro areas where single family starts are most robust.
794619_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our various service center locations serve the function of being close to this business and enable us to deliver exceptional service to our builder partners.
794619_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	In 2010, we expanded our business into the dealer channel with the launch of the Waypoint Living Spaces brand.
794619_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Today, we sell this brand to over 1,200 regional and local dealers across the country.
794619_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	The dealer channel of the market is the largest by volume, characterized by a high degree of entrepreneurship and one that rewards suppliers that deliver great service.
794619_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our ability to provide superior value delivered with exceptional service has helped drive our expansion into this channel and will continue to be a strong growth and market share opportunity for us.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are strategically located to serve our customers, which enhances our ability to provide high quality, value priced products with low production costs.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	We manufacture our products across 18 facilities located in Maryland, Indiana, West Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky, Virginia, California, Texas, North Carolina and Tijuana, Mexico.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	The geographic distribution of our facilities throughout the United States, together with our third party logistics network for the American Woodmark business and beneficial freight arrangement with home centers for the RSI business, enable us to provide a short supply chain to our U.S. customers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	The ordering patterns of Home Depot and Lowe s, our two biggest customers, require suppliers to have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand and to serve a large number (frequently hundreds to thousands) of stores.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	They impose strict logistics and performance obligations on us.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S5	As enhanced with the RSI Acquisition, the scale and strategic locations of our manufacturing facilities help us to meet these demands of the home center customers, as well as provide a logistics platform that we can leverage for builders and dealers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S6	We distribute our products through distribution centers located in our manufacturing facilities to maximize efficiency.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S7	Our vertically-integrated production and assembly lines, standardized product construction and investments in automation have allowed us to continuously improve productivity and develop an expertise in wood processing and yield-maximizing technologies.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S8	We have standardized our raw material inputs and a number of our production processes, which reduces logistical requirements to manufacture and gives us increased economies of scale in sourcing these inputs.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S9	Certain of our inputs are also partially processed by our vendors, which reduces cost.
794619_18_ITEM1_P15_S10	In addition, RSI s production of labor-intensive manufacturing and fabrication processes in its three Tijuana, Mexico facilities have enabled it to keep overall labor costs low while maintaining higher quality, greater speed-to-market and transportation cost advantage over Asian manufacturers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	We provide complete turnkey installation services to our direct builder customers via our network of seven primary service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States in Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Arizona and California.
794619_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	We regularly evaluate our organizational productivity and supply chains and assess opportunities to reduce costs and enhance quality.
794619_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	We strive to improve quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions, as well as manage cost inflation, including wages and employee medical costs.
794619_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	The primary raw materials used in our products include hard maple, soft maple, oak, and cherry lumber and plywood.
794619_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, medium density fiberboard, high density fiberboard, manufactured components and hardware.
794619_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	We purchase these and other raw materials from more than one source and believe them to be readily available.
794619_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	We rely on outside suppliers for some of our key components and do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or sourcing partners.
794619_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	We source a portion of our components from third parties in Asia.
794619_18_ITEM1_P18_S5	The distances involved in these arrangements, together with the differences in business practices, shipping and delivery requirements, and laws and regulations add complexity to our supply chain logistics and increase the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling.
794619_18_ITEM1_P18_S6	In addition, prices and availability of these components may be affected by world market conditions and government policies.
794619_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	We operate in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional and national manufacturers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Most of our competitors compete on a local or regional basis, but others, like us, compete on a national basis as well.
794619_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our competitors include large consolidated operations as well as relatively small, local cabinet manufacturers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	Moreover, companies in other building products industries may compete with us.
794619_18_ITEM1_P19_S4	Competitive factors within the industry include pricing, quality, product availability, service, delivery time and relationships with customers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P19_S5	Our principal means for competition is our breadth and variety of product offerings, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach, competitive price points for our products and affordable quality.
794619_18_ITEM1_P19_S6	We are the second largest manufacturer of kitchen, bath and home organization products in the United States.
794619_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of regulated materials into the environment.
794619_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Permits are required for certain of our operations, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.
794619_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines or the entry of injunctions, or both.
794619_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	We may also incur liability for investigation and clean-up of soil or groundwater contamination on or emanating from current or formerly owned and operated properties, or at offsite locations at which regulated materials are located where we are identified as a responsible party.
794619_18_ITEM1_P20_S4	Discovery of currently unknown conditions could require responses that could result in significant costs.
794619_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	We maintain trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets.
794619_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	We sell many of our products under a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in our industry.
794619_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	We rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position.
794619_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
794619_18_ITEM1_P21_S4	The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position.
794619_18_ITEM1_P21_S5	If we must litigate to protect our rights, we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations.
794619_18_ITEM1_P21_S6	To date, we have not relied on patents in operating our business.
794619_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our core business has been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in our second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	General economic forces and changes in our customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	RSI s historic net sales vary from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of Home Depot and Lowe s customer promotions, product roll-outs and their inventory management.
794619_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	However, RSI historically did not have significant recurring seasonality impacts on its business.
794619_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	As of April 30, 2018, we employed approximately 9,400 full-time employees, and approximately 230 of the RSI employees in Anaheim, California were unionized.
794619_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	We believe that our employee relations and relationship with the union representing the RSI employees in Anaheim are good.
794619_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe our combined company holds the number two market position in the United States cabinet market with an estimated 10% market share.
794619_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	We are one of a select number of market participants with a national manufacturing and distribution footprint, including 18 manufacturing facilities and seven primary service centers across the United States and Mexico.
794619_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our operating footprint provides us an ability to service our builder, dealer and home center customers on a national basis, and with the RSI Acquisition, we offer a broader set of products to serve our customers across a variety of price points.
794619_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our facilities are primarily located in or near major metropolitan markets to facilitate efficient product distribution to our customers.
794619_18_ITEM1_P24_S4	We believe the scale and breadth of our operations differentiate us and result in a competitive advantage providing superior customer service, low-cost distribution and on-time delivery.
794619_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that the diversity of our product portfolio across categories, channels and end markets benefits our financial performance, both in periods of growth and cyclicality.
794619_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our stock offerings provide products for customers looking for a designer product, which can be used for both new home construction and remodeling applications.
794619_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	The addition of the in-stock offering with our RSI Acquisition allows us to further serve our existing end markets through the addition of a lower price point product that is well-suited for areas of growing demand such as new home construction targeting the first-time homebuyer.
794619_18_ITEM1_P25_S3	We also offer turnkey cabinet solutions for our builder customers which we believe is a unique aspect of our service platform.
794619_18_ITEM1_P25_S4	Our turnkey solution provides in-house design and measurement as well as installation service.
794619_18_ITEM1_P25_S5	We believe the ability to leverage our labor and expertise is a value-added service to our builder customers which has helped strengthen our position in the new home construction market.
794619_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have built strong and stable relationships with a base of long-standing, customers across home centers, builders and independent dealers and distributors.
794619_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have an average relationship length of 20 years with our top 10 customers, including long-standing relationships with Home Depot and Lowe s.
794619_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	We believe our customers value our national manufacturing and distribution footprint, which allows us to meet demanding logistics and performance obligations.
794619_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	We believe our focus on providing exceptional customer service and a quality product at a competitive price have enabled us to establish ourselves as a vendor of choice.
794619_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	We operate 18 manufacturing facilities across the United States and Mexico.
794619_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our vertically-integrated production and assembly lines, standardized product construction and investments in automation, have allowed us to continuously improve productivity and efficiency.
794619_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	We have standardized our raw material inputs and a number of our production processes, which reduces logistical requirements and provides increased economies of scale in sourcing these inputs.
794619_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	The RSI Acquisition increases our manufacturing capacity to support additional growth.
794619_18_ITEM1_P27_S4	In addition, RSI s production of labor-intensive manufacturing and fabrication processes in Mexico offer a low cost alternative to Asian manufacturers, while providing a higher quality product with lower transportation costs.
794619_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	We have assembled an executive team from leading organizations with a deep base of management experience within industrial manufacturing companies.
794619_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Cary Dunston, joined our team in 2006 and was named Chief Executive Officer in 2015 and elected Chairman in 2017.
794619_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Mr. Dunston has a broad range of experience in manufacturing and supply chain management including the implementation of continuous improvement programs and lean manufacturing initiatives.
794619_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	Our team has identified and begun to execute on opportunities for operational improvement that has yielded increased profitability.
794619_18_ITEM1_P28_S4	These initiatives are focused on manufacturing productivity, strategic sourcing and new product development.
794619_18_ITEM1_P28_S5	The addition of RSI s talented employee base will further add to the experience and expertise of the combined company s management team.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	also may adversely impact the Company s business.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These risks and uncertainties, which the Company considers to be most relevant to specific business activities, include, but are not limited to, the following.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in Item 7.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Because of the concentration of our sales to our two largest customers, the loss of either customer or a significant reduction in orders from either customer could adversely affect our financial results.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Home Depot and Lowe s collectively accounted for approximately 41.8% of total gross sales during the fiscal year 2018 and with the RSI Acquisition, we expect this concentration to significantly increase.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts with Home Depot or Lowe s and our sales usually occur on a purchase order basis.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our customers can make significant changes in their purchase volumes and can seek to significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services and the other terms and conditions on which we do business.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	They have discontinued, and may in the future choose to discontinue, purchasing some or all of our products with little or no notice.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In the past, purchase volumes from our customers, including Home Depot and Lowe s, have fluctuated substantially, and we expect such fluctuations to occur from time to time in the future.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Any reduction in, or termination of, our sales to either Home Depot or Lowe s could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In addition, the potential for orders from these large retail customers to increase significantly from time to time requires us to have sufficient manufacturing capacity.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These large retailers also impose strict logistics and performance obligations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Failure to comply with these obligations may result in these customers reducing or stopping their purchase of our products.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We could also experience delays or defaults in payment from Home Depot or Lowe s, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The loss of a substantial portion of our order volumes or revenue from either Home Depot or Lowe s for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business primarily relies on U.S. home improvement, repair and remodel and new home construction activity levels, all of which are impacted by risks associated with fluctuations in the housing market.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Downward changes in the general economy, the housing market or other business conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business primarily relies on home improvement, repair and remodel and new home construction activity levels in the United States.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The housing market is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, access to labor, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in any of the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and could adversely impact our businesses by: causing consumers to delay or decrease homeownership; making consumers more price conscious resulting in a shift in demand to smaller, less expensive homes; making consumers more reluctant to make investments in their existing homes, including large kitchen and bath repair and remodel projects; or making it more difficult to secure loans for major renovations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Although the U.S. new home construction market is improving, demand for new homes is still recovering after the 2007-2009 U.S. economic recession and continues to remain below historical levels.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Prolonged economic downturns may adversely impact our sales, earnings and liquidity.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	During economic downturns, our industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We believe that our industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These factors may affect not only the ultimate consumer of our products, but also may impact home centers, builders and our other primary customers.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	As a result, a worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our sales and earnings as well as our cash flow and liquidity.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The U.S. cabinetry industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We operate within the highly competitive U.S. cabinetry industry, which is characterized by competition from a number of other manufacturers.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Competition is further intensified during economic downturns.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We compete with numerous large national and regional home products companies for, among other things, customers, orders from Home Depot and Lowe s, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Purchase volumes from our main home center customers have fluctuated substantially from time to time in the past, and we expect such fluctuations to occur from time to time in the future.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do and, therefore, may be able to adapt to changes in customer preferences more quickly, devote more resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In addition, some of our competitors may resort to price competition to sustain or gain market share and manufacturing capacity utilization, and we may have to adjust the prices on some of our products to stay competitive, which could reduce our revenues.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We may not ultimately succeed in competing with other manufacturers and distributors in our market, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our failure to develop new products or respond to changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The U.S. cabinetry industry is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling new products, could lead to, among other things, rejection of a new product line, reduced demand and price reductions for our products.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If our products do not keep up with consumer trends, demands and preference, we could lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Changes to consumer shopping habits and potential trends toward online purchases could also impact our ability to compete.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Further, the volatile and challenging economic environment of recent years has caused shifts in consumer trends, demands, preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our customers.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Shifts in consumer preferences, which may or may not be long-term, have altered the quantity, type and prices of products demanded by the end-consumer and our customers.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices, our relationships with our customers could be harmed, the demand for our products could be reduced and our market share could be negatively affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our growth strategy within the dealer and homebuilder channels.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Part of our growth strategy depends on expanding our business in the dealer and homebuilder channels.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may fail to compete successfully against other companies that are already established providers within the dealer and homebuilder channels.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Demand for our products within the homebuilder and dealer channels may not grow, or might even decline.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, we may not accurately gauge consumer preferences and successfully develop, manufacture and market our products at a national level.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Further, the implementation of our growth strategy may place additional demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources and may divert management s attention away from our existing business and increase the demands on our financial systems and controls.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If our management is unable to effectively manage growth, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If our growth strategy is not successful then our revenue and earnings may not grow as anticipated or may decline, we may not be profitable, or our reputation and brand may be damaged.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	In addition, we may change our financial strategy or other components of our overall business strategy if we believe our current strategy is not effective, if our business or markets change, or for other reasons, which may cause fluctuations in our financial results.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Manufacturing expansion to add capacity, manufacturing realignments, and other cost savings programs could result in a decrease in our near-term earnings.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We continually review our manufacturing operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These reviews could result in the expansion of capacity, manufacturing realignments and various cost savings programs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Effects of manufacturing expansion, realignments or cost savings programs could result in a decrease in our short-term earnings until the additional capacity is in place, cost reductions are achieved and/or production volumes stabilize.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Such manufacturing expansions, realignments and programs involve substantial planning, often require capital investments, and may result in charges for fixed asset impairments or obsolescence and substantial severance costs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We also cannot assure you that we will achieve all of the intended cost savings.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our ability to achieve cost savings and other benefits within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P19_S8	In addition, downturns in the economy could potentially have a larger impact on the Company as a result of this added capacity.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We have recorded significant goodwill as a result of the RSI Acquisition, and goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Fluctuating raw material and energy costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We purchase various raw materials, including, among others, wood, wood-based and resin products, which are subject to price fluctuations that could materially increase our manufacturing costs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	costs and also the cost to transport our products, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, some of our suppliers have consolidated and other suppliers may do so in the future.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Combined with increased demand, such consolidation could increase the price of our supplies and raw materials.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We also may be unwilling or unable to pass on to customers commensurate cost increases.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	To the extent we are unable to either re-engineer or otherwise offset increased costs or are unwilling or unable to build price increases into our sales prices, our margins will be negatively affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Even if we are able to increase our selling prices, sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of market share, particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Conversely, when raw materials or energy prices decline, we may receive customer pressure to reduce our sales prices.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	These prices are market-based and fluctuate based on factors beyond our control.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We do not have long-term fixed supply agreements and do not hedge against price fluctuations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We, therefore, cannot predict our raw materials costs for the coming year.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The inability to obtain raw materials from suppliers in a timely manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of components from manufacturers and other suppliers, particularly wood-based and resin products.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Failure by our suppliers to provide us with quality products on commercially reasonable terms, and to comply with legal requirements for business practices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Furthermore, we rely heavily or, in certain cases, exclusively, on outside suppliers for some of our key components.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	While we do not rely exclusively on any one supplier for any particular raw materials, the loss of a major supplier could increase our costs to obtain raw materials until we obtain an adequate alternative source.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We typically do not enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or sourcing partners.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Instead, most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a purchase order basis.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Although these components are generally obtainable in sufficient quantities from other sources, resourcing them from another supplier could take time.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Financial, operating, or other difficulties encountered by our suppliers or sourcing partners or changes in our relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies, and prevent us from manufacturing enough products to meet customer demands.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We rely on a number of information technology systems to process, transmit, store and manage information to support our business activities.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We have established security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Despite these efforts, systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to litigation and increased operational costs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Increased compliance costs or liabilities associated with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and permits, including those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of waste, remediation of contaminated sites and protection of worker health and safety.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We may not be in complete compliance with these laws, regulations or permits at all times.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our efforts to comply with environmental requirements do not remove the risk that we may incur material liabilities, fines or penalties for, among other things, releases of regulated materials occurring on or emanating from current or formerly owned or operated properties or any associated offsite disposal location, or for contamination discovered at any of our properties from activities conducted by previous occupants.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Liability for environmental contamination or a release of hazardous materials may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination or other liabilities relating to our properties and operations could result in significant environmental liabilities that could impact our business, financial condition or results of operation.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, we may incur capital and other costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and enforcement policies.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These laws, including, for example, the regulations relating to formaldehyde emissions promulgated by the California Air Resources Board, require us to rely on compliance by our suppliers of raw materials.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Should a supplier fail to comply with such regulations, notify us of non-compliance, or provide us with a product that does not comply, we could be subject to disruption in our business and incur substantial liabilities.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information provided to us by customers, employees or third parties could harm our business.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We rely on the internet and other electronic methods to transmit confidential information and store confidential information on our networks.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If there were a disclosure of confidential information provided by, or concerning, our employees, customers or other third parties, including through inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, or unauthorized access, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and regulatory actions.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Changes in government and industry regulatory standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Government regulations pertaining to health and safety and environmental concerns continue to emerge, domestically as well as internationally.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	These regulations include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other worker safety regulations for the protection of employees, as well as regulations for the protection of consumers.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	It is necessary for us to comply with current requirements (including requirements that do not become effective until a future date), and even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our products or processes.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Compliance with these regulations may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Such actions could increase our capital expenditures and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations, and our inability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The loss of certain members of our management may have an adverse effect on our operating results.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our senior management and other key employees.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	These individuals possess sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, financial and administrative skills and know-how that are critical to the operation of our business.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our senior officers or other key employees, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Moreover, the pool of qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management or other key employees, should the need arise.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The loss of the services of any key personnel, or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills, could impair our ability to develop new products or enhance existing products, sell products to our customers or manage our business effectively.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We could continue to pursue growth opportunities through either acquisitions, mergers or internally developed projects, which may be unsuccessful or may adversely affect future financial condition and operating results.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We could continue to pursue opportunities for growth through either acquisitions, mergers or internally developed projects as part of our growth strategy.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating an acquired business or that an internally developed project will perform at the levels we anticipate.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We may pay for future acquisitions using cash, stock, the assumption of debt, or a combination of these.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In addition, we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks associated with a given acquisition that could adversely affect our future financial condition and operating results or result in us paying more for the acquired business or assets than they are worth.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our ability to operate and our growth potential could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot employ, train and retain qualified personnel at a competitive cost.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Many of the products that we manufacture and assemble require manual processes in plant environments.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, employ, train and retain qualified personnel with the ability to design, manufacture and assemble these products.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force as the housing market continues to recover in the United States.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our qualified labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, we believe that our success depends in part on our ability to quickly and effectively train additional workforce to handle the increased volume and production while minimizing labor inefficiencies and maintaining product quality in a housing market recovery.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	If either of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease, and any growth potential could be impaired.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We manufacture our products internationally and are exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We manufacture our products in the United States and Mexico and sell our products in the United States and Canada.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with potential disruption caused by changes in political, monetary, economic and social environments, including civil and political unrest, terrorism, possible expropriation, local labor conditions, changes in laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments and trade disputes with the United States, and compliance with U.S. laws affecting activities of U.S. companies abroad, including tax laws, economic sanctions and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	While we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents, our existing safeguards and policies to assure compliance and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If employees violate our policies, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, debarment from export privileges and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may hedge certain foreign currency transactions in the future; however, a change in the value of the currencies may impact our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, fluctuations in currency can adversely impact the cost position in local currency of our products, making it more difficult for us to compete.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our business through the impact of these potential changes.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition, we source raw materials and components from Asia where we have recently experienced higher manufacturing costs and longer lead times due to currency fluctuations, higher wage rates, labor shortages and higher raw material costs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our international sourcing of materials could be harmed by a variety of factors including:
794619_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	political unrest, terrorism and economic instability.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If any of these or other factors were to render the conduct of our business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our failure to maintain acceptable quality standards could result in significant unexpected costs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Any failure to maintain acceptable quality standards could require us to recall or redesign such products, or pay substantial damages, any of which would result in significant unexpected costs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We may also have difficulty controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, so we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Further, any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could decrease our credibility, harm our reputations, adversely affect our sales, or increase our costs.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Defects in our products could also result in decreased orders or sales to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	New U.S. tax legislation could adversely affect us.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (H.R. 1) (the "Tax Act") into law.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The Tax Act is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The Tax Act includes significant amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the Code ), including amendments that lower the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and impact the taxation of offshore earnings and the deductibility of interest.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Some of the amendments could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Comprehensive tax legislation enacted through the Tax Act significantly modified U.S. corporate income tax law.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Provisional amounts have been recorded in our financial statements based on the Company s initial analysis of the Tax Act.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The Company may adjust these amounts in future periods if our interpretation of the Tax Act changes or as additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury becomes available.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Future tax law changes or the interpretation of existing tax laws may materially impact our effective income tax rate and the resolution of unrecognized tax benefits.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our businesses are subject to taxation in the United States as well as internationally.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material adverse impact on our worldwide income tax provision.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Tax authorities in many jurisdictions routinely audit us.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Because there are significant uncertainties in the outcome of such audits, the ultimate outcome from any audit could be materially different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Future settlements of income tax audits may have a material adverse effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in our financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Many of our facilities are located in regions that are vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, tropical storms and snow and ice, which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Our redundant, multiple site capacity may not be sufficient in the event of a natural disaster, terrorist act or other catastrophic event.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Such disruptions could, among other things, disrupt our manufacturing or distribution facilities and result in delays or cancellations of customer orders for our products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Further, if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue, end-user customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products, which may materially and adversely impact our operating results for a particular period.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available on terms favorable to us.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The ability of our business to grow and compete depends on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends in large part on our cash flow from operations and the availability of equity and debt financing.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, if at all, to implement our growth strategy.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	As a result, we cannot assure you that adequate capital will be available to finance our current growth plans, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Certain of our customers have been expanding and may continue to expand through consolidation and internal growth, which may increase their buying power, which could materially and adversely affect our sales, results of operations and financial position.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Certain of our customers are large companies with significant buying power.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, potential further consolidation in the distribution channels could enhance the ability of certain of our customers to seek more favorable terms, including pricing, for the products that they purchase from us.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Accordingly, our ability to maintain or raise prices in the future may be limited, including during periods of raw material and other cost increases.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P57_S4	If we are forced to reduce prices or to maintain prices during periods of increased costs, or if we lose customers because of pricing or other methods of competition, our sales, operating results and financial position may be materially and adversely affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may experience difficulties in integrating American Woodmark and RSI s operations and realizing the expected benefits of the RSI Acquisition.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The success of the RSI Acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining with RSI in an efficient and effective manner.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Further, our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our and RSI s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and could harm our financial performance.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of RSI s business with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the transaction, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	American Woodmark and RSI s important business relationships may be disrupted due to the RSI Acquisition, which could adversely affect American Woodmark s and RSI s business, respectively.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Some of the parties with which American Woodmark and RSI do business may be uncertain about their business relationships with the combined company as a result of the RSI Acquisition.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	For example, customers, partners, resellers, suppliers, vendors and others may consider entering into alternative business relationships with other parties.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Some of RSI s customers, partners, resellers, suppliers, vendors and others may decide to exercise their rights to terminate contracts that were triggered upon completion of the RSI Acquisition.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	These disruptions could have an adverse effect on RSI s and/or American Woodmark s businesses, financial condition or results of operations, or the prospects of the combined company.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our level and terms of indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position .
794619_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Our consolidated indebtedness level could have important consequences to us, including, among other things, increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; requiring a portion of our cash flow used in operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest; reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, due to the costs and expenses associated with such debt; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	In the event of a default under any of our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which in turn could result in cross-defaults under our other indebtedness.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	The lenders under our credit facilities could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans, and such lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition in a material way.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact our business.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations); incur liens; engage in mergers, consolidations and certain other fundamental changes; dispose of assets; make advances, investments and loans; engage in sale and leaseback transactions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into contractual arrangements that encumber or restrict the ability to (A) (i) pay dividends or make distributions, (ii) pay indebtedness, (iii) make loans or advances or (iv) sell, lease or transfer property, in each case to us and our subsidiaries, or (B) incur liens; pay dividends, distributions and other payments in respect of capital stock or subordinated debt; repurchase or retire capital stock, warrants or options or subordinated debt; and amend the terms of documents governing, or make payments prior to the scheduled maturity of, certain other indebtedness.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	As a result of these restrictions, each of which is subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these existing covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date.
794619_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

794619_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company accounts for these loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450.
794619_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
794619_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible, a range of loss estimate is determined and considered for disclosure.
794619_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consults with independent counsel.
794619_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company believes that the aggregate range of estimated loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims which were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of April 30, 2018.

794619_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	During the Company s fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"), the Company continued to experience improving housing market conditions from the housing market downturn that began in 2007.
794619_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	A number of general market factors impacted the Company's business in fiscal 2018, including:
794619_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Cabinet sales, as reported by members of the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA), increased by 3% during fiscal 2018 versus the prior fiscal year, suggesting an increase in both new construction and remodeling sales of cabinets.
794619_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize sales promotions in the Company s product category during fiscal 2018 to boost sales.
794619_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Company strives to maintain its promotional levels in line with market activity, with a goal of remaining competitive.
794619_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	The Company experienced promotional levels during fiscal 2018 that were higher than those experienced in its prior fiscal year.
794619_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	The Company s core remodeling sales were flat during fiscal 2018, below the overall remodeling market.
794619_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Sales in the new construction channel increased 12% during the fiscal year, 5% of which was attributable to four months of results from the Company's acquisition of RSI.
794619_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Company believes it under indexed the market due to an increase in first time home buyers.
794619_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company increased its net sales by 21% during fiscal 2018, which management believes was driven primarily by a rise in overall market activity plus four months of sales from the Company s acquisition of RSI.
794619_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross margin for fiscal 2018 was 20.4%, a decrease from 21.8% in fiscal 2017.
794619_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to higher transportation costs, raw material inflation, higher healthcare costs and $6.3 million, or 50 bps, of inventory step-up amortization.

794619_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	The reduction in total deferred tax assets from April 30, 2017 to April 30, 2018 is mainly due to the pension contributions and the reduction in the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets due to the RSI Acquisition.
794619_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
794619_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit ( ITC ) carryforwards.
794619_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	These credits expire in various years beginning in fiscal 2020.
794619_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Company believes based on positive evidence of the housing industry improvement along with 6 consecutive years of profitability that the Company will more likely than not realize all other remaining deferred tax assets.

794619_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company has concluded that none of its long-lived assets were impaired as of April 30, 2018.

794619_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	Overall unit volume for fiscal 2017 was 8.0% higher than in fiscal 2016, which was driven primarily by the Company s increased new construction and dealer volume.
794619_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Average revenue per unit increased 0.8% in fiscal 2017, driven by improvements in the Company s product mix and pricing.
794619_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 20.4% in fiscal 2018 as compared with 21.8% in fiscal 2017.
794619_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to higher transportation costs, raw material inflation, higher healthcare costs and $6.3 million, or 50 bps, of inventory step-up amortization related to the RSI Acquisition.
794619_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	During fiscal 2017, the Company s gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to 21.8% in fiscal 2017 as compared with 21.1% in fiscal 2016.
794619_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	The improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of increased sales volume, lower labor benefit costs and improved operating efficiency.
794619_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2018 were 6.2% of net sales, compared with 6.9% of net sales in fiscal 2017.

794619_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	The improvement in the percentage of sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to favorable leverage from increased sales, on-going expense control and lower display costs and commissions.

794619_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase was related to intangible amortization and RSI Acquisition related expenses, offset by lower compensation incentive costs.

794619_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Company s effective tax rate decreased from 34.6% in fiscal 2017 to 33.4% in fiscal 2018.
794619_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	The lower effective tax rate was primarily due the overall benefit from the reduction in the tax rate enacted in connection with the Tax Act, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition costs.
794619_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	The Company s effective tax rate decreased from 36.0% in fiscal 2016 to 34.6% in fiscal 2017.
794619_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the benefit from adopting ASU 2016-09 for equity based compensation.
794619_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
794619_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	In addition, we have presented in this report the non-GAAP measures described below.
794619_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below.
794619_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period s results against the corresponding prior period s results.
794619_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
794619_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
794619_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	We use Adjusted EPS per diluted share in evaluating the performance of our business and profitability.
794619_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the Company s results by providing an indication of performance and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and/or non-cash items.
794619_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We define Adjusted EPS per diluted share as diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of (1) expenses related to the RSI Acquisition, (2) inventory step-up amortization due to the increase in the fair value of inventory acquired through the RSI Acquisition (that was fully expensed in the quarter ended January 31, 2018 when the inventory was sold), (3) the amortization of intangible assets, and (4) the tax benefit of RSI Acquisition expenses and the inventory step-up and intangible amortization.
794619_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The amortization of intangible assets is driven by the RSI Acquisition and will recur in future periods.
794619_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	from our definition of Adjusted EPS per diluted share beginning with the fourth quarter earnings release as management determined that such an exclusion would better help it evaluate the performance of our business and profitability and we also received feedback from some of our investors regarding the same.
794619_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in evaluating the performance of our business, and we use each in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and profitability.
794619_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin allow us to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance.
794619_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude (1) income tax expense, (2) interest (income) expense, net, (3) depreciation and amortization expense, (4) amortization of customer relationship intangibles and trademarks, (5) expenses related to the RSI Acquisition, (6) inventory step-up amortization, (7) stock-based compensation expense, and (8) gain/loss on asset disposal.
794619_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, is useful for investors because management uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the performance of our business.
794619_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.
794619_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	To better understand and compare the performance of our core American Woodmark business by our management and our investors, we believe it is helpful to subtract the amount of sales from our recently acquired and now wholly-owned subsidiary, RSI Home Products, Inc., from our net sales and report this amount with our quarterly earnings announcements.
794619_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	We may discontinue using this non-GAAP financial measure at a later juncture once RSI has become fully integrated into our Company and the quarter to quarter comparisons of our core business are no longer as helpful to compare performance.
794619_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth in the following tables:
794619_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	(1) The inventory step-amortization is the increase in the fair value of inventory acquired through the RSI Acquisition that was fully expensed when the inventory was sold in the quarter ended January 31, 2018.
794619_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as projected for fiscal 2019 is not provided because we do not forecast Net income as we cannot, without reasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of Net income.
794619_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	(1) The inventory step-amortization is the increase in the fair value of inventory acquired through the RSI Acquisition that was fully expensed when the inventory was sold in the quarter ended January 31, 2018.
794619_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company tracks several metrics, including but not limited to housing starts, existing home sales, mortgage interest rates, new jobs growth, GDP growth and consumer confidence, which it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry.
794619_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Company believes that housing starts will continue to improve, driven by low unemployment rates and growth in new household formation.
794619_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	However, the Company expects that while the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement during fiscal 2019 it will continue to be below historical averages.

794619_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase in the Company s cash from operating activities was driven primarily by an increase in net income excluding non-cash items (primarily depreciation and amortization and changes in deferred taxes), which was partially offset by an increase in customer and income tax receivables.
794619_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was $77.1 million, compared with $74.6 million in fiscal 2016.

794619_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our core business has been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in our second and fourth fiscal quarters.
794619_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	General economic forces and changes in our customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
794619_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	RSI s historic net sales vary from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of Home Depot and Lowe s customer promotions, product roll-outs, and their inventory management.

794619_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.
794619_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the Company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment.
794619_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board.
794619_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery.
794619_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	The Company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third-party carriers but not delivered to customers.
794619_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	The estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past 12 months.
794619_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the Company believes have been delivered to the customer.
794619_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns, cash discounts and other deductions as required under U.S. GAAP.
794619_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	Collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data, including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay.
794619_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns.
794619_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The Company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns.
794619_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Company is self-insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage, workers compensation liability, general liability, auto liability and property insurance.
794619_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit total exposure.
794619_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company establishes a liability at each balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the Company s ultimate cost.
794619_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	In the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates, the financial results for the period could be adversely affected.
794619_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	The Company believes that the methodologies used to estimate insurance liabilities are an accurate reflection of the liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet.
794619_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Company has two non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans.
794619_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	The estimated expense, benefits and pension obligations of these plans are determined using various assumptions.
794619_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The most significant assumptions are the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations.
794619_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds.
794619_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Pension expense for fiscal 2018 and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in Note J of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
794619_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	At April 30, 2018, the weighted average discount rate was 4.18% compared with 4.12% at April 30, 2017.
794619_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	The expected return on plan assets was 6.5% for the year ended April 30, 2018 and 7.5% for the year ended April 30, 2017.
794619_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	The rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond April 30, 2012 because the Company froze its pension plans as of that date.
794619_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	The projected performance of the Company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets.
794619_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Over the past two measurement periods, the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have resulted from changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets.
794619_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to a current market rate at each annual measurement date.
794619_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company strives to balance expected long-term returns and short-term volatility of pension plan assets.
794619_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants.
794619_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	The actual rates of return on plan assets realized, net of investment manager fees, were 3.5%, 10.3% and (1.6)% for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
794619_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	The fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2018 was $156.5 million compared with $137.1 million at April 30, 2017.
794619_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	The Company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by $7.0 million in fiscal 2018 and by $28.0 million in fiscal 2017.
794619_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	The Company expects its pension expense to increase from $(1.6) million in fiscal 2018 to $(0.6) million in fiscal 2019, due primarily to a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return from 6.5% to 5.5%.
794619_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	The Company expects to contribute $2.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2019, which represents required and discretionary funding.
794619_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	The Company made contributions of $19.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018.
794619_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
794619_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

794619_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
794619_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	The gross amount of state tax credit carryforwards related to state ITCs as of April 30, 2018 was $5.2 million.
794619_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	These credits expire in various years beginning in fiscal 2020.
794619_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	Net of the federal impact and related valuation allowance, the Company has recorded$1.5 million of deferred tax assets related to these credits.
794619_18_ITEM7_P92_S3	The Company accounts for ITCs under the deferral method, under which the tax benefit from the ITC is deferred and amortized into income tax expense over the book life of the related property.
794619_18_ITEM7_P92_S4	As of April 30, 2018, a deferred credit balance of $1.3 million is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
794619_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
794619_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Company does not amortize goodwill but evaluates for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
794619_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.

794619_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	At the closing of the RSI Acquisition, American Woodmark assumed approximately $589 million (including accrued interest) of RSI s indebtedness consisting largely of RSI s 6 % Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the "RSI Notes").
794619_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	(See Note G-- Loans Payable and Long-Term Debt ).
794619_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	As consideration for the RSI Acquisition, American Woodmark paid total accounting consideration of $554.2 million including cash consideration of $364.4 million, net of cash acquired, and 1,457,568 newly issued shares of American Woodmark common stock valued at $189.8 million based on $130.25 per share, which was the closing stock price on the Acquisition Date.
794619_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	The consideration paid was subject to a working capital adjustment by which the consideration was adjusted as the amount of working capital delivered at the Acquisition Date was less than a target amount.
794619_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	The working capital adjustment has been finalized and the accounting consideration does reflect the adjustment to the estimated working capital reflected in the consideration paid at the Acquisition Date.
794619_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company accounted for the acquisition of RSI as a business combination, which requires the Company to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value.
794619_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	The amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
794619_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	The Company has commenced the appraisals necessary to assess the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the Acquisition Date.
794619_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	The amounts recorded for certain assets and liabilities are preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the Acquisition Date.
794619_18_ITEM8_P48_S4	The final determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period of up to one year from the Acquisition Date permitted under GAAP.
794619_18_ITEM8_P48_S5	The final values may also result in changes to depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets such as buildings, equipment and intangible assets.
794619_18_ITEM8_P48_S6	Any potential adjustments made could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented in the table below.
794619_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The following table summarizes the allocation of the preliminary purchase price as of the Acquisition Date, which is based on the accounting consideration of $554.2 million , to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):
794619_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminarily determined using income, market and cost valuation methodologies.
794619_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	The fair value of debt acquired was determined using Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities were available.
794619_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	The fair value measurements, aside from debt, were estimated using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820.
794619_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The income approach was primarily used to value the customer relationship intangibles and trademarks.
794619_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The income approach determines value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured.
794619_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective.
794619_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	Our estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected product pricing, operational performance including company specific synergies, product life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors.
794619_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The net cash flows are discounted to present value using a discount rate that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money.
794619_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	The market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities, or a group of assets or liabilities.
794619_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The cost approach estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility.
794619_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.
794619_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	The cost and market approaches were used to value inventory, while the cost approach was the primary approach used to value property, plant and equipment.
794619_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $767.5 million of goodwill, which is not expected to be amortizable for tax purposes.
794619_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	The goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergies generated by the integration of the Company s products with RSI's, cost synergies resulting from purchasing and manufacturing activities, and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as the assembled workforce of RSI.
794619_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Customer receivables were recorded at the contractual amounts due of $57.1 million , less an allowance for returns and discounts of $2.4 million , and an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.1 million , which approximates their fair value.
794619_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the exercise of significant judgment, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates.
794619_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	The cash flows employed in the valuation are based on the Company s best estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, expected future customer orders, contracts with suppliers, labor costs, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance.
794619_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	Use of different estimates and judgments could yield different results.
794619_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	RSI s financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results for the period from the Acquisition Date to April 30, 2018.
794619_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	As a result, our consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018 do not reflect a full year of RSI results.
794619_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	From December 29, 2017 to April 30, 2018, RSI generated net sales of approximately $177.7 million and an operating income of approximately $9.1 million , inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustments to account for the acquisition, including a $6.3 million charge to cost of sales as a result of the step-up of inventory as of the Acquisition Date to fair value.
794619_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company incurred approximately $12.9 million of transaction costs associated with the RSI Acquisition during the twelve months ended April 30, 2018 which the Company expensed as incurred.
794619_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	These costs are included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
794619_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	The following table presents summarized unaudited pro forma financial information as if RSI had been included in the Company s financial results for the entire fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2017:
794619_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	(1) Includes stock compensation expense of $17.5 million and $7.4 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, calculated under the intrinsic value method in measuring stock-based liability awards related to stock-based grants made by RSI prior to the RSI Acquisition.
794619_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial data above assumes the RSI Acquisition occurred on May 1, 2016 and has been calculated after applying the Company s accounting policies and adjusting the historical results of RSI with pro forma adjustments, net of a statutory tax rate of 34.4% and 40.4% for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
794619_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	Significant pro forma adjustments include the recognition of additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets (net of historical amortization expense of RSI), additional interest expense related to the initial term loan facility used to finance the acquisition, and elimination of the inventory fair value step-up expense and transaction related expenses which are non-recurring in nature.
794619_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	These adjustments assume the application of fair value adjustments to intangibles and that the $300.0 million borrowed under the Credit Agreement occurred on May 1, 2016 and are as follows: amortization expense, net of tax, of $20.0 million and $27.2 million for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively; interest expense, net of tax, (including amortization expense related to $6.7 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized over a period of 5 years ) of $2.4 million and $4.4 million for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
794619_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	The following amounts have been excluded: inventory fair value step-up expense, net of tax, of $4.1 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018; and transaction expense add-back, net of tax, of $8.5 million and $1.6 million for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2017.
794619_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information does not reflect the realization of any expected ongoing cost or revenue synergies relating to the integration of the two companies.
794619_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	Further, the pro forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the RSI Acquisition, related financing and associated issuance of Senior Notes (defined herein) and repurchase or redemption of the RSI Notes had been actually consummated on May 1, 2016, nor are they indicative of future results.
794619_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The components of customer receivables were:

794619_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering many of the Company s employees hired prior to April 30, 2012.
794619_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	These plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average earnings (for salaried employees) or benefit rate (for hourly employees).
794619_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans.
794619_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at April 30, 2018 is $66.1 million ( $49.1 million net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension benefit costs.
794619_18_ITEM8_P127_S1	The Company expects to recognize $1.6 million ( $1.2 million net of tax) in net actuarial losses in net periodic pension benefit costs during fiscal 2019.
794619_18_ITEM8_P127_S2	The Company uses an April 30 measurement date for its benefit plans.
794619_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company s non-contributory defined benefit pension plans as of April 30:
794619_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for both pension plans was $163.4 million and $165.2 million at April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
794619_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	The components of net periodic pension benefit cost do not include service costs or prior service costs due to the plans being frozen.
794619_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	Actuarial Assumptions : The discount rate at April 30 was used to measure the year-end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year.
794619_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and earnings effects for the pension plans follow:
794619_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	The Company bases the discount rate on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period.
794619_18_ITEM8_P132_S1	The long-term rate of return on assets is determined based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy.
794619_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	Beginning with the April 30, 2016 measurement, the Company refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of its net periodic benefit cost.
794619_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve.
794619_18_ITEM8_P133_S2	Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each benefit payment will be used.
794619_18_ITEM8_P133_S3	The Company believes this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.
794619_18_ITEM8_P133_S4	Compared to the previous method, the spot rate approach decreased the service and interest components of the benefit costs in fiscal 2017.
794619_18_ITEM8_P133_S5	There was no impact on the total benefit obligation.
794619_18_ITEM8_P133_S6	The Company accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
794619_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions.
794619_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company amortizes experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, over the average remaining lifetime of the active participants.
794619_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	Contributions: The Company funds the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts the Company deems appropriate.
794619_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Company expects to contribute $2.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2019.
794619_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	The Company made contributions of $19.3 million and $27.3 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
794619_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	Estimated Future Benefit Payments : The following benefit payments are expected to be paid:
794619_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	Plan Assets: Pension assets by major category and the type of fair value measurement as of April 30, 2018 and 2017 are presented in the following tables:
794619_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	1 As discussed in Note A, investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have been removed from the total plan assets in the fair value hierarchy.
794619_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with its pension plans.
794619_18_ITEM8_P141_S1	The objectives of the investment strategies include preservation of capital and long-term growth of capital while avoiding excessive risk.
794619_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by the Company s Pension Committee.
794619_18_ITEM8_P142_S1	Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and the Pension Committee may approve allocations above or below a target range.
794619_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	During a period of uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets, the Pension Committee may suspend the Target Asset Allocation and manage the investment mix as it sees reasonable, prudent and in the best interest of the plans to better protect the value of the plan assets.
794619_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company s pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at April 30, 2018 and 2017, by asset category, were as follows:
794619_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	Within the broad categories outlined in the preceding table, the Company has the following specific allocations as a percentage of total funds invested: 60% Bond and 40% Equity.
794619_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	Comprehensive tax legislation enacted through the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, significantly modified U.S. corporate income tax law.
794619_18_ITEM8_P146_S1	In addition to the law's corporate income tax rate reduction, several other provisions are pertinent to the Company's financial statements and related disclosures for the year ended April 30, 2018 or will have an impact on taxes in future years.
794619_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	No. 118 ( SAB 118 ) which provides SEC guidance on the application of ASC 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law.
794619_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	Accordingly, the Company s financial statements as of January 31, 2018 reflected provisional amounts for those impacts for which the accounting under ASC 740 was incomplete, but a reasonable estimate could be determined.
794619_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	tax law in effect prior to the enactment of the Tax Act.
794619_18_ITEM8_P148_S1	As of April 30, 2018, the Company is still in the process of completing the accounting for the impact of the Tax Act.
794619_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	We recorded a provisional expense of $ 1.6 million related to the re-valuation of U.S. deferred taxes as of January 31, 2018.
794619_18_ITEM8_P149_S1	During the three months ending April 30, 2018, we have further refined the calculation of the impact to reflect actual full-year activity and adjusted the provisional expense to $1.0 million .
794619_18_ITEM8_P149_S2	The Company may further adjust these amounts in future periods if our interpretation of the Tax Act changes or as additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury becomes available.
794619_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	We had not recorded an estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on the existing deferred tax assets related to executive compensation as of January 31, 2018 as no reasonable estimate could be made at the time.
794619_18_ITEM8_P150_S1	During the three months ending April 30, 2018, we have determined that a reasonable estimate of the impact is a reduction in deferred tax asset and a related expense of $0.1 million.
794619_18_ITEM8_P150_S2	This estimate is provisional and the Company may further adjust these amounts in future periods if our interpretation of the Tax Act changes or as additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury becomes available.
794619_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	Income tax expense was comprised of the following:
794619_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company's effective income tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate as follows:
794619_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	Note that the Company's federal statutory rate for 2018 is calculated by using a blended rate comprising of the pre-Tax Act 35% federal statutory rate from May 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and 21% for the period from January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2018.
794619_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	Due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal year 2017, excess tax benefits of stock compensation were recorded in tax expense while in previous years excess benefits were recorded in additional paid-in-capital and therefore, did not impact the effective tax rate.
794619_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
794619_18_ITEM8_P156_S0	We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
794619_18_ITEM8_P156_S1	Undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations are not significant as of April 30, 2018.
794619_18_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit (ITC) carryforwards.
794619_18_ITEM8_P157_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
794619_18_ITEM8_P157_S2	In fiscal 2018, the Company reassessed the valuation allowance related to ITCs and released $21 thousand of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal 2016.
794619_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	The gross amount of state tax credit carryforwards related to state ITCs as of April 30, 2018 and 2017 was $5.2 million and $6.1 million .
794619_18_ITEM8_P158_S1	These credits expire in various years beginning in fiscal 2020.
794619_18_ITEM8_P158_S2	Net of the federal impact and related valuation allowance, the Company recorded $1.5 million and $1.6 million of deferred tax assets related to these credits, as of April 30, 2018 and 2017.
794619_18_ITEM8_P158_S3	The Company accounts for ITCs under the deferral method, under which the tax benefit from the ITC is deferred and amortized into income tax expense over the book life of the related property.
794619_18_ITEM8_P158_S4	As of April 30, 2018 and 2017, a deferred credit balance of $1.3 million and $1.5 million , respectively, is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
794619_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company accounts for its income tax uncertainties in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
794619_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the federal tax benefit of state tax deductions:
794619_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions and, in the normal course of business, its tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities.
794619_18_ITEM8_P161_S1	Such examinations may result in future assessments by these taxing authorities, and the Company has accrued a liability when it believes that it is not more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of tax positions that it has taken or for the amount of any tax benefit that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance with accounting standards.
794619_18_ITEM8_P161_S2	As of April 30, 2018, Federal tax years 2014 through 2017 remain subject to examination.
794619_18_ITEM8_P161_S3	The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for all tax returns subject to examination.
794619_18_ITEM8_P161_S4	The Company is currently not under federal audit.
794619_18_ITEM8_P161_S5	If the liability for uncertain tax positions is released the entire amount would impact the Company s effective tax rate.
794619_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims, and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
794619_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	On at least a quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.
794619_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	As required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible and those that are deemed to be remote.
794619_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made.
