1131096_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms the Company, athenahealth, we, us, and our refer to athenahealth, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Anodyne Health Partners, Inc., athenahealth MA, Inc., athenahealth Security Corporation, and athenahealth Technology Private Limited, and any subsidiary that may be acquired or formed in the future.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on August 21, 1997, as Athena Healthcare Incorporated.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We changed our name to athenahealth.com, Inc. on March 31, 2000, and to athenahealth, Inc. on November 17, 2000.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts, 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	athenahealth provides business services that help medical practices achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more money and improving their control over administrative tasks.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	These services are designed to reduce the administrative burden of complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication, and many of the related tasks that distract medical providers and staff from the practice of medicine.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud-based platform, athenaNet.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	We differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements through athenaNet to clients without any action on the part of the client.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	athenaNet enables us to quickly implement our service offerings at a low up-front cost and to seamlessly work in tandem with our clients in real time.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	The services provided through our single-instance cloud are currently packaged as three integrated components: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management, athenaClinicals for clinical cycle management, and athenaCommunicator for patient cycle management.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	The use of our single-instance platform allows all clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of all of our other clients through our patented billing Rules Engine and our clinical Quality Management Engine, collectively called the athenaRules.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our clients use these rules engines to monitor and benchmark their performance with peer practices across the network.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	Our business intelligence application, Anodyne Analytics, also supports our clients in their pursuit of financial health by equipping users with data visualization tools and insight into their practice s performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct components: Software, Knowledge, and Work.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	The cloud-based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients, payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	Knowledge is infused into each of our services via our athenaRules as we work with clients, payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The third component to each of our services is the Work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Wherever possible, we replace manual processes with automation, but where automation is not possible, we provide that manual labor rather than returning it to clients to be completed.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	This unique service model of Software, Knowledge, and Work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance, creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	We charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases, so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	In 2000, we released our first service offering, athenaCollector, and we released athenaClinicals in 2006.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	athenaCommunicator, introduced in 2010, represented the integration and rebranding of our first acquisition, Crest Line Technologies, LLC (d.b.a. MedicalMessaging.net).
1131096_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	We continued this expansion of our offerings in October 2009 with our newest acquisition, Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. ( Anodyne ), the privately held company that developed the Anodyne Analytics service.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	In 2010, we generated revenue of $245.5 million from the sale of our services, compared to $188.5 million in 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there were 27,114 medical providers, including 19,197 physicians, using our athenaCollector service across 45 states and the District of Columbia and 60 medical specialties.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The healthcare industry is complex and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that do not offer the core competencies of collaboration, flexibility, and interoperability.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	A disproportionate amount of communication still takes place on paper instead of automated communications.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	The combination of outdated, inflexible systems and paper workflows creates significant costs for medical practices as a result of administrative work, duplication, and errors.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	By addressing these problems head on, medical practices can free their staff to focus on the practice of medicine.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	While fee-for-service reimbursement is fraught with complexity for physician practices, managed care plans typically are even more complex, creating reimbursement structures with greater complexity than previous methods and placing greater responsibility on physician practices to capture and provide appropriate data to obtain payments.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	This reality is further complicated by newer, emerging reimbursement models such as Pay-For-Reporting, Pay-For-Performance, and Shared Savings.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	programs for which they are eligible, enroll in those programs, identify eligible patients, and record relevant billing and clinical data for each eligible encounter.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	In addition, providers may be penalized for non-reporting or non-participation in these programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	Many of these programs also require a much greater focus on coordination of care and cost efficiency across multiple providers.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Physician practice-based activities that are required to ensure appropriate payment for services rendered have increased in number and complexity for the following reasons:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Legislative reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, that was signed into law in March 2010, is expected to drive many fundamental shifts in the healthcare reimbursement landscape.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Millions of additional patients could be required to purchase health insurance coverage, and private payers may have to limit percentages of non-clinical expenses as a portion of their revenues.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	Payers ability to raise insurance premiums will likely also be regulated, forcing them to focus on other ways of improving their financial performance, including new contracting options for physicians and new programs to identify preventable costs.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	Many of these programs would require the aggregation and exchange of clinical data in order to ensure continuity of care for each patient.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Diversity of health benefit plan design.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Health insurers have introduced a wide range of benefit structures, many of which are customized to unique goals of particular employer groups.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	This has resulted in an increase in rules regarding who is eligible for healthcare services, what healthcare services are eligible for reimbursement, and who is responsible for payment for healthcare services delivered.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	It has also resulted in more plans with a larger portion of patient responsibility, such as High Deductible Health Plans ( HDHP ) or plans with little coverage other than negotiated discounts, increasing the burden on practices to manage and pursue receivables directly with the patient.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Dynamic nature of health benefit plan design.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Health insurers continually update their reimbursement rules based on ongoing monitoring of consumption patterns, in response to new medical products and procedures, and to address changing employer demands.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	As these changes are made frequently throughout the year and are often specific to each individual health plan, physician practices need to be continually aware of this dynamic element of the reimbursement cycle, as it could impact overall reimbursement and specific workflows.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	New health benefit plans and reimbursement structures have considerably modified the ways in which physician practices are paid.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Care-based initiatives, including Pay-for-Performance, which provide reimbursement incentives centered around capture and submission of specified clinical information, have dramatically increased the administrative and clinical documentation burden of the physician practice.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Shared Savings programs, including Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, reward providers for managing care cost-efficiently, requiring much more coordination of clinical effort across physician practices and their trading partners.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	These newer models are continuing to evolve and grow in both number and complexity.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	New financial incentives spurring a new wave of EHR purchasing activity.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The federal government has enacted a financial incentive program through the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act ) for providers who demonstrate Meaningful Use of a certified Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) technology.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	While these payments do not represent a sustained market opportunity, they have shifted recent buying patterns, with many providers accelerating their purchase of EHRs and making revenue cycle decisions tied to the EHR selection.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	In addition to administering typical business functions, physician practices must invest significant time and resources processing inbound and outbound communications related to physician orders, including referrals to specialists, imaging centers, laboratories, pharmacies, and inpatient admissions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	In order to process these communications, physician practices often interact with multiple software systems; execute paper-based and fax-based communications to and from payers; and contact patients, payers, and other trading partners to effectively communicate the appropriate clinical information to accompany the order.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	also be conducted to ensure that the patient receives appropriate care and that the procedure is eligible for reimbursement.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our mission is to be the most trusted business service to medical groups.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	In almost all cases, we price our services as a percentage of practice collections which incentivizes us to increase their performance while simultaneously reducing cost through more efficient operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	As physician practices face rising costs, rising complexity, and changing reimbursement rates, they will need solutions for a diverse set of problems.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	These problems include more administrative work to manage new reimbursement models; greater demand from trading partners and Shared Savings program members for electronic exchange of data; pressure to adopt expensive EHRs; continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards; new insurance payer rules; more complicated reimbursement structures; and increased work to collect self-pay balances for uninsured, underinsured, and HDHP patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that traditional, locally installed software fails to address all of these needs, solving only the subset of problems that can be managed through electronic storage and transmission of data without allowing for intelligent evolution of the functionality.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Locally installed software also favors larger organizations that can afford an up-front investment in hardware and software as well as the staff to manage and maintain these systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Software that is cloud-based can solve a greater set of these problems particularly when implemented in a single instance because it can be quickly updated and delivered to all clients without expensive upgrades or new hardware installation.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	However, there remain many challenges that even cloud-based software alone cannot address without a corresponding service component.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P25_S4	Examples include processing and sorting all incoming paper documents that a practice receives, identifying and managing payer rules, identifying and enrolling providers in Pay-For-Performance programs, selecting and alerting providers to Pay-for-Performance measures for specific patients, and taking phone calls from patients with a live operator when a practice is closed.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P25_S5	Our unique service model addresses these problems for clients through cloud-based software that delivers targeted knowledge to the right user at the right time and through large service operations that can achieve comparative advantage by executing work that would otherwise fall upon the practice.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The electronic connectivity and system infrastructure that we provide would normally be out of reach for small independent practices, which represent the majority of the physician market.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	However, our ability to automate processes and scale work across our entire provider network allows our services to be efficiently delivered to medical practices of every size.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	By enabling small practices to receive the same level of technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefit to physician practices as well as to all of their trading partners and fellow Shared Savings program members.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	As physician practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility will enhance our ability to compete, regardless of whether the practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Key elements of our strategy include:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Remaining intensely focused on our clients success.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our business model aligns our goals with our clients goals and provides us with an ongoing incentive to improve client performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	We believe that this approach enables us to maintain client loyalty (demonstrated through high and sustained client satisfaction and retention), enhance our reputation, and improve the quality of our solutions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Integration of revenue cycle, clinical cycle, and patient cycle.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	As payment models continue to integrate cost efficiency and performance into reimbursement formulas, activities that previously were not factors in reimbursement will become more important in driving practice performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	Only practices that control these activities in a way that is fully integrated with their revenue cycle will have visibility into the financial health of their business.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	Some examples might be care handoffs between physicians and trading partners, care coordination to prevent duplicate procedures, patient adherence reminders, and closed-loop order management.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	We proactively demonstrate to practices how, when fully adopted and optimized, a combined athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, and athenaCommunicator solution can help them manage and monitor performance comprehensively.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our Rules Engine leverages our single-instance platform to allow all clients to benefit from knowledge across the network.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	We proactively seek out new revenue opportunities for practices and use the Rules Engine to deliver the right information to the right person at the right time.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	For athenaCollector clients, these rules are introduced during charge entry and claim submission to alert users to any errors or omissions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	This increases the percentage of transactions that are successfully executed on the first attempt and reduces the time to resolution after claims or other transactions are submitted.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	We continue to build our centralized payer reimbursement rules by learning from the collective experience of our national network of clients as well as through proactive outreach to payers.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The rules embedded in athenaClinicals are becoming increasingly tied to reimbursement as more Pay-for-Reporting, Pay-for-Performance, and other bonus payments require specific action at the point of care.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	The athenaClinicals workflow allows customizable alerts to surface during the encounter to ensure that the proper quality measures are being prompted.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The administrative burden of these payment programs could significantly impair physicians ability to practice without the type of automation included in our Quality Management Engine.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Increasing awareness and attracting new clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	We will continue to expand sales and marketing efforts to address our market opportunity by aggressively seeking new clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	We believe that our cloud-based business services provide significant value for physician practices of any size.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	Our athenaCollector client base currently represents less approximately three percent of the U.S. addressable market, comprised of an estimated 650,000 physicians practicing in the ambulatory segment.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	In addition to our traditional marketing efforts to small and group practices market, we have introduced several new programs to reach hospitals and health systems and help them manage their affiliated and employed physician strategies.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Uncovering and delivering new sources of revenue to clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	We have worked closely with payers and other healthcare trading partners to demonstrate the process efficiencies and reduction in administrative work that our services provide to medical practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	We believe that, as these trading partners gain understanding of these advantages and the related system-wide benefits, they will reward these efficiencies in a manner that accrues direct benefits to our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	High levels of user adoption and network transparency.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	One of the biggest challenges for traditional EHR software vendors has been lack of physician adoption.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Many physicians fear that EHRs will slow them down and have not habitually documented encounters using software templates.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Traditional documentation styles such as paper or dictation are preferred in many cases.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Due to our large service operation, we can support many alternate documentation styles that are not available with software-only solutions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	For example, physicians can continue to document on paper and transmit that document to us to be processed and attached to the patient chart.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	By supporting multiple work styles and integrating these activities into the complete revenue, clinical, and patient cycles, our clients realize significant benefits by utilizing the EHR, which drives our high adoption rate.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P38_S4	We, in turn, convert this usage data into system-wide measures of top-line practice performance, individual clinician performance, and the associated drivers of each.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P38_S5	We can then share this intelligence on the measures that correlate with, or drive, practice performance with our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our service offerings are based on our proprietary cloud-based software, a continually updated database of rules, and integrated back-office service operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our services are designed to help our clients achieve faster reimbursement from all parties, reduce error rates, increase collections, lower operating costs, improve operational workflow controls, and more efficiently manage clinical and billing information.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our principal offering, athenaCollector, is our revenue cycle management service that automates and manages billing-related functions for physician practices and includes a practice management platform.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	athenaCollector assists our physician clients with the proper handling of claims and billing processes to help manage reimbursement quickly and efficiently.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	Complementing athenaCollector is our business intelligence offering, Anodyne Analytics, which provides physicians and practice managers with detailed insight into practice performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Through athenaNet, athenaCollector utilizes the Internet to connect physician practices to our Rules Engine and service operations team.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	athenaCollector is a complete practice management system that includes scheduling, payment processing, and a workflow dashboard.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	The system is used by our clients and our services team to track claims requiring edits in real-time before they are sent to the payer, claims requiring work that have come back from the payer unpaid, and claims that are being held up due to administrative steps required by the individual client.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	This web-native functionality provides our clients with the benefits of our database of payer rules as it is updated and enables them to interact with our services team to efficiently monitor workflows.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P43_S3	Each transaction runs through our centralized Rules Engine so that preventable mistakes can be corrected quickly across all of our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P43_S4	We also include a full set of reporting tools in athenaNet so that users can track their ongoing performance and benchmark against other practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	With the acquisition of our newest acquisition, Anodyne, in October 2009, we expanded the business intelligence function of our existing services through the addition of Anodyne Analytics.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	that data visually through a wide array of business performance metrics.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	These metrics can be provided either as broad, practice-wide summaries or as discrete, highly specific analyses based on complex user-defined requests.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	In the future, we plan to further leverage the additional detail and analysis offered by Anodyne Analytics and the Anodyne Intelligence Platform to present visually other data sets such as clinical and patient cycle metrics.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Physician practices route all of their day-to-day electronic and paper-based payer communications to us, which we then process using our patented billing Rules Engine and our service operations to avoid reimbursement delays and improve practice performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our proprietary database of payer knowledge has been constructed based on over ten years of experience in handling the physician workflow in thousands of physician practices with medical claims from tens of thousands of health benefit packages.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	The core focus of the database is on the payer rules, which are the key drivers of claim payment and denials.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	Understanding denials allows us to construct rules to avoid future denials across our entire client base, resulting in increased automation of our workflow processes.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	On average, over 100 rules are added or revised in our Rules Engine each month.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	athenaRules has been designed to interact seamlessly with athenaNet in the medical office workflow and with our service operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	athenahealth service operations enables the service teams that collaborate with client staff to achieve successful transactions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our service operations consists of both knowledgeable staff and technological infrastructure used to execute the key steps associated with proper handling of physician claims and clinical data management.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	The service operations team is comprised of 691 people who interact with physicians, providers, and clinicians at all of the key steps in the revenue cycle, including:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	providing proactive and responsive client support to manage issues, address questions, identify training needs, and communicate trends.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	athenaClinicals is our EHR service that automates and manages medical-record-management-related functions for physician practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	It assists medical groups with the proper handling of physician documentation, orders, and related inbound and outbound communications to ensure that orders are carried out quickly and accurately.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	athenaClinicals is designed to improve clinical administrative workflow.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Through athenaNet, athenaClinicals displays key clinical measures by office location related to the drivers of high quality and efficient care delivery on a workflow dashboard, including lab results requiring review, patient referral requests, prescription requests, and family history of previous exams.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	athenaClinicals is a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR technology and has been certified by the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology ( CCHIT ), an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	Similar to its functionality within athenaCollector, athenaNet provides comprehensive reporting on a range of clinical results, including distribution of different procedure codes (leveling), incidence of different diagnoses, timeliness of turnaround by lab companies and other intermediaries, and other key performance indicators.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Reporting and quality programs have collectively become a greater portion of physician revenue but are very difficult to manage on paper or in a static software system that does not prompt the user for the appropriate action to be taken.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Clinical data must be captured according to the requirements and incentives of different payers and plans.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Clinical intermediaries such as laboratories and pharmacy networks require specific formats and data elements as well.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	athenaRules is designed to access medication formularies, identify potential medication errors (such as drug-to-drug interactions or allergy reactions), and identify the specific clinical activities that are required to adhere to Pay-for-Performance programs, including Medicare incentive payments under the HITECH Act.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Medical practices that use an EHR still receive large amounts of paper documentation from third parties.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	These can include consult letters, lab results, general correspondence, and multiple other document types.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	Practices can receive an average of over 1,000 clinical documents per provider per month, creating a significant administrative burden.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	We capture inbound paper documents, convert them to electronic format, attach them to the appropriate patient chart, classify them according to type, and associate results with the original order where applicable.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	Additionally, even if the physician creates an order in the EHR, the intended recipient may not accept orders electronically.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	delivery on behalf of the practice.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	We also perform many of the Pay-for-Performance program identification and enrollment tasks on behalf of practices so that they can participate without significant up-front research and effort.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Through athenaNet, athenaCommunicator which includes ReminderCall (part of the acquisition of Crest Line Technologies, LLC in September 2008) and other automated patient messaging services, live operator services, and a patient portal was commercially released in the first half of 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	These services help to reduce patient no-show rates and improve overall schedule density, which increases the number of revenue-generating appointments for our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	The ability to increase patient outreach also helps to provide clinical education and adherence reminders to patients, which increases the quality of care and improves outcomes without increasing practice work to monitor and contact patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	The service provides a personalized, high-quality experience for patients while driving practice performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	athenaCommunicator allows practices to manage many patient communication tasks electronically, including use of automated reminder calls with customizable criteria and opt-out functionality; creation of a self-service patient portal for registration, appointment requests, bill payments, and general communication; automatic generation of emails to patients; and patient education tools.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	The automated phone calls are multi-purpose and may include appointment reminders, outbound campaigns, and follow-up on outstanding balances while prompting patients to make payments by mail, telephone, or online through our systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	athenaCommunicator allows practices to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	They can set patient or group-specific communication preferences that will automatically tailor communications to the preferred timing and mode of delivery, including phone call, e-mail, or patient portal.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	These communication rules allow each patient to receive a personalized experience, including delivery of messages with branding and using the Caller ID of the practice, if desired.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Practices spend a great deal of time fielding phone calls from patients on topics ranging from scheduling requests, bill payment, directions, and clinical cases.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	As part of the athenaCommunicator service, we provider live operators who field these calls on behalf of practices, including redirected automated calls for appointment scheduling, patient payments, and message-taking on behalf of the practice.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	We also print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of the practice to assist with patient payment collection.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	Collectively, these activities extend the availability of the office to patients and help to free staff time to focus on more critical tasks.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our service offerings in response to changes in the market and evolving our technology platform to better serve physician practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	All of our clients use the same version of our software, although some athenaRules are designed to take effect only locally for particular clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	We continually update our software and rules, executing bimonthly releases of new software functionality for our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	Our software development life cycle methodology ensures that each software release is properly designed, built, tested, and rolled out.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our software development technologists are primarily located in the United States.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	We complement this team s work with software development services from third-party technology development providers in Huntsville, Alabama, and Pune, India, and with our own employees at our development center operated through our subsidiary located in Chennai, India.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	In addition to our core software development activities, we dedicate full-time staff to our ongoing development and maintenance of the rules database.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	We also employ program management and product management personnel, who work continually on improvements to our service operations processes and our service design, respectively.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	The team behind the athenaRules is based in Watertown, Massachusetts, and is supported by employees at all of our locations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	This team is responsible for creation of the billing rules that alert clients to potential problems on claims and for the creation of the clinical rules that alert clinical staff to quality measures applicable to particular patients and encounters.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	Some key metrics delivered by the athenaIntelligence team in 2010 were:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	94.4% of claims were resolved on the first submission.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	Taken as a whole, these activities result, in most cases, in a direct reduction in practices work.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Rather than submitting a claim with missing information, waiting for adjudication, receiving a denial, and then resubmitting the claim to start the cycle over again, our practices are alerted prior to the first submission.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	Similarly, they are spared the tedious process of identifying upcoming appointments for patients that qualify for a specific Pay-for-Performance program and remembering to track the appropriate measure during the encounter; instead, athenaClinicals introduces the measure seamlessly into the workflow.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our operations team assists clients at each critical step in the revenue cycle, clinical cycle, and patient cycle workflow process and provides services that include insurance benefits packaging, insurance eligibility confirmation, claims submission, claims tracking, remittance posting, denials management, payment processing, formatting of lab requisitions, submission of lab requisitions, and monitoring and classification of all inbound faxes.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	Additionally, we use third parties for data entry, data matching, data characterization, and outbound and inbound telephone services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	We have contracted with International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our operations team.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	These services are generally commercially available at comparable rates from other service providers.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	delivered 34.4 million automated calls to patients on behalf of practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	We depend on satisfied clients to succeed.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	Our client contracts require minimum commitments by us on a range of tasks, including claims submission, payment posting, claims tracking, and claims denial management.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	We also commit to our clients that athenaNet is accessible 99.7% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Each quarter, our management conducts a survey of clients to identify client concerns and track progress against client satisfaction objectives.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	In our most recent survey for athenaCollector, 88% of the respondents reported that they would recommend our services to a trusted friend or colleague.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	In addition to the services described above, we also provide client support services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	There are several client support service activities that take place on a regular basis, including the following:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	relationship management by regional leaders of the client services organization to ensure that decision-makers at client practices are satisfied and that regional performance is managed proactively with regard to client satisfaction, client margins, client retention, renewal pricing, and added services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	The increased burden on patients to pay for a larger percentage of their healthcare services, together with the need for providers to have the ability to determine this patient payment responsibility at the time of service, has led some payers to develop the capability to accept and process claims in real time.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	This capability is frequently referred to within the industry as real time adjudication (or RTA ) because it avoids the processing time that adjudication of claims by payers has historically involved.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Under an RTA system, payers notify physicians immediately upon receipt of billing information if third-party claims are accepted or rejected, the amount that will be paid by the payer, and the amount that the patient may owe under the particular health plan involved.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	Taking advantage of this payer capability, we have designed a platform for transacting with payer RTA systems that is payer-neutral and designed to integrate the various payer RTA processes so that our clients experience the same workflow regardless of payer.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P78_S2	Using this platform, we have collaborated with two major payers, Humana and United Healthcare, to process RTA transactions with their systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of physician clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	We expect to expand our network by selling our services to new clients and cross-selling additional services into our client base.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	Our sales force is divided into three groups: the enterprise team, which is dedicated to professionally managed physician organizations with 150 or more physicians; the group team, which is dedicated to physician practices with five to 149 physicians; and the small group team, which is dedicated to physician practices with one to four physicians.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients, we conduct a consultative sales process.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	This process includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	We refer to these third parties as channels and the individuals and organizations involved as our channel partners.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P82_S2	In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for providing us sales lead information that results in sales.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P82_S3	These channel partners generally do not make sales but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P82_S4	Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as an independent sales representative, purchasing agent (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or a joint marketer of combined service offerings that we jointly develop with that third party.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P82_S5	In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P82_S6	In 2010, channel-based leads were associated with approximately half of our new business.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	product distribution companies, consulting firms, group purchasing organizations, regional extension centers, and payers.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Examples of these types of channel relationships include:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	In August 2010, we entered into an alliance with Humana to promote a program to reward quality, efficiency, and improved coordination of care for Humana s Medicare beneficiaries.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	Under this program, eligible physicians can receive a subsidy from Humana for the purchase of our athenaClinicals service and earn additional revenue above their current fee schedule for meeting certain performance criteria.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	Humana is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	d/b/a PSS World Medical Shared Services, Inc. ( PSS ).
1131096_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	In October 2010, we entered into an agreement with PSS for the marketing and sale of our revenue cycle, clinical cycle, and patient cycle services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, PSS has a non-exclusive right to distribute, sell, market, and promote our services in the United States (excluding Hawaii) and we will pay PSS commissions based upon the contract value of client orders placed with PSS.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	According to PSS, they are the largest provider of medical and surgical supplies to the physician market in the United States, with a sales force consisting of more than 750 sales consultants who distribute medical supplies and equipment to more than 100,000 offices in all 50 states.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Since our service model is new to most physicians, our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so that they will view our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our marketing initiatives are generally targeted towards specific segments of the physician practice market.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	These marketing programs primarily consist of:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	In June 2006, we introduced our annual PayerView rankings in order to provide an industry-unique framework to systematically address what we believe is administrative complexity existing between payers and providers.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	PayerView is designed to look at payers performance based on a number of categories, which combine to provide an overall ranking aimed at quantifying the ease of doing business with the payer.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P90_S2	All data used for the rankings come from actual claims performance data of our clients and depict our experience in dealing with individual payers across the nation.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P90_S3	The rankings include payers that meet a threshold of 3,500 claims per quarter in athenaNet.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	Our primary competition is the use of locally installed software to manage revenue cycle, clinical cycle, and patient cycle workflow within the physician s office.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	Other nationwide competitors have begun introducing services that they refer to as on-demand or software-as-a- service models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P91_S3	Software and service companies that sell practice management and EHR software and medical billing and collection services include GE Healthcare; Sage Software Healthcare, Inc.; Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.; eClinicalWorks, LLC; and Quality Systems, Inc.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P91_S4	As a service company that provides revenue cycle services, we also compete against large billing companies such as McKesson Corp.; Ingenix, a division of United Healthcare, Inc.; and regional billing companies.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition than we do, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P93_S2	As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P93_S3	These companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, and patent prosecution and litigation and to finance capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the services that we provide are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws and regulations, including regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as additional regulation.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it (collectively, HIPAA ) contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	These are embodied in the Privacy Rule and Security Rule portions of HIPAA.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	The Privacy Rule imposes a complex system of requirements on covered entities for complying with this basic standard.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules apply directly to covered entities, such as healthcare providers who engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from the HIPAA-prescribed electronic forms and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse, and as such are a covered entity.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P98_S2	In addition, our clients are also covered entities.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	In order to provide clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules require us to enter into business associate agreements with our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	that we will assist the client in question with certain of its duties under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	In addition to the Privacy and Security Rules, HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to health care billing be conducted using prescribed electronic formats.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	For example, claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to payers must comply with specific formatting standards, and these standards apply whether the payer is a government or a private entity.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P101_S2	As a covered entity subject to HIPAA, we must meet these requirements, and moreover, we must structure and provide our services in a way that supports our clients HIPAA compliance obligations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	The HITECH Act, which became law in February 2009, and the regulations issued and to be issued under it, have provided and are expected to provide, among other things, clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	As these additional requirements are adopted, we will be required to comply with them.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the requirements imposed by the HITECH Act, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P103_S2	For example, the Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulations issued final data security regulations, which became effective in March 2010 and establish minimum standards for protecting and storing personal information about Massachusetts residents contained in paper or electronic format.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	Our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P104_S1	Accordingly, our clients are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P104_S2	During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other healthcare providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P104_S3	It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement future reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement under government programs that adversely affect our client base or our cost of providing our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P104_S4	Any such changes could adversely affect our own financial condition by reducing the reimbursement rates of our clients or by increasing our cost of serving clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	A number of federal and state laws, loosely referred to as fraud and abuse laws, are used to prosecute healthcare providers, physicians, and others that make, offer, seek, or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state healthcare program and, in some instances, any private program.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P105_S1	Given the breadth of these laws and regulations, they are potentially applicable to our business; the transactions that we undertake on behalf of our clients; and the financial arrangements through which we market, sell, and distribute our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to healthcare providers and patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	The federal healthcare programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	Courts have construed this anti-kickback law to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of one of the arrangements is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	There are several limited exclusions known as safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	These safe harbors have very limited application.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	Penalties for federal anti-kickback violations are severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties with triple damages, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	Many states have similar anti-kickback laws, some of which are not limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government healthcare program.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment, for example, by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing for the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P111_S2	These laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P111_S3	For example, one federal false claim law forbids knowing submission to government programs of false claims for reimbursement for medical items or services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P111_S4	Under this law, knowledge may consist of willful ignorance or reckless disregard of falsity.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P111_S5	How these concepts apply to services such as ours that rely substantially on automated processes has not been well defined in the regulations or relevant case law.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P111_S6	As a result, our errors with respect to the formatting, preparation, or transmission of such claims and any mishandling by us of claims information that is supplied by our clients or other third parties may be determined to, or may be alleged to, involve willful ignorance or reckless disregard of any falsity that is later determined to exist.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we charge our clients a percentage of the collections that they receive as a result of our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P112_S1	To the extent that liability under fraud and abuse laws and regulations requires intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P112_S2	CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	In addition to the provisions relating to healthcare access and delivery, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, made changes to healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P113_S1	PPACA expands false claim laws, amends key provisions of other anti-fraud and abuse statutes, provides the government with new enforcement tools and funding for enforcement, and enhances both criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P113_S2	PPACA may result in increased anti-fraud enforcement activities.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	Stark Law and Similar State Laws.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and healthcare entities.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P115_S1	Physicians are prohibited from referring patients for certain designated health services reimbursed under federally funded programs to entities with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, unless such referrals fall within a specific exception.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	civil monetary penalties and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P116_S1	Furthermore, reimbursement claims for care rendered under forbidden referrals may be deemed false or fraudulent, resulting in liability under other fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	Laws in many states similarly forbid billing based on referrals between individuals and/or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P117_S1	These laws vary widely from state to state.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	In many states, there are laws that prohibit non-licensed practitioners from practicing medicine, prevent corporations from being licensed as practitioners, and prohibit licensed medical practitioners from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P118_S1	In some states, these prohibitions take the form of laws or regulations forbidding the splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P118_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	There are also federal and state laws that forbid or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P119_S1	Some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P119_S2	In particular, the Medicare program specifically requires that billing agents who receive Medicare payments on behalf of medical care providers must meet the following requirements:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	in receiving the payment, the agent must act only on behalf of the provider, except insofar as the agent uses part of that payment to compensate the agent for the agent s billing and collection services.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	Medicaid regulations similarly provide that payments may be received by billing agents in the name of their clients without violating anti-assignment requirements if payment to the agent is related to the cost of the billing service, not related on a percentage basis to the amount billed or collected, and not dependent on collection of payment.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	States have differing prescription format and signature requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	Many existing laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the methods of e-commerce now being developed.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S1	However, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S2	In addition, on November 7, 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services published its final E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program regulations, referred to below as the E-Prescribing Regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S3	These regulations are required by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ) and became effective beginning on January 1, 2006.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S4	The E-Prescribing Regulations consist of detailed standards and requirements, in addition to the HIPAA standards discussed previously, for prescription and other information transmitted electronically in connection with a drug benefit covered by the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S5	These standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S6	The standards apply to prescription drug plans participating in the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P123_S7	Aspects of our services are affected by such regulation, as our clients need to comply with these requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	For certain prescriptions that cannot or may not be transmitted electronically from physician to pharmacy, both federal and state laws require that the written forms used exhibit anti-tampering features.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	For example, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 has since April 2008 required that most prescriptions covered by Medicaid must demonstrate security features that prevent copying, erasing, or counterfeiting of the written form.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P124_S2	Because our clients will, on occasion, need to use printed forms, we must take these laws into consideration for purposes of the prescription functions of our athenaClinicals service.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	The HITECH Act directs the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, or ONCHIT, to support and promote meaningful use of certified EHR technology nationwide through the adoption of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria as well as the establishment of certification programs for EHR technology.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P125_S1	In January 2011, HHS issued a final rule to establish a permanent certification program for EHR technology, including how organizations can become ONC-Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies (ONC-ATCBs).
1131096_11_ITEM1_P125_S2	ONC-ATCBs are required to test and certify that EHR technology is compliant with the standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary and meet the definition of certified EHR technology.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P125_S3	In July 2010, the Secretary published the final rule that adopted standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for EHR technology.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P125_S4	Our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR by CCHIT, an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable eligible provider certification criteria adopted by the Secretary.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P126_S0	While we believe our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P127_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices and a proposed rule for reclassification of medical device data systems under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P127_S1	The FDA has stated that health information technology software is a medical device under the FDCA, and we expect that the FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft policy or proposed rule is finalized or changed.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P127_S2	If our computer software functionality is considered medical device under the FDCA, we could be subject to the FDA requirements discussed below.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P128_S1	Under the FDCA, medical devices include any instrument, apparatus, machine, contrivance, or other similar or related article that is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P128_S2	FDA regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and import and export.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P128_S3	FDA requirements with respect to devices that are determined to pose lesser risk to the public include:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P129_S0	post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P130_S0	Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, a recommendation by the FDA to disallow us from entering into government contracts, and criminal prosecutions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P130_S1	The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P131_S0	Our subsidiary in Chennai, India, is subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P131_S1	These regulations include Indian federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws, and qualification for tax status and tax incentives.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P132_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P132_S1	Despite these reliances, we believe the following factors are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage:
1131096_11_ITEM1_P133_S0	a continued focus on the improved financial results of our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P134_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we held two U.S. patents, with twelve U.S. patent applications pending and two foreign patent applications pending.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P134_S1	Our first patent application described and documented our unique patient workflow process, including the Rules Engine, which applies proprietary rules to practice and payer inputs on a live, ongoing basis to produce cleaner healthcare claims, which can be adjudicated more quickly and efficiently.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P134_S2	This patent application was granted in November 2009 and expires in December 2023.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P134_S3	We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P135_S0	We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered service marks to protect our brand.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P135_S1	Our registered service marks include athenaClinicals, athenaCollector, athenaCommunicator, athenahealth, athenaNet, PayerView, and the athenahealth logo.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P135_S2	Anodyne Analytics, Anodyne Intelligence, athenaEnterprise, athenaRules, and ReminderCall are unregistered service marks.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P136_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes the registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks of other persons.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P137_S0	We have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P137_S1	Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P138_S0	potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P138_S1	Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P139_S2	In addition, as further explained in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P140_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had 1,242 full-time employees, with 691 in service operations, 199 in sales and marketing, 211 in research and development, and 141 in general and administrative functions.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P140_S1	Of these full-time employees, 1,142 were located in the U.S. and 100 were located in Chennai, India.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P141_S1	None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	The financial information required under this Item 1 is incorporated herein by reference to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available through the Investors portion of our website ( www.athenahealth.com ) free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P143_S1	Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other securities filings unless specifically incorporated herein by reference.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P143_S2	In addition, our filings with the SEC may be accessed through the SEC s Interactive Data Electronic Applications (IDEA) system at www.sec.gov.
1131096_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	All statements made in any of our securities filings, including all forward-looking statements or information, are made as of the date of the document in which the statement is included, and we do not assume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower than expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer than expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned revenue expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Some of our current competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition to new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target market.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but that offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively against current or future competitors, it may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The market for our services is relatively immature and volatile, and if it does not develop further or if it develops more slowly than we expect, the growth of our business will be harmed.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market for cloud-based business services is still relatively new and narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand business services in general, and for their revenue, clinical and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to an on-demand application service.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, as a relatively new company in the healthcare business services market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P13_S7	If any of these risks occur, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our success depends on providing services that the medical community uses to improve business performance and quality of service to patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients will want.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely basis, we may lose clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The sales cycle for our services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Some of our new-client set-up projects are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In some cases, especially those involving larger clients, the sales cycle and the implementation cycle may exceed the typical ranges by substantial margins.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles require us to defer revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated expected customer life, currently twelve years, or the contract term.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	This could harm our future operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	After a client contract is signed, we provide an implementation process for the client during which appropriate connections and registrations are established and checked, data is loaded into our athenaNet system, data tables are set up, and practice personnel are given initial training.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The length and details of this implementation process vary widely from client to client.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Typically, implementation of larger clients takes longer than implementation for smaller clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Implementation for a given client may be cancelled.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or for no reason in 90 days.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Despite the fact that we typically require a deposit in advance of implementation, some clients have cancelled before our services have been started.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In addition, implementation may be delayed or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If implementation periods are extended, our provision of the revenue cycle, clinical cycle, or patient cycle services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P20_S8	In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the cancelled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	These factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If the revenue of our clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Under most of our client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our physician clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S5	With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government health care programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S6	In addition, both public and private payers may introduce payment reform initiatives, such as capitation or risk-sharing models, as a cost-control measure that would limit the amounts paid to our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Also, although we currently estimate our expected customer life to be twelve years, this is only an estimate and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated on 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may not see the benefits of, or have our services approved under, government programs initiated to counter the effects of the current economic situation or foster the adoption of certain health information technologies, which could reduce client demand or affect our access to the market.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Although government programs have been initiated to counter the effects of the current economic situation and foster the adoption of certain health information technologies, we cannot assure that we will receive any funds from, or have our services approved under, those programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For example, the HITECH Act has authorized approximately $19 billion in expenditures to further adoption of EHRs, and entities such as the Massachusetts Healthcare Consortium have offered to subsidize such adoption, as permitted by recent changes in federal regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If our services are not approved or included as a preferred solution under certain programs, our access to the market could be reduced.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, the Health Information Technology Extension Program under the HITECH Act provides for 70 or more regional centers that will assist local healthcare providers in selecting and using EHR products and services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	While athenaClinicals has been approved, or included in a list of preferred products and services, under a number of programs, failure to obtain such approval or inclusion in one or more additional programs could reduce demand for our services and our access to the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including a material decrease in revenues and possibly market share.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Other relationships permit third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided as well as the channel relationship themselves may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing wrongful or illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Any misconduct by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients, any failure to follow contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in wrongful or illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P33_S4	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and lead analysts or investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, resulting in reduction in the market price of our stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have been experiencing a period of rapid growth.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	To manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P35_S5	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We depend upon two third-party service providers for important processing functions.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If either of these third-party providers does not fulfill its contractual obligations or chooses to discontinue its services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have entered into service agreements with International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our client service operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Among other things, these providers process critical claims data and clinical documents.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If these services fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation, and operating results could be harmed.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Failure of either service provider to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P37_S4	With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves, which increases our risk.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources, and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We conduct operations throughout the world, including the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, and pandemics.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, client satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain clients, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Furthermore, the requirements to expense equity awards may discourage us from granting the size or type of equity awards that job candidates require to join our company.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P42_S8	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	enhance our existing service, enhance our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or as a result of the current condition of the equity and debt markets limited financing may be available, if at all.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P48_S5	If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers, and otherwise harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of, audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	From time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings, and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes, interest, and penalties in amounts that may be material.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States at both the federal and state levels.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In determining our provision for income taxes, we are required to exercise judgment and make estimates where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	While we believe that our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audit or tax-related litigation will not be materially different from that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or our exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our operating results and financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the geographic mix of our revenue, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P59_S4	There can be no assurance, however, that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Additionally, due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The results of our review of our revenue recognition practices and resulting restatement may continue to have adverse effects on our financial results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our review of our revenue recognition practices and our restatement of our historical financial statements through September 30, 2009, resulted in the deferral of previously recognized revenue and required and may in the future require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal, and other expenses, all of which may have an adverse effect on our financial results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	For example, actions may be brought against us or our current or former officers relating to a failure to apply generally accepted accounting principles in the reporting of quarterly and annual financial statements and securities prospectuses from the time of our initial public offering to our filing with the SEC on March 15, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	On March 19, 2010, one such action was filed against us and certain of our current and former officers in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging violation of the federal securities laws by dissemination of false and misleading statements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	For additional information regarding this litigation, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and the trading price for our securities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Litigation would be time-consuming, expensive, and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P62_S5	The defense of any litigation would result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P62_S6	In addition, while we maintain standard directors and officers insurance, all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these claims may not be covered by insurance.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We cannot be certain that the measures we have taken that address this restatement will ensure that restatements will not occur in the future.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Execution of restatements like the one described above could create a significant strain on our internal resources, cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results, increase our costs, and cause management distraction.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent, and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, noncompetition, and assignment of inventions agreements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	While we have two issued U.S. patent and have twelve more U.S. patent applications and two foreign patent applications pending as of December 31, 2010, we may be unable to obtain further meaningful patent protection for our technology.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Further, our platform incorporates open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P68_S3	While we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses, and therefore the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could materially harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S3	For example, a complaint was recently filed by Prompt Medical Systems, L.P. naming us and several other defendants alleging infringement of its patent with a listed issue date in 1996 entitled Method for Computing Current Procedural Terminology Codes from Physician Generated Documentation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S4	For additional information regarding this litigation, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S6	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P71_S7	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P72_S3	In addition, we may be required to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling for such a claim.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our loan and capital lease agreements contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We have loan and capital lease agreements with $9.2 million outstanding at December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our loan agreements restrict our ability to:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	consolidate or merge with other entities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In addition, our credit facilities require us to meet specified minimum financial measurements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in these credit facilities, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities, or expand or fully pursue our business strategies.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Our loan agreements also contain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants, including limitations on our consolidated leverage ratio and capital expenditures, as well as defaults relating to non-payment, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, default under other indebtedness (including a cross-default with our interest rate swap), bankruptcy and insolvency, inability to pay debts, attachment of assets, adverse judgments, ERISA violations, invalidity of loan and collateral documents, and change of control.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P77_S4	A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under either or both of the loan agreements, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under both credit facilities to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We have entered into a derivative contract with a financial counterparty, the effectiveness of which is dependent on the continued viability of this financial counterparty, and its nonperformance could harm our financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We have entered into an interest rate swap contract as part of our strategy to mitigate risks related to fluctuations in cash flow from movement in interest rates.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The effectiveness of our hedging programs using this instrument is dependent, in part, upon the counterparty to this contract honoring its financial obligations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The recent upheaval in the capital markets has caused the viability of certain counterparties to be questioned.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	While we have not experienced any losses due to counterparty nonperformance, if our counterparty is unable to perform its obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may incur additional costs as a result of continuing to operate as a public company, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and greater expenditures may be necessary in the future with the advent of new laws and regulations pertaining to public companies.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our management and other personnel continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives, and additional laws and regulations may divert further management resources.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of new compliance initiatives in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P84_S2	It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including patients of our physician clients, government agencies, or stockholders.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P86_S2	For example, on March 19, 2010, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed against us and certain of our current and former officers in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging violation of the federal securities laws by dissemination of false and misleading statements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P86_S3	For additional information regarding this litigation, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P87_S2	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary athenaNet application from operating properly.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P89_S2	If athenaNet does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us and/or attempt to cancel their contracts with us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P89_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Moreover, information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S1	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Errors may result from receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information or from interface of our services with legacy systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Because changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S5	These defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to clients or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S6	Defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P90_S7	Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	In addition, clients relying on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We market and sell services that, among other things, provide information to assist care providers in tracking and treating ill patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby harm our business and operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our clients or their patients may assert claims against us alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our software or service processes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P94_S1	A product liability claim or errors or omissions claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such a claim.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	If our security measures are breached or fail, and unauthorized access is obtained to a client s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our services involve the storage and transmission of clients proprietary information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P96_S2	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client or patient data.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P96_S3	As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We rely upon our clients as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	On occasion, our clients have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Failure of clients to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P97_S3	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P97_S4	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P97_S5	In addition, our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their client data or the data of their patients on our systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P97_S6	Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P99_S1	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P99_S2	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P99_S3	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P99_S4	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P99_S5	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Various events could interrupt clients access to athenaNet, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The ability to access athenaNet is critical to our clients administering care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our own systems or in other systems; and (iv) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our own systems and in other systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P101_S2	We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P101_S3	If clients access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P101_S4	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P101_S5	Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our services, which would adversely impact our revenues.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	In addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data-hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We currently serve our clients from a third-party data-hosting facility located in Bedford, Massachusetts, operated by Digital 55 Middlesex, LLC (as successor to Sentinel Properties-Bedford, LLC).
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P104_S1	In addition, in December 2009 we signed a contract with a major provider of disaster recovery services, SunGard Availability Services, LP, to store our disaster recovery plans, deepen the resiliency of our technology recovery infrastructure, and provide disaster recovery testing services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P104_S2	In the case of a significant event at our primary data center, we could become operational in a reasonable timeframe at our backup data center.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	However, we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P105_S1	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our ability to deliver our Internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P107_S1	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone, facsimile, and pager systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P108_S1	However, we have experienced and expect that we will in the future experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P109_S0	vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P109_S1	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P109_S2	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P109_S3	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P110_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P111_S2	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P112_S1	The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P112_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including database software from Oracle Corporation and storage devices from International Business Machines Corporation and EMC Corporation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P114_S1	These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms; however, it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P116_S1	While we have implemented certain features and safeguards designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P117_S0	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Our software, content, and services are used to assist clinical decision-making and provide information about patient medical histories and treatment plans.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P118_S1	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our proprietary athenaClinicals service is utilized in clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P119_S1	If our athenaClinicals service fails to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of that service is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, clinicians, or patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P120_S0	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P120_S1	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages and to require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P120_S2	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P121_S0	We maintain general liability and insurance coverage, but this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P121_S1	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P121_S2	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Our proprietary software may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P122_S1	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P122_S2	From time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software, and such defects or errors can be expected to appear in the future.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P122_S3	Defects and errors that are not timely detected and remedied could expose us to risk of liability to clients, clinicians, and patients and cause delays in introduction of new services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, or decrease market acceptance or client satisfaction with our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P123_S0	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P124_S0	We may be liable for use of incorrect or incomplete data that we provide, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P125_S0	We store and display data for use by healthcare providers in treating patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P125_S1	Our clients or third parties provide us with most of these data.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P125_S2	If these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P125_S3	In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P125_S4	While we maintain insurance coverage, we cannot assure that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P125_S5	Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P125_S6	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P127_S0	The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P128_S1	In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P128_S2	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P128_S3	Some of the risks we face from healthcare regulation are described below:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P129_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P129_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P129_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P129_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P129_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P130_S0	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P130_S1	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P130_S2	The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P131_S0	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P131_S1	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P131_S2	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to our clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P132_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P133_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P133_S1	In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P133_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P133_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P133_S4	In addition, our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P134_S0	access by the Department of Health and Human Services to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P135_S0	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P135_S1	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P135_S2	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it have provided and are expected to provide clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P135_S3	In addition, ONCHIT is coordinating the ongoing development of national standards for creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the healthcare sector.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P135_S4	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P136_S0	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P136_S1	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, we seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P137_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P137_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our clients, and since we do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P138_S0	Among our services, we provide telephone reminder services to patients, Internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P138_S1	We believe that reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure of individually identifiable health information have been and are being taken in connection with these services, including the use of multiple-password security.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P138_S2	However, any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P139_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P139_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P140_S1	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P142_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to healthcare providers and patients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P142_S1	For example, the federal healthcare programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P142_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P142_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws forbid bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P142_S4	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients, vendors, or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P142_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P143_S0	There are federal and state laws that forbid payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals and/or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with health care providers.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P143_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P143_S2	These vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal laws called the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P143_S3	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P143_S4	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P143_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P145_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P145_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P145_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P145_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P145_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P146_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P146_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P146_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P146_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P147_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P147_S1	States have differing prescription format requirements, and, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P147_S2	Regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P147_S3	Any determination that we or our clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P147_S4	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P148_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P148_S1	As a company that provides EHR functionality, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P148_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P148_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P149_S0	The software component of our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR by CCHIT, an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P149_S1	The 2011/2012 criteria support the Stage 1 meaningful use measures required to qualify eligible providers and hospitals for funding under the HITECH Act.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P149_S2	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P150_S0	While we believe that our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of our client s claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P152_S0	Federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P152_S1	Although we do not determine what is billed to a payer, to the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for healthcare services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P153_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P153_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P153_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and timeframes may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P153_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by clients.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P154_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P154_S1	To the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P155_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P156_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P156_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P157_S0	Potential healthcare reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new services types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Our services may be significantly impacted by healthcare reform initiatives and are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, either of which could affect our business in a multitude of ways.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P158_S1	If substantive healthcare reform or applicable regulatory requirements are adopted, we may have to change or adapt our services and software to comply.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P158_S2	Reform or changing regulatory requirements may render our services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P158_S3	This may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop services or software.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P158_S4	It may also make introduction of new service types more costly or more time consuming than we currently anticipate.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P158_S5	Such changes may even prevent introduction by us of new services or make the continuation of our existing services unprofitable or impossible.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P161_S0	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and customer service providers, International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P161_S2	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P162_S0	Changes in the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P163_S0	As the healthcare industry evolves, changes in our client and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P163_S1	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of healthcare providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P163_S2	Such larger healthcare organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P163_S3	Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P163_S4	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P164_S0	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P165_S0	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P165_S1	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P165_S2	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P166_S0	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P167_S0	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and/or credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P167_S1	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P167_S2	If any of our employees or subcontractors takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P167_S3	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P168_S0	Potential subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P169_S0	Recently, entities such as the Massachusetts Healthcare Consortium have offered to subsidize adoption by physicians of EHR technology.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P169_S1	In addition, federal regulations have been changed to permit such subsidy from additional sources subject to certain limitations, and the current administration has passed the HITECH Act, which will provide federal support for EHR initiatives.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P169_S2	To the extent that we do not qualify or participate in such subsidy programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P170_S0	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P171_S0	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P171_S1	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P172_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P172_S1	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P172_S2	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P173_S0	If a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P174_S0	If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P174_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 34.5 million shares of common stock outstanding.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P174_S2	Moreover, the holders of shares of common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P175_S0	We have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our 1997 Stock Plan, 2000 Stock Plan, 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P175_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding options to purchase approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock (approximately 1.6 million of which were exercisable at December 31, 2010) that, if exercised, will result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P175_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding restricted stock units totaling approximately 0.3 million that, if vested, will result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P175_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P176_S0	Actual or potential sales of our stock by our employees, including members of our senior management team, pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons, and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P177_S0	In accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and our policies regarding stock transactions, a number of our directors and employees, including members of our senior management team, have adopted and will continue to adopt pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell a portion of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P177_S1	Generally, stock sales under such plans by members of our senior management team and directors require public filings.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P177_S2	Actual or potential sales of our stock by such persons could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P177_S3	For example, a substantial amount of our common stock becoming available (or being perceived to become available) for sale in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent it from increasing.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P177_S4	Also, actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P178_S0	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P179_S0	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P179_S1	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.

1131096_11_ITEM1A_P181_S0	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P181_S1	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P182_S0	board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P183_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally an entity that, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P184_S0	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P184_S1	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P185_S0	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P186_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P186_S1	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P186_S2	Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_11_ITEM1A_P186_S3	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.
1131096_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we own a complex of buildings, including approximately 133,000 square feet of office space, on approximately 53 acres of land in Belfast, Maine.

1131096_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	No. 5,483,443 with a listed issue date of January 9, 1996, entitled Method for Computing Current Procedural Terminology Codes from Physician Generated Documentation.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint seeks an injunction enjoining infringement, damages, and pre- and post-judgment costs and interest.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company and other several defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	On February 11, 2011, the Court issued an Order granting-in-part and denying-in-part the motions to dismiss.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	The Court ordered the plaintiff to replead certain claims within fourteen days of the Order.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	On November 24, 2010, several defendants filed (i) a motion for summary judgment of invalidity against the patent-in-suit on the basis that it claims only non-patentable subject matter; and (ii) a motion to stay all proceedings pending the resolution of the motion for summary judgment.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company filed a motion to join in the motion to stay the proceedings.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	The motions are fully briefed and awaiting a decision by the Court.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	The case is currently in the discovery phase.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	A claim construction hearing is scheduled for November 11, 2011.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	Trial is scheduled for June 11, 2012.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	The Company is being indemnified in this lawsuit from and against any liability and reasonable costs, including attorneys fees, incurred by the Company in its defense, pursuant to a license agreement with its vendor.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the lawsuit and continues to contest it vigorously.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	On March 19, 2010, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company and certain of its current and former officers entitled Casula v. athenahealth, Inc. et al , Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-10477.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P6_S1	On June 3, 2010, the court appointed Waterford Township General Employees Retirement System as the lead plaintiff.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P6_S2	On August 2, 2010, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P6_S3	The amended complaint alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by disseminating false and misleading statements through press releases, statements by senior management, and SEC filings.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P6_S4	The alleged false and misleading statements concern, among other things, the amortization period for deferred implementation revenues.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P6_S5	The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs, and expenses.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P6_S6	The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on October 1, 2010, and a reply brief in further support of the motion to dismiss the amended complaint on December 30, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the amended complaint, and we will contest the claims vigorously.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	In addition, from time to time we may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1131096_11_ITEM3_P8_S1	We do not, however, currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

1131096_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 16, 2011, was $47.55 per share.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	As of February 16, 2011, we had 146 holders of record of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P2_S2	Because many shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock, and our loan agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P3_S2	Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	Set forth below is a graph comparing the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the NASDAQ Composite-Total Returns Index and the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Index for the period starting with our initial public offering on September 20, 2007, through the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	The graph assumes an investment of $100.00 made at the closing of trading on September 20, 2007, in each of (i) our common stock, (ii) the stocks comprising the NASDAQ Composite-Total Returns Index, and (iii) stocks comprising the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Index.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	All values assume reinvestment of the full amount of all dividends, if any, into additional shares of the same class of equity securities at the frequency with which dividends are paid on such securities during the applicable time period.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	We registered shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	Our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-143998) in connection with our initial public offering was declared effective by the SEC on September 20, 2007.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P6_S2	The offering commenced as of September 25, 2007, and did not terminate before all securities were sold.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P6_S3	The offering was co-managed by the underwriters Goldman, Sachs Co; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith, Incorporated; Piper Jaffray Co.; and Jefferies Company, Inc.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	of the underwriters over-allotment option, at a price to the public of $18.00 per share.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P7_S1	The offering closed on September 25, 2007, and we received net proceeds of approximately $81.3 million (after underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately $6.3 million and additional offering-related costs of approximately $2.4 million).
1131096_11_ITEM5_P7_S2	No underwriting discounts and commissions or offering expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities or to any other affiliates.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b).
1131096_11_ITEM5_P8_S1	We expect to use the remaining net proceeds for capital expenditures, working capital, and other general corporate purposes.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P8_S2	We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, or technologies or to fund expansion of our operations facilities.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P8_S3	However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	Pending the uses described above, we have invested the net proceeds in a variety of short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $35.9 million invested in cash and cash equivalents and $80.2 million in short-term investments.
1131096_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, there were no purchases made by us, on our behalf, or by any affiliated purchasers of shares of our common stock.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables summarize our consolidated financial data for the periods presented.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	You should read the following financial information together with the information under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to these consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2008, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer needed on its deferred tax assets.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	Accordingly, the 2008 results include the reversal of a $23.9 million valuation allowance.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Change in accounting principle Effective January 1, 2006, freestanding warrants and other similar instruments related to shares that are redeemable are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	Under this guiadance, freestanding warrants exercisable for shares of the Company s redeemable convertible preferred stock are classified as a warrant liability on the Company s balance sheet.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	The warrants issued for the purchase of the Company s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock are subject to the provisions of this guidance.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P2_S3	The Company accounted for the adoption of this guidance as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $373 recorded on January 1, 2006, the date of the Company s adoption of this guidance.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P2_S4	The cumulative effect adjustment was calculated as the difference in the fair value of the warrants from the historical carrying value as of January 1, 2006.
1131096_11_ITEM6_P2_S5	The original carrying value of the warrants, $1,229, was reclassified to liabilities from additional paid-in capital at the date of adoption.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes to these financial statements, and the other financial information that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

1131096_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.

1131096_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	athenahealth provides business services that help medical practices achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more money and exercising more control over their administrative tasks.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	These services are designed to reduce the administrative burden of complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication, and many of the related tasks that distract medical providers and staff from the practice of medicine.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud-based platform, athenaNet.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	We differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements through athenaNet to clients without any action on the part of the client.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	athenaNet enables us to quickly implement our solution at a low up-front cost and to seamlessly work in tandem with our clients in real time.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The services provided through our single-instance cloud are currently packaged as three integrated components: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management, athenaClinicals for clinical cycle management, and athenaCommunicator for patient cycle management.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The use of our single-instance platform allows all clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of all of our other clients through our patented billing Rules Engine and our clinical Quality Management Engine.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our clients use these rules engines to monitor and benchmark their performance with peer practices across the network.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our business intelligence application, Anodyne Analytics, also supports our clients in their pursuit of financial health by equipping users with data visualization tools and insight into their practice s performance.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct components: Software, Knowledge, and Work.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	The cloud-based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients, payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Knowledge is infused into each of our services via our Rules Engine as we work with clients, payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The third component to each of our services is the Work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Wherever possible, we replace manual processes with automation, but where automation is not possible, we provide that manual labor rather than returning it to clients to be completed.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	This unique service model of Software, Knowledge, and Work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance, creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	We charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases, so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	In 2010, we generated revenue of $245.5 million from the sale of our services compared to $188.5 million in 2009 and $136.3 million in 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Despite increased spending in these areas, higher revenue and lower direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue have led to greater operating income.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our revenues are predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	This revenue is generally determined as a percentage of our clients collections, so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians working within our client accounts and the collections of these physicians.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	To provide these services, we incur expense in several categories, including direct operating, selling and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	In general, our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	Our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future, our overall business management activities, and our infrastructure.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity, in adherence to related financial covenants.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We derive our revenue from two sources: from business services which are primarily associated with our revenue, clinical and patient cycle management services and from implementation and other services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Implementation and other services consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Business services accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	Business services fees are typically 2% to 8% of a practice s total collections depending upon the services used and the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice, plus a per-statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients of certain clients.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	Accordingly, business services fees are largely driven by: the number of physician practices we serve, the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians and other medical providers, the services used by the practice and our contracted rates.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	None of our clients accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, or 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits, claim processing costs, other direct costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients, including staff who implement new clients.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future, the direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenues as we further increase the percentage of transactions that are resolved on the first attempt and as we decrease the cost of implementation for new clients.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	In addition, over the longer term, we expect to increase our overall level of automation and to reduce our direct operating expense as a percentage of revenues as we become a larger operation, with higher volumes of work in particular functions, geographies, and medical specialties.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	Included in direct operating expense are the service costs associated with our athenaClinicals offering, which includes transaction handling related to lab requisitions, lab results entry, fax classification, and other services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S5	We have also included in direct operating expense the service costs associated with our athenaCommunicator offering, which includes costs based on telephone call volume, live operator answering services, software licenses, and other services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S6	We also expect these costs to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to decline as a percentage of revenue.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P12_S7	This decrease will be driven by increased levels of automation and by economies of scale.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, depreciation, and amortization, except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and on-line initiatives) and personnel-related expense for sales and marketing employees (including salaries, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expense).
1131096_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	We also plan to expand our marketing activities in certain areas, such as attending trade shows, expanding user groups, and creating new printed materials as well as expand our external channel partner through the addition of new key strategic partners.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P14_S5	As a result, we expect that, in the future, sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute terms and will likely remain at current levels as a percentage of total revenue in the near term.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses for research and development employees (including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expense) and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We expect that, in the future, research and development expense will increase in absolute terms but not as a percentage of total revenue as new services and more mature products require incrementally less new research and development investment.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees (including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expense), occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), and insurance, as well as software license fees; outside professional fees for accountants, lawyers, and consultants; and compensation for temporary employees.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth and incur additional expense related to being a publicly traded company.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenues.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development costs, which we amortize over a two-year period from the time of release of related software code.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Cost for our revenue cycle application are considered maintenance and we expense those costs as incurred, and, as a result, in 2010 approximately 83% of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	In the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 85% and 87%, respectively, were expensed rather than capitalized.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	As we grow, we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business, and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	Therefore, we expect related depreciation and amortization expense to increase in absolute terms and increase as a percentage of total revenue in the near term.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our equipment-related term leases, our term loan and revolving loans under our credit facility, and our former subordinated term loan, offset by interest income on investments.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Interest income represents earnings from our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	The gain or loss on interest rate derivative contract represents the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that is not designated a hedge under the authoritative accounting guidance.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Although this derivative has not been designated for hedge accounting, we believe that such instrument is correlated with the underlying cash flow exposure related to variability in interest rate movements on our term loan.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	In October 2009, we acquired Anodyne Health Partners, Inc., a Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS ) business intelligence company based in Alpharetta, Georgia.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	We believe that the acquisition of Anodyne provides us with expanded service offerings that will better enable us to compete in the large medical group and enterprise markets.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Anodyne SaaS business intelligence tool enhances customers ability to view all facets of its revenue cycle information and to access and extract critical operational and administrative information from various data systems.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Consideration for this transaction was $22.3 million plus potential additional consideration of $7.7 million which will be paid over a three-year period if Anodyne achieves certain business and financial milestones.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we have paid $0.2 million of the additional consideration.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	In September 2008, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of Crest Line Technologies, LLC (d.b.a. MedicalMessaging.net).
1131096_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	MedicalMessaging provided live and automated calling services for healthcare professionals.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The purpose of the acquisition is to augment our core business service offering with MedicalMessaging s automated and live communication services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	MedicalMessaging gave us access to a developed technology that could speed the time to market versus internal development of our own similar product.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	In addition, we plan to leverage its existing customer base to increase revenues of the MedicalMessaging services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Consideration for this transaction was $7.7 million including potential additional consideration of $1.0 million which will be paid over a three-year period if MedicalMessaging achieves certain financial milestones.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we have paid $0.7 million of the additional consideration.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
1131096_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including our estimated expected customer life; (2) allowance for doubtful accounts; (3) asset impairments; (4) depreciable lives of assets; (5) economic lives and fair value of leased assets; (6) income tax reserves; (7) fair value of stock options; (8) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (9) fair value of contingent consideration; and (10) litigation reserves.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Actual results could differ from the estimates we have used.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	We derive our revenue from business services associated with our revenue cycle, clinical cycle, patient cycle, and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	All revenue, other than implementation revenue, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers; we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	As the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services, we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete, at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the longer of the estimated expected customer life or contract life.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that renew automatically upon completion.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenaNet, minimum fees, flat fees, or per-claim fees where applicable.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the month and delivered to clients primarily by email.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	For most of our clients, fees are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts, the aging of accounts receivable, and other economic information on both an historical and prospective basis.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	There are no off-balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	We are required to recognize our non-refundable up-front fees over the contract term or estimated expected customer life, whichever is longer.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	We considered all factors in the authoritative accounting literature and specifically focused on the following three factors in determining the estimated customer life:
1131096_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our estimate of expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	For example, if in the future, we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	On the other hand, if in the future, we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The amount of deferred revenue related to non-refundable up-front fees is $40.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	In the quarter when a customer terminates, any unrecognized service fees associated with implementation services before and after services have been started are recognized as revenue in that quarter.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	Deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carry forwards.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	A high degree of judgment is required to determine if, and the extent to which, valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Contingent tax liabilities are based on our assessment of the likelihood that we have incurred a liability.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Such liabilities are reviewed based on recent changes in tax laws and regulations, including judicial rulings.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	In addition, we are required to establish reserves for tax contingencies.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We grant various nonqualified stock-based compensation awards, including stock options and restricted stock units.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The share-based compensation expense and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year 2010 was $14.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	As of December 31, 2010, there was $34.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized through 2014.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	We estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires us to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	we have not had sufficient history as a publicly traded company to evaluate its volatility factor and expected term.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	As such, we analyzed the volatilities and expected terms of a group of peer companies to support the assumptions used in its calculations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	We averaged the volatilities of the peer companies with in-the-money options, sufficient trading history and similar vesting terms to generate the assumptions detailed above.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	We have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	In addition, we are required to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	We estimate the fair value of the restricted stock units using the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We believe that there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation under the authoritative guidance.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the authoritative guidance in future periods than those currently, the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have historically reported for future grants.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	If the volatility percentage used in calculating our stock compensation expense had fluctuated by 10%, the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four-year vesting period would have increased or decreased by approximately $3 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	If the forfeiture rate used in calculating our stock compensation expense had fluctuated by 10%, the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four-year vesting period would have decreased or increased by approximately $1 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Software development costs for internal use are expensed or capitalized based on the stage of development for the software and are amortized over the estimated economic life of the software releases.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Under this guidance, costs related to the preliminary project stage of subsequent versions of athenaNet and/or other technology are expensed as incurred.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Costs incurred in the application development stage are capitalized.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Such costs are amortized over the software s estimated economic life of two years.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	In 2010, approximately 83% of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized, based upon the stage of development of the software.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	In the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 85% of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	In the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 87% of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in software development costs that could be material.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Contingent consideration in a business combination after January 1, 2009, is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, changes in the assumed timing and amount of revenue and expense estimates.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	We recorded potential contingent consideration of $7.7 million in the initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of $5.1 million related to the Anodyne Health Partners, Inc acquisition in October 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	The change in the assumptions, and other factors, resulted in a decrease of $0.3 million in the fair value of the total contingent consideration during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company paid $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, under the terms of the second potential contingent consideration.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The balance as of December 31, 2010, was $4.7 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods shown:
1131096_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $245.5 million, an increase of $57.0 million, or 30%, over revenue of $188.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	This increase was due almost entirely to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Revenue from business services for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $237.1 million, an increase of $53.9 million, or 29%, over revenue of $183.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	This increase was primarily due to the growth in the number of physicians and other medical providers using our services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	The summary of changes in the physicians and active medical providers using our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, clinical cycle management service, athenaClinicals, and patient cycle management service, athenaCommunicator are as follows:
1131096_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and medical providers.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Total collections generated by these physicians and other medical providers that were posted for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $5.9 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion over posted collections of $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Revenue from implementations and other sources was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.1 million, or 58%, over revenue of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	This increase was driven by new client implementations and increased professional services for our larger client base.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the number of accounts live on our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, was 2,002, an increase of 410 accounts, from 1,592 accounts at December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the numbers of accounts live on our clinical cycle management service, athenaClinicals, was 552, an increase of 302 accounts, from 250 accounts at December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P65_S4	The increase in implementation and other revenue is the result of the increase in the volume of our business.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $96.6 million, an increase of $17.6 million, or 22%, over direct operating costs of $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	on behalf of our clients and the related expense of providing services, including transactions expense and salary and benefits expense.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The amount of collections processed for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $5.9 billion, which was $1.0 billion higher than the $4.9 billion of collection processed for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	The increase in collections increased at a higher rate than the increase in the related direct operating expense as we benefited from economies of scale.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	Direct operating employee-related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, increased $4.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2009, to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P67_S4	This increase is primarily due to the 19% increase in headcount since December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P67_S5	We increased the professional services headcount as part of our redesign of our client services organization and to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base has expanded and includes larger medical groups.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, direct operating expense includes $1.8 million of amortization of purchased intangibles expense related to the purchase of certain assets through acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2008, compared to $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	Stock-based compensation expense also increased $0.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2009, to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Selling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $52.7 million, an increase of $18.6 million, or 55%, over costs of $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	This increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million and an increase in employee-related costs, internal sales commissions and external partner channel commission of $11.2 million due to an increase in headcount and external channel partners.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	Our sales and marketing headcount increased by 62% since December 31, 2009, as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	The increase was also due to a $6.0 million increase in travel related expenses, consulting and other software licenses, online marketing, offline marketing and other marketing events.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $18.4 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 29%, over research and development expense of $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	This increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	Our research and development headcount increased 19% since December 31, 2009, as we hired additional research and development personnel in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $43.1 million, an increase of $7.0 million, or 19%, over general and administrative expenses of $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	This increase was partially due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million, a $1.1 million increase in facilities related expenses, and a $0.7 million increase in bad debt expense.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	Our general and administrative headcount increased by 6% since December 31, 2009, as we added personnel to support our growth.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	Legal, audit, insurance and consulting expenses increased $2.4 million primarily due to our restatement and other additional costs of being a public company.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P71_S4	Additionally, under new authoritative guidance on business combinations adopted January 1, 2009, any changes in the fair value of contingent consideration after the acquisition date affect earnings.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P71_S5	The potential contingent consideration of $7.7 million was recorded in the initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of $5.1 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	The contingent consideration will be adjusted to fair value to the amount payable when, and if, earned.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The difference between the estimated and earn-out amount will be charged or credited to expense.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately $0.3 million was credited to expense relating to this contingent consideration and $0.2 million was paid during the year.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $11.1 million, an increase of $3.4 million, or 43%, from depreciation and amortization of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation from fixed asset expenditures in 2010 and 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million from interest income of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	The decrease was directly related to the lower interest rates during the year.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $0.8 million, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million compared to interest expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	The decrease is related to a decrease in the balance outstanding on our capital leases during 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S4	The loss on interest rate derivative for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $0.2 million, compared to a gain on interest rate derivative for the year ended December 31, 2009, of $0.6 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S5	The loss was the result of the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that was not designated as a hedge instrument under the authoritative guidance.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S6	Although this derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that the instrument is closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus managing the associated risk.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P74_S7	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	We recorded a provision of $10.4 million for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, based upon an effective tax rate of 45% compared to a provision of $8.8 million for the income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009, based upon an effective tax rate of 49%.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to a decrease in our state tax rate and a decrease in the effect of our permanent differences as percent of the overall rate.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	The difference between our statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate is due to permanent differences mostly driven by stock-based compensation expense for incentive stock options.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $188.5 million, an increase of $52.2 million, or 38%, over revenue of $136.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	This increase was due almost entirely to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Revenue from business services for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $183.2 million, an increase of $51.4 million, or 39%, over revenue of $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	This increase was primarily due to the growth in the number of physicians and other medical providers using our services.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	The number of physicians using our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, at December 31, 2009, was 15,719, an increase of 3,130, or 25%, from 12,589 physicians at December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	The number of active medical providers using our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, at December 31, 2009, was 23,366, an increase of 4,598, or 24%, from 18,768 active medical providers at December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S4	The number of physicians using our clinical cycle management service, athenaClinicals, at December 31, 2009, was 920, an increase of 435, or 90%, from 485 physicians at December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S5	The number of active medical providers using our clinical cycle management service, athenaClinicals, at December 31, 2009, was 1,471, an increase of 673, or 84%, from 798 active medical providers at December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S6	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and medical providers.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P77_S7	Total collections generated by these physicians and other medical providers that was posted for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $4.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 32%, over posted collections of $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Revenue from implementations and other sources was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $0.9 million, or 20%, over revenue of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	This increase was driven by new client implementations and increased professional services for our larger client base.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	As of December 31, 2009, the numbers of accounts live on our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, increased by 366 accounts since December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	As of December 31, 2009, the numbers of accounts live on our clinical cycle management service, athenaClinicals, increased by 116 accounts since December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P78_S4	The increase in implementation and other revenue is the result of the increase in the volume of our business.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $79.0 million, an increase of $19 million, or 32%, over direct operating costs of $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients and the related expense of providing services, including transactions expense and salary and benefits expense.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	The amount of collections processed for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $4.9 billion, which was $1.2 billion, or 32% higher than the $3.7 billion of collection processed for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	The increase in collections increased at a higher rate than the increase in the related direct operating expense as we benefited from economies of scale.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Selling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $34.1 million, an increase of $11.3 million, or 49%, over costs of $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	This increase was primarily due to increases in external commissions of $1.5 million, a $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and an increase in salaries, internal commissions and benefits of $4.9 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	expenses totaling $3.3 million, a $0.5 million increase in travel related expense, and a $0.4 million increase in consulting costs.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $14.3 million, an increase of $3.7 million, or 35%, over research and development expense of $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	This increase was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in salaries and benefits.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $36.1 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 23%, over general and administrative expenses of $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	This increase was primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount, a $1.4 million increase in stock compensation expense, and a $1.0 million increase in audit-related and legal fees due to the costs of being a public company and acquisition related costs.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	The remaining portion of the increase relates to an increase in our bad debt expense.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $7.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 30%, from depreciation and amortization of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	This increase was primarily due to the addition of assets during 2009 and 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $1.0 million, a decrease of $0.9 million from interest income of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	The decrease was directly related to the lower interest rates during the year.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $1.0 million, an increase of approximately $0.6 million over interest expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	The increase is related to an increase in the balance outstanding on our capital leases during 2009 and a full year of interest expense relating to our term and revolving loans.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S4	The loss on interest rate derivative for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $0.9 million, compared to a gain on interest rate derivative for the year ended December 31, 2009, of $0.6 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S5	The gain was the result of the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that was not designated a hedge instrument under the authoritative guidance.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S6	Although this derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that the instrument is closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus managing the associated risk.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P85_S7	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	We recorded a provision of $8.8 million for the income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009, based upon an effective tax rate of 49%.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	We recorded a benefit of $23.2 million for income taxes for the period of December 31, 2008, which included a reversal of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of the Company.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	We consider whether a valuation allowance is needed on its deferred tax assets by evaluating all positive and negative evidence relative to its ability to recover deferred tax assets.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Prior to the year ended December 31, 2008, we had incurred losses and it is difficult to assert that deferred tax assets are recoverable with this negative evidence.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2008, our results of operations generated a cumulative profit as measured over the current and prior two years.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition, we had been profitable for six consecutive quarters before releasing the allowance.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	weight of positive and negative evidence, including forecasted operating results, we concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence that our deferred tax assets were more likely than not recoverable as of December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	Accordingly, the remaining valuation allowance was reversed as of December 31, 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Since our inception, we have funded our growth primarily through the private sale of equity securities, totaling approximately $50.6 million, as well as through long-term debt, working capital, equipment-financing loans, and, in September 2007, we completed our initial public offering which provided net proceeds of approximately $81.3 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $116.2 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our cash investments consist of corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, and commercial paper.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	As specified in our investment policy, we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, the policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal, maintaining adequate liquidity at all times, and maximizing returns.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our total indebtedness was $9.2 million at December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	We have an unused revolving credit facility in the amount of $15 million.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	The credit facility may be extended by up to an additional $15 million on the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	There was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility during 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S4	The credit facility expires on September 30, 2011.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S5	We are currently evaluating our options relating to our credit facilities.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S6	In addition, we have a term loan facility used for general working capital needs.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S7	At December 31, 2010, we have $5.3 million outstanding on the term facility.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S8	The term facility matures on September 30, 2013.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S9	At December 31, 2010, there was a net present value of $3.9 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under a series of capital leases with one finance company.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P91_S10	Each of the leases are payable on a monthly basis through December 2012.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	The credit facility and term loan facility contains certain financial and nonfinancial covenants, including limitations on our consolidated leverage ratio and capital expenditures, defaults relating to non-payment, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, default under other indebtedness (including a cross-default with our interest rate swap), bankruptcy and insolvency, inability to pay debts, attachment of assets, adverse judgments, ERISA violations, invalidity of loan and collateral documents, and change of control.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	Upon an event of default, the lenders may terminate the commitment to make loans and the obligation to extend letters of credit, declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and interest accrued under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, require us to provide cash and deposit account collateral for our letter of credit obligations, and exercise their security interests and other rights under the Credit Agreement.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants under this agreement.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to finance our strategic initiatives, make payments on our contractual obligations, and our purchases of property and equipment for at least the next twelve months.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	Our analysis is supported by the growth in our new customer base and a high rate of renewal rates with our existing customers and the corresponding increase in billings and collections.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	In addition, we may pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies, in which case we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facility or obtain additional financing.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	We had no material purchase commitments of capital assets at December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	We currently anticipate our aggregate capital expenditures to be approximately $17 million to $20 million for the next twelve months.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the year 2011.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Historically, there has been no material losses related to such guarantees.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Cash flow from operations increased by $12.4 million to $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	The increase is mainly attributable to increases in net income, add-backs of non-cash expense items, and increases in our changes in operating assets and liabilities.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	The increase in net income is primarily due to the growth in our customer base, stability in renewal rates with our existing customer base, the associated increase in billings and collections, and selling additional services into our existing customer base.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	These increases are partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries, higher commissions, direct operating expenses, and marketing expenses.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S4	These expenses increased in absolute terms but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S5	The increase in add-backs of non-cash expenses during 2010 are primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and our provision for uncollectible accounts.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S6	The increases are off-set by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based awards and a decrease in our deferred income taxes.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S7	The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributed to capital expenditures of $15.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, and a full-year of the amortization of intangibles assets purchased in our acquisition of Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. in October of 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S8	The increase in stock-based compensation expense is primarily due to the increase in the volume and the value of stock-based awards granted during 2010 over grants in 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S9	The decrease in deferred income taxes was mainly attributable to our use of Federal and State NOLs.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S10	The increase to our changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2010 were due primarily to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a smaller increase in accounts receivable.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S11	The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets is mainly attributable to purchases of software licenses during 2010 and an increase in excess tax benefit from stock-based awards.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S12	We have reclassed excess tax benefits to financing activities, resulting in a corresponding decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S13	Accounts receivable increased approximately 10% while revenue increased approximately 30% during fiscal year 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P97_S14	This can be attributed to our DSO decreasing to 49 days for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a DSO of 56 days for the fourth quarter of 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	The cash used by investing activities increased by $20.4 million to $53.6 million from $33.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment, capitalized software development costs and our short-term investment activities.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	We make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	Our investment in equipment consists primarily of purchases of technology infrastructure to provide service stability and additional capacity to support our expanding client base.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	We purchased $6.3 million of additions and upgrades to our technology infrastructure during the year 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P99_S3	We plan on purchasing approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million on our technology infrastructure for the year 2011.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P99_S4	Our purchases of property were primarily for adding additional space to our existing leased and owned facilities and for new computers to support our growth in the number of employees.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P99_S5	The purchases for facilities and other employee related growth was approximately $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	plan on spending approximately $3.0 million of additional facility expansion and other employee related growth items to meet our hiring plans for the next twelve months.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	Our investment in software development consist of company managed-design, development, and testing of new application functionality with our less mature service offerings, which primarily include our athenaClinicals and athenaCommunicator service offerings.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	Our capitalized software development amounted to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	We plan to spend approximately $6.0 million to $7.0 million on software development projects for the year 2011.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	During 2010, we purchased an aircraft for $3.1 million to transport our employees between our operational locations and for customer and prospects visits.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	The cash provided in financing activities increased by $11.5 million to $14.1 million from $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The increase is attributable to an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the increase in the excess tax benefit from stock-based awards.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	We recorded a reduction in income tax liability of $9.2 related to excess tax deductions received from employee stock option exercises.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	The benefit was recorded as additional paid in capital.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P102_S4	We also recorded $0.2 million payment of contingent consideration relating to the Anodyne acquisition that was recorded as of the acquisition date.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	We have contractual obligations under our equipment line of credit, revolving and term loans and we also maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010:
1131096_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	These amounts exclude interest payments of $0.3 million that are due in the next three years on the capital lease obligations and $1.0 million that are due in the next four years on our long-term debt obligations.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	The commitments under our operating leases shown above consist primarily of lease payments for our Watertown, Massachusetts, corporate headquarters; our Rome, Georgia, offices; our Alpharetta, Georgia, subsidiary location; and our Chennai, India, subsidiary location.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	On February 15, 2008, we purchased a complex of buildings, including approximately 133,000 square feet of office space, on approximately 53 acres of land located in Belfast, Maine, for a total purchase price of $6.2 million from a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	We use this facility as a second operational service site and intend to lease a small portion of the space to commercial tenants.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Other amount consists of uncertain tax benefits.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we have $4.7 million accrued for contingent considerations estimated to be payable upon Anodyne reaching specific performance metrics over the initial three years of operations after acquisition.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	As of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date.
1131096_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, or do not apply to our operations.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	None of our consolidated revenues are generated outside the United States.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	None of our vendor relationships, including our contracts with our offshore service providers, International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Process Business Solutions Inc., for work performed in India or the Philippines, is denominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Although the contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, the fees in one of our vendor contracts are subject to adjustment based upon fluctuation in exchange rates between the India Rupees and the U.S. dollar.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P1_S4	In 2010 and 2009, 1.0% and 0.9%, respectively, of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in Chennai, India, and were incurred in Indian rupees.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.9 million at December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits, money market funds, and short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The value of these securities, however, will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had long-term debt and capital lease obligations totaling $9.2 million, which have both variable and fixed interest rate components.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We have entered into interest rate swaps as a hedge relating to variability in interest rate movements on our term loan.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For floating rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.
1131096_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The table below summarizes the principal terms of our interest rate swap transaction, including the notional amount of the swap, the interest rate payment we receive from and pay to our swap counterparty, the term of the transaction, and its fair market value at December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are located beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1131096_11_ITEM9_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2010 (the Evaluation Date ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934).
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management, including our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	In conducting this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Deloitte and Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P9_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_11_ITEM9A_P13_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the change in the Company s method of accounting for business combinations on January 1, 2009.

1131096_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.

1131096_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1131096_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for business combinations on January 1, 2009.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	General athenahealth, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our ) is a business services company that provides ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services to its customers.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	The Company provides these services with the use of athenaNet, a proprietary Internet-based practice management application.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company s customers consist of medical group practices ranging in size throughout the United States of America.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	In August 2005, the Company established a subsidiary in Chennai, India, athenahealth Technology Private Limited, to conduct research and development activities.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	On April 10, 2009, the Company established a Massachusetts corporation, athenahealth MA, Inc., to hold a share of common stock of athenahealth Technology Private Limited.

1131096_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Company paid cash for Anodyne.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P31_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the guidance on business combinations.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in similar industries and stages of development, including, but not limited to, competition from larger companies, a volatile market for its services, new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, third-party service providers and vendors, protection of proprietary technology, fluctuations in operating results, dependence on market acceptance of its products, and compliance with government regulations.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income includes net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including the estimated expected customer life; (2) allowance for doubtful accounts; (3) asset impairments; (4) depreciable lives of assets; (5) economic lives and fair value of leased assets; (6) income tax reserves and valuation allowances; (7) fair value of stock-based compensation; (8) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (9) fair value of contingent consideration; and (10) litigation reserves.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, or do not apply to the Company s operations.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	See discussion below relating to the adoption of new authoritative guidance relating to revenue recognition.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the customer, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company derives its revenue from business services fees, implementation fees, and other services.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	Business services fees include amounts charged for ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services and are generally billed to the customer as a percentage of total collections.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P38_S2	Business services fees also include amounts charged to customers for generating and mailing patient statements and are recognized as the related services are performed.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company does not recognize revenue for business services fees until these collections are made, as the services fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Implementation revenue consists primarily of professional services fees related to assisting customers with the implementation of the Company s services and are generally billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation is complete and then recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be twelve years.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company evaluates the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on our experience with customer contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those customers will receive benefits from our current portfolio of services.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P40_S2	Other services consist primarily of training, consulting services and interface fees and are recognized as the services are performed.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new accounting standards for revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	This new authoritative guidance amends previously issued guidance to eliminate the residual method of allocation for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	The new authoritative guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which includes (1) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if available, (2) third-party evidence ( TPE ), if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, and (3) estimated selling price ( ESP ), if neither vendor-specific nor third party evidence is available.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S3	Additionally, it expands the disclosure requirements related to a vendor s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S4	During the second quarter of 2010 the Company elected to adopt early, as permitted by the guidance.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S5	As such, the Company has prospectively (retroactive to January 1, 2010) applied the provisions of the new authoritative guidance to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S6	Adopting the new standard will require the Company to allocate the arrangement consideration if multiple service offerings are sold at the same time.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P41_S7	A sale of multiple services offerings could include any combination of the Company s services.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	In accordance with the new authoritative guidance, the Company allocates arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	The Company determines selling price using VSOE, if it exists; otherwise, the Company uses TPE.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P42_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, the Company uses ESP.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	VSOE is generally limited to the price charged when the same or similar product is sold separately.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	If a product or service is seldom sold separately, it is unlikely that the Company can determine VSOE for the product or service.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company defines VSOE as a median price of recent standalone transactions that are priced within a narrow range, as defined by the Company.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	TPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	It may be difficult for the Company to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing to substantiate TPE and therefore the Company may not always be able to use TPE.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	If the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, and the order was received or materially modified after the implementation date of January 1, 2010, for the new authoritative guidance, the Company will use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which the Company would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company s determination of ESP involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P47_S2	The Company considered the selling price for similar services, our ongoing pricing strategy and policies, the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company analyzes the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration at a minimum on an annual basis.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	Selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in the Company s selling prices.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting under the new authoritative literature if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company considers a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	Further, the Company s revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	The appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the adoption of this guidance had no material impact.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	The new accounting standards for revenue recognition, if applied in the same manner to the year ended December 31, 2009, would not have had a material impact on total net revenue for that fiscal year.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P51_S2	In terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition, the new accounting guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on total net revenue in periods immediately after the initial adoption.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients; claims processing costs; implementing new clients; and other direct costs related to collection and business services.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	Costs associated with the implementation of new clients are expensed as incurred.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P52_S2	The reported amounts of direct operating expenses do not include allocated amounts for rent and overhead costs (which are included in general and administrative costs), and depreciation, amortization (which are broken out separately on the statement of operations), except for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	All such costs are expensed as incurred.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and other liquid securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	Investments Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase based upon management s intent with regard to such investments.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1131096_11_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Company classifies its investments on the consolidated balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on the maturity of the instrument.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P55_S3	The Company determines realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represents amounts due from customers for services and implementation services.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts, which is determined by establishing reserves for specific accounts and consideration of historical and estimated probable losses.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
1131096_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	The other financial instruments approximate their fair value, primarily because of their short-term nature which include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	The carrying amounts of the Company s debt obligations approximate fair value based upon our best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar debt obligations.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Derivative financial instruments are used to manage certain of the Company s interest rate exposures.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes, nor does the Company hold or issue any financial instruments for trading purposes.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	In October 2008, the Company entered into a derivative instrument that is not designated as hedge.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Company entered into the derivative instrument to offset the cash flow exposure associated with its interest payments on certain outstanding debt.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P60_S4	Derivatives are carried at fair value, as determined using standard valuation models and adjusted, when necessary, for credit risk and are separately presented on the balance sheet.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P60_S5	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings and are separately presented.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	Equipment, furniture and, fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from three to five years.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the applicable lease terms, excluding renewal periods.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P62_S2	Buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over 30 years.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Building improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining life of the building.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	The airplane is depreciated using the straight-line method over 20 years.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the asset carrying value.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P66_S2	Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P66_S3	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, or 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of funds held under a letter of credit as a condition of the Company s operating lease for its corporate headquarters (see Note 9).
1131096_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	The letter of credit was reduced in 2008 to $856.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P67_S2	The letter of credit will remain in effect during the term of the lease agreement.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	MedicalMessaging and Anodyne (see Note 7).
1131096_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	Of the remaining balance, $330 relates to MedicalMessaging and will be paid in the first quarter of 2011 as MedicalMessaging achieved the final financial milestone set forth in the purchase agreement during 2010.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P68_S2	Restricted cash relating to the purchase of Anodyne at December 31, 2010, was $7,505, and may be paid over a three-year period starting in 2010 if Anodyne achieves certain business and financial milestones or may be released to the Company to cover indemnification claims.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	Software Development Costs The Company accounts for software development costs based on required criteria and timing.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	Costs related to the preliminary project stage of subsequent versions of athenaNet or other technologies are expensed as incurred.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	Costs incurred in the application development stage are capitalized, and such costs are amortized over the software s estimated economic life.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P69_S3	The estimated useful life of the software release is two years.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P69_S4	Amortization expense was $2,563, $2,110, and $1,395 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P69_S5	Future amortization expense for all software development costs capitalized as of December 31, 2010, is estimated to be $2,597 and $1,045 for the years ending December 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P70_S2	The Company evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	If the fair value of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets consist of technology and customer relationships acquired in connection with business acquisitions and are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Company concluded that use of the straight-line method was appropriate as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no significant degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	Accrued expenses and accrued compensation Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of rent escalation payment terms, tenant improvement allowances and other incentives received from landlords related to the Company s operating leases for its facilities.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which is recorded by the Company over the term of the lease, including any construction period.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	The excess is recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord as part of the negotiated terms of the lease or reimbursements of moving costs.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	These cash payments are recorded as deferred rent from landlords and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense, over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	Deferred revenue includes certain deferred implementation services fees which are recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be twelve years.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	In the quarter when a customer terminates, any unrecognized service fees associated with implementation services before and after services have been started are recognized as revenue in that quarter.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	Business Combinations On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the new authoritative guidance on business combinations.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	This guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements significant aspects of a business combination.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	Under this guidance, acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred; non-controlling interests are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development ( IPR D ) is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed rather than capitalized; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will affect income tax expense.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	In connection with a 2009 acquisition discussed in Note 7, the Company expensed $751 of acquisition costs that, prior to the change in accounting, would have been included as part of the purchase price.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	In addition, the potential contingent consideration of $7,700 was recorded in the initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of $5,100.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P81_S2	The difference between the estimated and earn-out amount will be charged or credited to expense.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P81_S3	The contingent consideration for acquisitions which occurred prior to this change are recorded as additional goodwill when the contingent consideration is earned.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P81_S4	In addition, under the provisions of this guidance, future reversal of the Company s acquisition-related tax reserves of $680 (excluding interest and penalties) will be recorded in earnings, rather than as an adjustment to goodwill or acquisition related other intangible assets and will affect the Company s annual effective income tax rate.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, and accounts receivable.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company attempts to limit its credit risk associated with cash equivalents and investments by investing in highly rated corporate and financial institutions, and engages with highly rated financial institutions as a counterparty to its derivative transaction.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	With respect to customer accounts receivable, the Company manages its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its customers.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P82_S3	No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues or accounts receivable as of or for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, or 2008.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	Our income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the balance sheet date to be recognized in the related period.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company s policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	Sales and Use Taxes the Company s services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P87_S1	The Company s contractual agreements with its customers provide that payment of any sales or use taxes assessments are the responsibility of the customer.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P87_S2	In certain jurisdictions sales taxes are collected from the customer and remitted to the respective agencies.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P87_S3	These taxes are recorded on a net basis and excluded from revenue and expense in our financial statements as presented.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief decision-maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company, which uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has determined that it operates in one segment.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company accounts for share-based awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, and restricted stock units with compensation cost measured using the fair value of the awards issued.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	The financial position and results of operations of the Company s foreign subsidiary are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P90_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P90_S3	Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded within other comprehensive income.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P91_S2	Potentially dilutive securities include stock options and warrants.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P91_S3	Under the treasury stock method, dilutive securities are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the periods and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P91_S4	Securities are excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	The following table reconciles the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 844 stock options and restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2010, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 1,021 and 1,088 stock options for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their estimated fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	Included in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, are money market fund investments of $10,799 and $10,081, respectively, which are reported at fair value.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	The carrying amounts of the Company s debt obligations approximate fair value based upon our best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar debt obligations.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P96_S1	The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been or will be realized in the future.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	The following table presents information about the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities obtained from readily available pricing sources for similar instruments.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P97_S2	The fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable values which are supported by little or no market activity.
1131096_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	sheet as of December 31, 2010.

1131096_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on August 21, 1997, as Athena Healthcare Incorporated.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	We changed our name to athenahealth.com, Inc. on March 31, 2000, and to athenahealth, Inc. on November 17, 2000.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts, 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Overview athenahealth provides business services that help medical care givers collect more revenue and greatly reduce the trouble and inconvenience of their administrative tasks.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	Through a combination of three distinct but interconnected components cloud-based software, networked knowledge, and back-office work athenahealth enables its providers to achieve and sustain financial health while keeping their focus on quality patient care.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our services are designed to reduce the burden presented by complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many of the related tasks that distract medical care givers and staff from delivering care.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S3	We differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements to clients via our cloud-based network, athenaNet, requiring no action by the client.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S4	Since athenaNet is web-based, our staff can quickly and seamlessly implement our services at a low up-front start-up cost to clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our cloud-based services are currently packaged as four integrated offerings: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management, athenaClinicals for clinical cycle management, athenaCommunicator for patient cycle management, and athenaCoordinator for referral cycle management.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S6	Our single-instance platform allows every client to benefit from the collective knowledge of all other clients through our patented billing Rules Engine and clinical Quality Management Engine, collectively called athenaRules.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S7	This powerful, shared knowledge enables our clients to monitor and benchmark their performances against those of peer practices across the network.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P2_S8	Our comprehensive business intelligence application, Anodyne Analytics, further supports our clients goal of financial health by equipping them with data visualization tools and insight into their practice s performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	The software offered via athenaNet is the primary conduit through which we exchange information among clients, payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Expert knowledge is infused into each service via athenaRules as we work with clients, payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	Each service also benefits from back-office administrative work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	We automate these processes whenever possible, but, when automation cannot be implemented, we perform the work ourselves rather than returning it to clients to be completed.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S4	This unique service model of Software, Knowledge, and Work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance, creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S5	We charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases, so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue for them.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S6	In 2000, we released our first service offering, athenaCollector, and followed with athenaClinicals in 2006.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S7	athenaCommunicator, introduced in 2010, represents the integration and rebranding of our first acquisition, Crest Line Technologies, LLC (d.b.a. MedicalMessaging.net).
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S8	We continued this expansion of our offerings in October, 2009, with our acquisition of Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. ( Anodyne ), the privately held company that developed the Anodyne Analytics service.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S9	Then, in August, 2011, to further accelerate the development of our emerging care coordination service, we acquired Proxsys LLC ( Proxsys ), a leading provider of cloud-based care coordination services between physicians and hospitals.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P3_S10	In 2011, we generated revenue of $324.1 million from the sale of our services, compared to $245.5 million in 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there were 32,740 medical providers, including 23,210 physicians, using our athenaCollector service across 46 states and the District of Columbia and 76 medical specialties.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	The health care industry is complex and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that do not offer the core competencies of collaboration, flexibility, and interoperability.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	A disproportionate amount of communication still takes place on paper instead of via automated communications.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	outdated, inflexible systems and paper workflows creates significant costs for medical practices, which suffer sizable administrative work, as well as duplication and errors.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	By addressing these problems head on, medical care givers can free their staff to focus on the practice of medicine.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	While the fee-for-service reimbursement framework is fraught with complexity for medical practices, managed care plans typically are even more complex, creating reimbursement structures that are more complicated than previous methods, with greater responsibility placed on care givers to capture and provide appropriate data to obtain payments.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	This reality is further complicated by newer, emerging reimbursement models such as Pay-For-Reporting, Pay-For-Performance, and Shared Savings.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	These programs require care givers to identify programs for which they are eligible, enroll in those programs, identify eligible patients, and record relevant billing and clinical data for each eligible encounter.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, care givers may be penalized for non-reporting or non-participation in these programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	Many of these programs also require a much greater focus on care coordination and cost efficiency across multiple care givers .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	Practice-based activities required to ensure appropriate payment for services rendered have increased in number and complexity for the following reasons:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Legislative reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, that was signed into law in March 2010, is expected to drive many fundamental shifts in the health care reimbursement landscape.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	Millions of additional patients could be required to purchase health insurance coverage, and private payers may have to limit percentages of non-clinical expenses as a portion of their revenues.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	Payers abilities to raise insurance premiums will likely also be regulated, forcing them to focus on other ways of improving their financial performance, including new contracting options for physicians and new programs to identify preventable costs.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	Many of these programs would require the aggregation and exchange of clinical data in order to ensure continuity of care for each patient.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Diversity of health benefit plan design .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Health insurers have introduced a wide range of benefit structures, many of which are customized to the unique goals of particular employer groups.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	This has resulted in an increase in rules regarding who is eligible for health care services, what health care services are eligible for reimbursement, and who is responsible to pay for health care services delivered.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	It has also resulted in more plans that require a larger portion of patient responsibility, such as High Deductible Health Plans ( HDHP ) or plans with little coverage other than negotiated discounts; these increase the burden on practices to manage and pursue receivables directly with the patient.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Dynamic nature of health benefit plan design .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Health insurers continually update their reimbursement rules based on ongoing monitoring of consumption patterns, in response to new medical products and procedures, and to address changing employer demands.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	As these changes are made frequently throughout the year and are often specific to each individual health plan, practices need to be continually aware of this dynamic element of the reimbursement cycle, as it could impact overall reimbursement and specific workflows.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Proliferation of new payment models .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	New health benefit plans and reimbursement structures have considerably modified the ways in which medical practices are paid.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	Care-based initiatives like Pay-for-Performance, which provide reimbursement incentives related to the capture and submission of specified clinical information, have dramatically increased the administrative and clinical documentation burden of the medical practice.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Shared Savings programs like Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, reward care givers for managing care in a cost-efficient way; this requires greater coordination of clinical effort across medical practices and their trading partners.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	These newer models continue to evolve and grow in both number and complexity.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	New financial incentives spurring a new wave of EHR purchasing activity .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	The federal government has enacted a financial incentive program through the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act ) for care givers who demonstrate Meaningful Use of a certified Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) technology.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	opportunity, they have shifted recent buying patterns, with many care givers accelerating their purchase of EHRs and making revenue cycle decisions tied to an EHR selection.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	In addition to administering typical business functions, care givers must invest significant time and resources processing inbound and outbound communications related to physician orders, including referrals to specialists, imaging centers, laboratories, pharmacies, and inpatient admissions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	In order to process these communications, medical practices often interact with multiple software systems; execute paper-based and fax-based communications to and from payers and other trading partners; and contact patients, payers, and other trading partners to effectively communicate the appropriate clinical information to accompany the order.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	All of this work must be conducted to ensure that the patient receives appropriate care and the procedure is eligible for reimbursement.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our mission is to be medical care givers most trusted service.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	In almost all cases, we price our services as a percentage of practice collections, which incentivizes us to improve practice performance while simultaneously reducing cost through more efficient operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	As practices face rising costs, greater complexity, and changing reimbursement rates, they need solutions for a diverse set of problems.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	These problems include increased administrative work required to manage new reimbursement models; greater demand from trading partners and Shared Savings program members for electronic data exchange; pressure to adopt expensive EHRs; continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards; new insurance payer rules; more complicated reimbursement structures; and increased work to collect self-pay balances from uninsured, underinsured, and HDHP patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that traditional, locally installed software fails to address all of these needs, solving only a subset of problems that can be managed through electronic storage and data transmission, without allowing for intelligent evolution of the functionality.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	Locally installed software also favors larger organizations that can afford an up-front investment in hardware and software, as well as the staff to manage and maintain these systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	Cloud-based software can solve a greater set of these problems particularly when implemented in a single instance because it can be quickly updated and delivered to all clients without expensive upgrades or new hardware installation.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S5	However, there remain many challenges that even cloud-based software alone cannot address without a corresponding service component.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S6	Examples include processing and sorting all incoming paper documents that a practice receives; identifying and managing payer rules; identifying and enrolling care givers in Pay-For-Performance programs; selecting and alerting care givers to Pay-for-Performance measures for specific patients; and taking patient phone calls with a live operator when a practice is closed.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S7	Our unique service model addresses these problems for clients through cloud-based software that delivers targeted knowledge to the right user at the right time, and through large service operations that can achieve a comparative advantage by executing work at scale that would otherwise fall upon the practice.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S8	The electronic connectivity and system infrastructure that we provide would normally be out of reach for small independent practices, which make up the majority of the care giver market.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S9	However, because we automate processes and scale work across our entire provider network, we can efficiently deliver our services to medical practices of every size.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S10	By enabling small practices to receive the same level of technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefit not only to practices but also to all of their trading partners and fellow Shared Savings program members.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S11	As practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility will enhance our ability to compete, regardless of whether the practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P18_S12	Key elements of our strategy include:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Remaining intensely focused on our clients success .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our business model aligns our goals with our clients goals, providing us with an ongoing incentive to improve client performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	We believe that this approach enables us to maintain client loyalty (demonstrated through high and sustained client satisfaction and retention), enhance our reputation, and improve the quality of our solutions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Integration of revenue cycle, clinical cycle, patient cycle, and referral cycle .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	As payment models continue to integrate cost efficiency and performance into reimbursement formulas, activities that previously were not factors in reimbursement will become more important in driving practice performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Only practices that control these activities in a way that is fully integrated with their revenue cycle will have visibility into their true financial health.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	Some examples might be care handoffs between physicians and trading partners, care coordination to prevent duplicate procedures, patient adherence reminders, and closed-loop prescription and lab order management.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	We proactively demonstrate to practices how, when fully adopted and optimized, our integrated services athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, athenaCommunicator, and athenaCoordinator can help care givers manage and monitor performance comprehensively.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our Rules Engine leverages our single-instance platform to allow all clients to benefit from knowledge across the network.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	We actively seek out new revenue opportunities for practices and use the Rules Engine to deliver the right information to the right person at the right time.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	For athenaCollector clients, these rules are introduced during charge entry and claim submission to alert users to any errors or omissions; this increases the percentage of transactions that are successfully executed on the first attempt and reduces the time it takes to fully resolve claims or other transactions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We continually build our centralized payer reimbursement rules by learning from the collective experience of our national network of clients, as well as through proactive outreach to payers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	The rules embedded in athenaClinicals are becoming increasingly tied to reimbursement as more Pay-for-Reporting, Pay-for-Performance, and other bonus payments require specific action at the point of care.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The athenaClinicals workflow allows customizable alerts to surface during the encounter to ensure that the proper quality measures are being prompted.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Without the type of automation found in our Quality Management Engine, these payment programs would plague physicians with an administrative burden, significantly impairing their ability to practice.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Increasing awareness and attracting new clients .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that our cloud-based business services provide significant value for medical practices of any size, and we continue to expand sales and marketing efforts to address our market opportunity and aggressively seek new clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our athenaCollector client base currently represents approximately four percent of the addressable U.S. market, comprised of an estimated 650,000 physicians practicing in the ambulatory segment.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	In addition to our traditional marketing efforts targeted at small and group practices, we have introduced several new programs to reach hospitals and health systems, to help them manage their affiliated and employed physician strategies.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Uncovering and delivering new sources of revenue to clients .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have worked closely with payers and other health care trading partners to demonstrate the process efficiencies and reduction in administrative work that our services provide to medical practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	We believe that, as these trading partners gain understanding of these advantages and related system-wide benefits, they will reward these efficiencies in a manner that accrues direct benefits for our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	High levels of user adoption and network transparency .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	One of the biggest challenges for traditional EHR software vendors has been lack of physician adoption.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Many physicians have not used software templates to habitually document encounters and fear that EHRs will slow them down.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	Traditional documentation styles such as paper or dictation are preferred in many cases.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	Due to our large service operation, we can support many alternate documentation styles that are not available with software-only solutions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S4	For example, physicians can continue to document on paper and transmit that document to us to be processed and attached to the patient chart.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S5	By supporting multiple work styles and integrating these activities into the complete revenue, clinical, and patient cycles, our clients realize significant benefits by using our EHR, which drives our high adoption rate.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S6	We, in turn, convert this usage data into system-wide measures of top-line practice performance, individual clinician performance, and the associated drivers of each.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P28_S7	We can then share this intelligence on the measures that correlate with, or drive, practice performance with our entire network of clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our Solutions Our service offerings are based on our proprietary cloud-based software, a continually updated database of rules, and integrated back-office service operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our services are designed to help our clients achieve faster reimbursement from all parties, reduce error rates, increase collections, lower operating costs, improve operational workflow controls, and more efficiently manage clinical and billing information.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	athenaCollector and Anodyne Analytics Our principal offering, athenaCollector, is our revenue cycle management service.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	It automates and manages billing-related functions for medical practices and includes a practice management platform.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	athenaCollector assists our clients with the proper handling of claims and billing processes to help manage reimbursement quickly and efficiently.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P30_S3	Complementing athenaCollector is our business intelligence offering, Anodyne Analytics, which provides physicians and practice managers with comprehensive, detailed insight into practice performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Through athenaNet, athenaCollector utilizes the Internet to connect medical practices to our Rules Engine and service operations team.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	athenaCollector is a complete practice management system that includes scheduling, payment processing, and a workflow dashboard.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	The system is used by our clients and our services team to track claims requiring edits in real-time before they are sent to the payer, claims requiring work that have come back from the payer unpaid, and claims that are being held up due to administrative steps required by the individual client.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	This web-native functionality provides our clients with the benefits of our payer rules database as it is updated and enables them to interact with our services team to efficiently monitor workflows.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	Each transaction runs through our centralized Rules Engine so preventable mistakes can be corrected quickly across all of our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	We also include a full set of reporting tools in athenaNet, so that users can track their ongoing performance and benchmark it against other practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	With the acquisition of Anodyne in October 2009, we expanded the business intelligence function of our existing services through the addition of Anodyne Analytics.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	that data visually through a wide array of business performance metrics.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	These metrics can be provided either as broad, practice-wide summaries or as discrete, highly specific analyses based on complex user-defined requests.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	In the future, we plan to further leverage the additional detail and analysis offered by Anodyne Analytics and the Anodyne Intelligence Platform to visually present other data sets such as clinical and patient cycle metrics.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Knowledge (athenaRules) Medical practices route all of their day-to-day electronic and paper-based payer communications to us, which we then process using our patented billing Rules Engine and service operations to avoid reimbursement delays and improve practice performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our proprietary database of payer knowledge has been constructed based on over eleven years of experience in handling the physician workflow in thousands of medical practices, with medical claims from tens of thousands of health benefit packages.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	The core focus of the database is on the payer rules, which are the key drivers of claim payment and denials.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	Understanding denials allows us to construct rules to avoid future denials across our entire client base, resulting in increased automation of our workflow processes.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	On average, over 100 rules are added to or revised in our Rules Engine each month.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	athenaRules has been designed to interact seamlessly with athenaNet in the medical office workflow and with our service operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Work (athenahealth Service Operations) athenahealth service operations enable the service teams that collaborate with client staff to achieve successful transactions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	infrastructure used to execute the key steps associated with proper handling of physician claims and clinical data management.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	The service operations team is comprised of over 1,000 people who interact with physicians, providers, and clinicians at all of the key steps in the revenue cycle, including:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	providing proactive and responsive client support to manage issues, address questions, identify training needs, and communicate trends.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	athenaClinicals athenaClinicals is our EHR service, which automates and manages medical-record-management-related functions for practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	It assists medical groups with the proper handling of physician documentation, orders, and related inbound and outbound communications to ensure that orders are carried out quickly and accurately.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	athenaClinicals is designed to improve clinical administrative workflow.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Software (athenaNet) Through athenaNet, athenaClinicals displays key clinical measures, by office location related to the drivers of high quality and efficient care delivery, on a workflow dashboard, including lab results requiring review, patient referral requests, prescription requests, and family history of previous exams.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	athenaClinicals is a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR technology and has been certified by the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology ( CCHIT ), an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Similar to its functionality within athenaCollector, athenaNet provides comprehensive reporting on a range of clinical results, including distribution of different procedure codes (leveling), incidence of different diagnoses, timeliness of turnaround by lab companies and other intermediaries, and other key performance indicators.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	Knowledge (athenaRules) Reporting and quality programs have collectively become a greater portion of physician revenue but are very difficult to manage on paper or in a static software system, where the user is not prompted for the appropriate action to be taken.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Clinical data must be captured according to the requirements and incentives of different payers and plans.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	Clinical intermediaries such as laboratories and pharmacy networks require specific formats and data elements, as well.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	athenaRules is designed to access medication formularies, identify potential medication errors (such as drug-to-drug interactions or allergy reactions), and identify the specific clinical activities that are required to adhere to Pay-for-Performance programs, including Medicare incentive payments under the HITECH Act.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	Work (athenahealth Service Operations) Medical practices that use an EHR still receive large amounts of paper documentation from third parties.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	These can include consult letters, lab results, general correspondence, and multiple other document types.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	Practices can receive an average of over 1,000 clinical documents per provider per month, creating a significant administrative burden.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our service operations capture inbound paper documents, convert them to electronic format, attach them to the appropriate patient chart, classify them according to type, and associate results with the original order where applicable.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	Additionally, even if the physician creates an order in the EHR, the intended recipient may not accept orders electronically; in that case, we reduce the electronically generated order to paper for delivery on behalf of the practice.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	We also perform many of the Pay-for-Performance program identification and enrollment tasks on behalf of practices so that they can participate without significant up-front research and effort.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Through athenaNet, athenaCommunicator which includes ReminderCall (part of the acquisition of Crest Line Technologies, LLC in September 2008) and other automated patient messaging services, live operator services, and a patient portal was commercially released in the first half of 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	These services help reduce patient no-show rates and improve overall schedule density, which increases the number of revenue-generating appointments for our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	The ability to increase patient outreach also helps provide clinical education and adherence reminders to patients, which increases the quality of care and improves outcomes without increasing practice demand to monitor and contact patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	The service provides a personalized, high-quality experience for patients while driving practice performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P47_S4	Software (athenaNet) athenaCommunicator allows practices to manage many patient communication tasks electronically, including use of automated reminder calls with customizable criteria and opt-out functionality; creation of a self-service patient portal for registration, appointment requests, bill payments, and general communication; automatic generation of emails to patients; and patient education tools.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P47_S5	The automated phone calls are multi- purpose and may include appointment reminders, outbound campaigns, and follow-up on outstanding balances while prompting patients to make payments by mail, telephone, or online through our systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Knowledge (athenaRules) athenaCommunicator allows practices to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	They can set patient or group-specific communication preferences that will automatically tailor communications to the preferred timing and mode of delivery, including phone call, e-mail, or patient portal.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	These communication rules allow each patient to receive a personalized experience, including delivery of messages with branding and using the Caller ID of the practice, if desired.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Practices spend a great deal of time fielding phone calls from patients on topics ranging from scheduling requests, bill payment, directions, and clinical cases.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	As part of the athenaCommunicator service, we provide live operators who field these calls on behalf of practices, including redirected automated calls for appointment scheduling, patient payments, and message-taking.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	We also print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of the practice to assist with patient payment collection.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	Collectively, these activities expand the availability of the office to patients and help free staff to focus on more critical tasks.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	The result of athenahealth s acquisition of Proxsys LLC in August 2011, athenaCoordinator is a referral cycle management tool that helps streamline the disorganized system of patient care coordination.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	connections between practices and points of patient referral are rife with inefficiencies due to patient data redundancies, manual inputs, and errors, resulting in additional practice workload and patient dissatisfaction.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	With athenaCoordinator, care givers can efficiently deliver a clean referral order to a physician, hospital, or other supply-chain partner.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	This much-needed improvement in today s health care reduces unnecessary phone calls and faxes, eliminates redundancies, and greatly reduces both the error rate and patient frustration.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Software (athenaNet) athenaCoordinator allows providers, via an easy-to-use online portal, to electronically prepare and send a clean order for a referral meaning all the pertinent information needed to streamline care coordination is complete and a patient can arrive at his or her appointment with another physician, or at a hospital or lab, with information already entered and verified.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	This information can include the order details, the patient s insurance eligibility, any necessary pre-certification, information the receiving provider needs to fulfill and bill the order, and details on any prior authorizations that are needed.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	This type of efficient information transfer delivers benefits to both the referring and receiving providers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P53_S3	For the initial care giver, athenaCoordinator reduces time spent managing outbound orders and can provide greater visibility to patient status after the referring visit.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P53_S4	For the receiving care giver, athenaCoordinator reduces denials, the time spent processing referrals, and the risk of acting on erroneous information.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P53_S5	Referring providers who use athenaClinicals can also receive a detailed care summary of the referral, effectively closing the loop of patient care.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	As part of a streamlined path of coordinated care information, athenahealth s powerful, cloud-based Rules Engine automatically determines a patient s insurance eligibility after a referring provider enters an order via the web-based portal.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	This cuts down on the need for practice staff to manually contact an insurer and allows a patient to arrive at a receiving provider with his or her coverage eligibility already confirmed.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	Both the patient and the receiving hospital or lab staff can then focus on care and not get bogged down in insurance eligibility research at the point of care.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	Preparing referral orders can often require office staff to spend time managing administrative duties and they ll often not receive follow-up information after a patient has visited a referred lab, physician, or hospital.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P54_S4	As part of athenaCoordinator, athenahealth staff takes over this work, benefitting both the referring and receiving providers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P54_S5	athenahealth back-office operations will verify insurance and benefits with payers, secure pre-certification, handle patient registration, collect self-pay from the patient, and electronically deliver the order to the receiving provider in advance of the patient visit.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Research and Development Our research and development efforts focus on enhancing our service offerings in response to changes in the market and evolving our technology platform to better serve medical practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	All of our clients use the same version of our software, although some athenaRules are designed to take effect locally for particular clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	We continually update our software and rules and execute bimonthly releases of new software functionality for our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our software development life cycle methodology ensures that each software release is properly designed, built, tested, and rolled out.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S4	Our software development technologists are primarily located in the United States; we complement this team s work with software development services from third-party technology development providers in Huntsville, Alabama, and Pune, India, as well as our own employees at our development center operated through our subsidiary in Chennai, India.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S5	In addition to our core software development activities, we dedicate full-time staff to our ongoing development and maintenance of the rules database.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S6	On average, over 100 rules are added or revised in our billing Rules Engine each month.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P55_S7	We also employ program management and product management personnel, who work continually on improvements to our service operations processes and our service design, respectively.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	The team behind athenaRules is based in Watertown, Massachusetts, and is supported by employees at all of our locations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	This team is responsible for creating the billing rules that alert clients to potential problems on claims and for the creation of the clinical rules that alert clinical staff to quality measures applicable to particular patients and encounters.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	Some key metrics delivered by the athenaIntelligence team in 2011 were:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	93.7% of claims resolved on the first submission.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Taken as a whole, these activities result, in most cases, in a direct reduction in practices work.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Rather than submitting a claim with missing information, waiting for adjudication, receiving a denial, and then resubmitting the claim to start the cycle over again, our practices are alerted to issues prior to the first submission.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Similarly, practices are spared the tedious process of identifying upcoming appointments for patients that qualify for a specific Pay-for-Performance program and then remembering to track the appropriate measure during the encounter; instead, athenaClinicals introduces the measure seamlessly into the workflow.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	Our operations team assists clients at each critical step in the revenue cycle, clinical cycle, patient cycle, and referral cycle workflow processes and provides services that include insurance benefits packaging, insurance eligibility confirmation, claims submission, claims tracking, remittance posting, denials management, payment processing, formatting of lab requisitions, submission of lab requisitions, and monitoring and classification of all inbound faxes.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P59_S3	Additionally, we use third parties for data entry, data matching, data characterization, and outbound and inbound telephone services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P59_S4	We have contracted with International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our operations team.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P59_S5	These services are generally commercially available at comparable rates from other service providers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	delivered 49 million automated calls to patients on behalf of practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	We depend on satisfied clients to succeed.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	Our client contracts require minimum commitments by us on a range of tasks, including claims submission, payment posting, claims tracking, and claims denial management.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	We also commit to our clients that athenaNet is accessible 99.7% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Each quarter, our management conducts a survey of clients to identify client concerns and track progress against client satisfaction objectives.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	In our most recent survey for athenaCollector, 87.3% of the respondents reported that they would recommend our services to a trusted friend or colleague.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	In addition to the services described above, we also provide client support services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	There are several client support service activities that take place on a regular basis, including the following:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	relationship management by regional leaders of the client services organization to ensure that decision- makers at client practices are satisfied and that regional performance is managed proactively with regard to client satisfaction, client margins, client retention, renewal pricing, and added services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	The increased burden on patients to pay for a larger percentage of their health care services, together with the need for care givers to have the ability to determine this patient payment responsibility at the time of service, has led some payers to develop the capability to accept and process claims in real time.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	This is frequently referred to within the industry as real time adjudication (or RTA ) because it avoids the processing time that adjudication of claims by payers has historically involved.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P64_S2	Under an RTA system, payers notify physicians immediately upon receipt of billing information if third-party claims are accepted or rejected, the amount that will be paid by the payer, and the amount that the patient may owe under the particular health plan involved.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P64_S3	Taking advantage of this payer capability, we have designed a platform for transacting with payer RTA systems that is payer-neutral and designed to integrate the various payer RTA processes so that our clients experience the same workflow regardless of payer.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P64_S4	Using this platform, we have collaborated with two major payers, Humana and United Healthcare, to process RTA transactions with their systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Sales and Marketing We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of physician clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	We expect to expand our network by selling our services to new clients and cross-selling additional services into our client base.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P65_S3	We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P65_S4	Our sales force is divided into three groups: the enterprise team, which is dedicated to professionally managed care organizations with 150 or more physicians; the group team, which is dedicated to medical practices with five to 149 physicians; and the small group team, which is dedicated to practices with one to four physicians.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients, we conduct a consultative sales process.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	This process includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	We refer to these third parties as channels and the individuals and organizations involved as our channel partners.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for providing us sales lead information that results in sales.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S3	These channel partners generally do not make sales but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S4	Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as an independent sales representative, a purchasing agent (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or a joint marketer of combined service offerings that we jointly develop with that third party.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S5	In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S6	In 2011, channel-based leads were associated with approximately 40% of our new business.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S7	Our channel relationships include state medical societies, health care information technology product companies, health care product distribution companies, consulting firms, group purchasing organizations, regional extension centers, and payers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P67_S8	Examples of these types of channel relationships include:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Humana Inc. ( Humana ) .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Under this program, eligible physicians can receive a subsidy from Humana for the purchase of our athenaClinicals service and earn additional revenue above their current fee schedule for meeting certain performance criteria.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Humana is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	d/b/a PSS World Medical Shared Services, Inc. ( PSS ) .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	In October 2010, we entered into an agreement with PSS for the marketing and sale of our revenue cycle, clinical cycle, and patient cycle services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, PSS has a non-exclusive right to distribute, sell, market, and promote our services in the United States (excluding Hawaii) and we will pay PSS commissions based upon the contract value of client orders placed through PSS.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	According to PSS, they are the largest provider of medical and surgical supplies to the physician market in the United States, with a sales force of more than 750 sales consultants who distribute medical supplies and equipment to approximately 100,000 offices in all 50 states.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Marketing Initiatives Since our service model is new to most physicians, our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so that they will view our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P73_S2	Our marketing initiatives are generally targeted toward specific segments of the medical practice market.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P73_S3	These marketing programs primarily consist of:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	In June 2006, we introduced our annual PayerView rankings to provide an industry-unique framework that systematically addresses what we believe is administrative complexity that exists between payers and providers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	PayerView is designed to look at payers performance based on a number of categories, which combine to provide an overall ranking aimed at quantifying the ease of doing business with the payer.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	All data used for the rankings come from our clients actual claims performance data and depict our experience in dealing with individual payers across the nation.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P74_S3	The rankings include payers that meet a threshold of 4,000 claims per quarter in athenaNet.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Competition We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	Our primary competition is the use of locally-installed software to manage revenue cycle, clinical cycle, and patient cycle workflow within the physician s office.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	introducing services that they refer to as on-demand or software-as-a-service models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	Software and service companies that sell practice management and EHR software and medical billing and collection services include Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; eClinicalWorks, LLC; GE Healthcare; Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc.; Quality Systems, Inc.; Sage Software Healthcare, Inc.; and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	As a service company that provides revenue cycle services, we also compete against large billing companies such as Ingenix, a division of United Healthcare, Inc.; McKesson Corp.; and regional billing companies.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P76_S3	The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition than we do, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with health care providers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P77_S3	These companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, and patent prosecution and litigation and to finance capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the services that we provide are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws and regulations, including regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as additional regulation.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	Government Regulation of Health Information HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules .
1131096_12_ITEM1_P78_S2	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it (collectively, HIPAA ) contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P78_S3	These are embodied in the Privacy Rule and Security Rule portions of HIPAA.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	The Privacy Rule imposes a complex system of requirements on covered entities for complying with this basic standard.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules apply directly to covered entities, such as health care providers who engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from the HIPAA-prescribed electronic forms and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse, and as such are a covered entity.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	In addition, our clients are also covered entities.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	In order to provide clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules require us to enter into business associate agreements with our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	that we will assist the client in question with certain of its duties under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	In addition to the Privacy and Security Rules, HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to health care billing be conducted using prescribed electronic formats.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	For example, claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to payers must comply with specific formatting standards, and these standards apply whether the payer is a government or a private entity.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P84_S2	As a covered entity subject to HIPAA, we must meet these requirements, and moreover, we must structure and provide our services in a way that supports our clients HIPAA compliance obligations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P84_S3	The HITECH Act, which became law in February 2009, and the regulations issued and to be issued under it, have provided and are expected to provide, among other things, clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P84_S4	As these additional requirements are adopted, we will be required to comply with them.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the requirements imposed by the HITECH Act, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P85_S2	For example, the Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulations issued final data security regulations, which became effective in March 2010 and establish minimum standards for protecting and storing personal information about Massachusetts residents contained in paper or electronic format.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	Government Regulation of Reimbursement Our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	Accordingly, our clients are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government health care programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P86_S2	During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other health care providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P86_S3	It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement future reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement under government programs that adversely affect our client base or our cost of providing our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	Fraud and Abuse A number of federal and state laws, loosely referred to as fraud and abuse laws, are used to prosecute health care providers, physicians, and others that make, offer, seek, or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state health care program and, in some instances, any private program.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	Given the breadth of these laws and regulations, they are potentially applicable to our business; the transactions that we undertake on behalf of our clients; and the financial arrangements through which we market, sell, and distribute our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P87_S2	These laws and regulations include: Anti-Kickback Laws.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to health care providers and patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	The federal health care programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	Courts have construed this anti-kickback law to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of one of the arrangements is to encourage patient referrals or other federal health care program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	There are several limited exclusions known as safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	These safe harbors have very limited application.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	Penalties for federal anti-kickback violations are severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties with triple damages, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	Many states have similar anti-kickback laws, some of which are not limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government health care program.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with the submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse in connection with such submission and payment, for example, by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing for the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P93_S2	These laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P93_S3	For example, one federal false claim law forbids knowing submission to government programs of false claims for reimbursement for medical items or services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P93_S4	Under this law, knowledge may consist of willful ignorance or reckless disregard of falsity.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P93_S5	How these concepts apply to services such as ours that rely substantially on automated processes has not been well defined in the regulations or relevant case law.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P93_S6	As a result, our errors with respect to the formatting, preparation, or transmission of such claims and any mishandling by us of claims information that is supplied by our clients or other third parties may be determined to, or may be alleged to, involve willful ignorance or reckless disregard of any falsity that is later determined to exist.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we charge our clients a percentage of the collections that they receive as a result of our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	To the extent that liability under fraud and abuse laws and regulations requires intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P94_S2	CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	In addition to the provisions relating to health care access and delivery, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made changes to health care fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	The PPACA expands false claim laws, amends key provisions of other anti-fraud and abuse statutes, provides the government with new enforcement tools and funding for enforcement, and enhances both criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	The PPACA may result in increased anti-fraud enforcement activities.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	Stark Law and Similar State Laws.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and health care entities.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	referring patients for certain designated health services reimbursed under federally funded programs to entities with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, unless such referrals fall within a specific exception.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P98_S1	Violations of the statute can result in civil monetary penalties and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P98_S2	Furthermore, reimbursement claims for care rendered under forbidden referrals may be deemed false or fraudulent, resulting in liability under other fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	Laws in many states similarly forbid billing based on referrals between individuals and/or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	These laws vary widely from state to state.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	In many states, there are laws that prohibit non-licensed practitioners from practicing medicine, prevent corporations from being licensed as practitioners, and prohibit licensed medical practitioners from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S3	In some states, these prohibitions take the form of laws or regulations forbidding the splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S4	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S5	There are also federal and state laws that forbid or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S6	Some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P99_S7	In particular, the Medicare program specifically requires that billing agents who receive Medicare payments on behalf of medical care providers must meet the following requirements:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	in receiving the payment, the agent must act only on behalf of the provider, except insofar as the agent uses part of that payment to compensate the agent for the agent s billing and collection services.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	Medicaid regulations similarly provide that payments may be received by billing agents in the name of their clients without violating anti-assignment requirements if payment to the agent is related to the cost of the billing service, not related on a percentage basis to the amount billed or collected, and not dependent on collection of payment.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	Electronic Prescribing Laws States have differing prescription format and signature requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	Many existing laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the methods of e-commerce now being developed.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P102_S1	However, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P102_S2	In addition, on November 7, 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services published its final E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program regulations, referred to below as the E-Prescribing Regulations.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P102_S3	These regulations are required by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ) and became effective beginning on January 1, 2006.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	These standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P103_S1	The standards apply to prescription drug plans participating in the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P103_S2	Aspects of our services are affected by such regulation, as our clients need to comply with these requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	Anti-Tampering Laws For certain prescriptions that cannot or may not be transmitted electronically from physician to pharmacy, both federal and state laws require that the written forms used exhibit anti-tampering features.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P104_S1	For example, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 has since April 2008 required that most prescriptions covered by Medicaid must demonstrate security features that prevent copying, erasing, or counterfeiting of the written form.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P104_S2	Because our clients will, on occasion, need to use printed forms, we must take these laws into consideration for purposes of the prescription functions of our athenaClinicals service.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P105_S0	Electronic Health Records Certification Requirements The HITECH Act directs the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, or ONCHIT, to support and promote meaningful use of certified EHR technology nationwide through the adoption of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria as well as the establishment of certification programs for EHR technology.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P105_S1	In January 2011, HHS issued a final rule to establish a permanent certification program for EHR technology, including how organizations can become ONC-Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies (ONC-ATCBs).
1131096_12_ITEM1_P105_S2	ONC-ATCBs are required to test and certify that EHR technology is compliant with the standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary and meet the definition of certified EHR technology.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P105_S3	In July 2010, the Secretary published the final rule that adopted standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for EHR technology.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P105_S4	Our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR by CCHIT, an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable eligible provider certification criteria adopted by the Secretary.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	While we believe our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	United States Food and Drug Administration The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices and a proposed rule for reclassification of medical device data systems under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P107_S1	The FDA has stated that health information technology software is a medical device under the FDCA, and we expect that the FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in health care settings regardless of whether the draft policy or proposed rule is finalized or changed.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P107_S2	If our computer software functionality is considered medical device under the FDCA, we could be subject to the FDA requirements discussed below.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P108_S1	Under the FDCA, medical devices include any instrument, apparatus, machine, contrivance, or other similar or related article that is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P108_S2	FDA regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and import and export.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P108_S3	FDA requirements with respect to devices that are determined to pose lesser risk to the public include:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P109_S1	Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, a recommendation by the FDA to disallow us from entering into government contracts, and criminal prosecutions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P109_S2	The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P109_S3	Foreign Regulations Our subsidiary in Chennai, India, is subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P109_S4	These regulations include Indian federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws, and qualification for tax status and tax incentives.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P110_S1	Despite these reliances, we believe the following factors are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage:
1131096_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	a continued focus on the improved financial results of our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we held two U.S. patents, with sixteen U.S. patent applications pending and seven foreign patent applications pending.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	Our first patent relates to our unique patient workflow process, including the Rules Engine, which applies proprietary rules to practice and payer inputs on a live, ongoing basis to produce cleaner health care claims, which can be adjudicated more quickly and efficiently.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	This patent was granted in November 2009 and expires in December 2023.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P112_S3	Our second patent covers the self-service implementation of a practice management system, which allows for our clients to configure their systems themselves by responding to a series of rule-based questions, thus saving time and money.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P112_S4	This second patent was granted in May 2010 and expires in July 2029.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P112_S5	We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P112_S6	We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered service marks to protect our brand.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	athenaNet, PayerView, and the athenahealth logo.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P113_S1	Anodyne Analytics, Anodyne Intelligence, athenaCoordinator, athenaEnterprise, athenaRules, Proxsys, and ReminderCall are unregistered service marks.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P114_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes the registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks of other persons.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	We have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P115_S1	Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P115_S2	In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P115_S3	Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P116_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of medical practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P116_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P116_S2	In addition, as further explained in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P117_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had 1,795 full-time employees, with 1,068 in service operations, 276 in sales and marketing, 277 in research and development, and 174 in general and administrative functions.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P117_S1	Of these full-time employees, 1,667 were located in the U.S. and 128 were located in Chennai, India.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P118_S0	We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P118_S1	None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.
1131096_12_ITEM1_P119_S0	The financial information required under this Item 1 is incorporated herein by reference to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Where You Can Find More Information Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available through the Investors portion of our website ( www.athenahealth.com ) free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.

1131096_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS GENERAL We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The provision by third parties of revenue cycle services to medical practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty, a limited set of payers, or a limited geographical area.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We anticipate that the software, statistical, and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Revenue cycle software for medical practices has historically been dominated by large, well-financed and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these entities are now offering on-demand services or a software-as-a-service model under which software is centrally administered, and administrative services may be provided on a vendor basis.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The size, financial strength, and breadth of offerings of these entities is increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and health care industries.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect large integrated technology companies to become more active in our markets, both through acquisition and internal investment.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Some of our current large competitors, such as GE Healthcare, Sage Software Healthcare, Inc., Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Quality Systems, Inc., Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., and McKesson Corp. have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S6	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S7	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S8	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S10	Further, in light of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition to new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target market.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but that offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The market for Internet-based medical business services may not develop substantially further or develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The market for Internet-based medical business services is still relatively new and narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	increase their use of on-demand business services in general, and for their revenue, clinical and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to an on-demand application service.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our success depends on providing services that the medical community uses to improve business performance and quality of service to patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients will want.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely basis, we may lose clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S9	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S10	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have been experiencing a period of rapid growth.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	To manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S8	We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent, and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S9	In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, noncompetition, and assignment of inventions agreements.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Our attempts to protect our intellectual property may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S11	While we have two issued U.S. patent and have sixteen more U.S. patent applications and seven foreign patent applications pending as of December 31, 2011, we may be unable to obtain further meaningful patent protection for our technology.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P7_S12	In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Further, our platform incorporates open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	While we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses, and therefore the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could materially harm our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	For example, in 2010 a complaint was filed by Prompt Medical Systems, L.P. naming us and several other defendants alleging infringement of its patent with a listed issue date in 1996 entitled Method for Computing Current Procedural Terminology Codes from Physician Generated Documentation.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	For additional information regarding this litigation, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S9	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S11	In addition, we may be required to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling for such a claim.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	made by our current or former employees.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including patients of our physician clients, government agencies, or stockholders.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS We depend upon two third-party service providers for important processing functions.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If either of these third-party providers does not fulfill its contractual obligations or chooses to discontinue its services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have entered into service agreements with International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our client service operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Among other things, these providers process critical claims data and clinical documents.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If these services fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation, and operating results could be harmed.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Failure of either service provider to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves, which increases our risk.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources, and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We conduct operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, and pandemics.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, client satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain clients, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S9	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S10	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	the size or type of equity awards that job candidates require to join our company.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower than expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer than expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned revenue expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If the revenue of our clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Under most of our client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our physician clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government health care programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Also, although we currently estimate our expected customer life to be twelve years, this is only an estimate and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated on 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers, and otherwise harm our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of, audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The sales cycle for our services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Some of our new-client set-up projects are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P24_S5	In some cases, especially those involving larger clients, the sales cycle and the implementation cycle may exceed the typical ranges by substantial margins.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated expected customer life, currently twelve years, or the contract term.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	After a client contract is signed, we provide an implementation process for the client during which appropriate connections and registrations are established and checked, data is loaded into our athenaNet system, data tables are set up, and practice personnel are given initial training.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The length and details of this implementation process vary widely from client to client.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Typically, implementation of larger clients takes longer than implementation for smaller clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Implementation for a given client may be cancelled.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or for no reason in 90 days.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Despite the fact that we typically require a deposit in advance of implementation, some clients have cancelled before our services have been started.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S7	In addition, implementation may be delayed or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S8	If implementation periods are extended, our provision of the revenue cycle, clinical cycle, or patient cycle services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S9	In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the cancelled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S10	These factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P25_S11	As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which is periodically revised or expanded.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	RISKS RELATED TO OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary athenaNet application from operating properly.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If athenaNet does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us and/or attempt to cancel their contracts with us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Moreover, information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	not develop and the function of which is outside of our control.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Because changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	These defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to clients or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S6	The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P29_S7	In addition, clients relying on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We market and sell services that, among other things, provide information to assist care providers in tracking and treating ill patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby harm our business and operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our clients or their patients may assert claims against us alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our software or service processes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A product liability claim or errors or omissions claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such a claim.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	If our security measures are breached or fail, and unauthorized access is obtained to a client s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our services involve the web-based storage and transmission of clients proprietary information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce customer confidence and require substantial resources to address.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client or patient data.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P31_S5	As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We rely upon our clients as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	On occasion, our clients have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Failure of clients to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S5	In addition, our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their client data or the data of their patients on our systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	have done so and will do so.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P33_S5	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Various events could interrupt clients access to athenaNet, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The ability to access athenaNet is critical to our clients administering care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our own systems or in other systems; and (iv) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our own systems and in other systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If clients access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our services, which would adversely impact our revenues.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S7	In addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S10	Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data-hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S11	We currently serve our clients from a third-party data-hosting facility located in Bedford, Massachusetts, operated by Digital 55 Middlesex, LLC (as successor to Sentinel Properties-Bedford, LLC).
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P34_S12	In addition, in December 2009 we signed a contract with a major provider of disaster recovery services, SunGard Availability Services, LP, to store our disaster recovery plans, and provide disaster recovery testing services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In the case of a significant event at our primary data center, we could become operational in a reasonable timeframe at our backup data center.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	However, these facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our ability to deliver our Internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone, facsimile, and pager systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, we have experienced and expect that we will in the future experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P37_S5	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including database software from Oracle Corporation and storage devices from International Business Machines Corporation and EMC Corporation.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms; however, it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	While we have implemented certain features and safeguards designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Our software, content, and services are used to assist clinical decision-making and provide information about patient medical histories and treatment plans.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P41_S5	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our proprietary athenaClinicals service is utilized in clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If our athenaClinicals service fails to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of that service is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, clinicians, or patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages and to require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	We maintain general liability and insurance coverage, but this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S7	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Our proprietary software may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S9	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S10	From time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software, and such defects or errors can be expected to appear in the future.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P42_S11	Defects and errors that are not timely detected and remedied could expose us to risk of liability to clients, clinicians, and patients and cause delays in introduction of new services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, or decrease market acceptance or client satisfaction with our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We may be liable for use of incorrect or incomplete data that we provide, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We store and display data for use by health care providers in treating patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our clients or third parties provide us with most of these data.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of health care services or erroneous health information.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	While we maintain insurance coverage, we cannot assure that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P44_S6	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION Government regulation of health care creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the health care industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Many health care laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In particular, many existing health care laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the health care information services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Some of the risks we face from health care regulation are described below: False or Fraudulent Claim Laws .
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse in connection with such submission and payment.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S5	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S6	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P48_S7	The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to our clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations .
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	In addition, our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	access by the Department of Health and Human Services to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S3	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it have provided and are expected to provide clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In addition, ONCHIT is coordinating the ongoing development of national standards for creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the health care sector.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S5	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S6	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, we seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our clients, and since we do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Among our services, we provide telephone reminder services to patients, Internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We believe that reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure of individually identifiable health information have been and are being taken in connection with these services, including the use of multiple-password security.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P53_S4	However, any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and other personally identifiable information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P54_S4	We are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to health care providers and patients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	For example, the federal health care programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal health care program.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws forbid bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients, vendors, or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	For example, one aspect of our athenaCoordinator service is the preparation and submission of electronic orders from providers to other participants in the health care system (e.g., hospitals, labs, and specialists).
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As the recipients of those orders will in certain instances pay us for the submission of accurate, complete, and readable orders instead of the handwritten and often incomplete orders traditionally submitted, our service could potentially be seen as providing referrals to the order recipients in exchange for payment.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Although the Office of Inspector General issued an Advisory Opinion in November 2011 stating that our receipt of payments in such instances would not violate federal anti-kickback laws, we cannot predict whether changes in the law or our services might lead to a challenge of the legality of those services by government regulators.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	There are federal and state laws that forbid payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals and/or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with health care providers.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	of the federal laws called the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P58_S2	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws .
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	States have differing prescription format requirements, and, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Any determination that we or our clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P62_S4	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As a company that provides EHR functionality, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The software component of our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR by CCHIT, an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	hospitals for funding under the HITECH Act.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	While we believe that our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of our client s claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Although we do not determine what is billed to a payer, to the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for health care services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and timeframes may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by clients.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In addition, in February 2011 the FDA issued a final rule regarding regulation of Medical Device Data Systems (MDDSs), which are systems that are intended to transfer, store, convert, or display medical device data.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P70_S2	While EHRs are expressly exempted from the final rule, it is possible that future changes in our services could involve the transfer, storage, conversion, or display of medical device data.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P70_S3	To the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy or our software is considered an MDDS under the final rule, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Potential health care reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new services types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Our services may be significantly impacted by health care reform initiatives and are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, either of which could affect our business in a multitude of ways.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If substantive health care reform or applicable regulatory requirements are adopted, we may have to change or adapt our services and software to comply.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S5	Reform or changing regulatory requirements may also render our services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S6	This may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop services or software.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S7	For example, the conversion to the ICD-10 standard for coding medical diagnoses and the Version 5010 HIPAA standard for the transmission of electronic transactions will likely cause significant disruption to our industry and consume a large amount of resources on our part.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S8	Such reforms may also make introduction of new service types more costly or more time consuming than we currently anticipate.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P72_S9	Such changes may even prevent introduction by us of new services or make the continuation of our existing services unprofitable or impossible.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and customer service providers, International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Changes in the health care industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S4	As the health care industry evolves, changes in our client and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S5	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of health care providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S6	Such larger health care organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S7	Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S8	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S9	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S10	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S11	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S12	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P75_S13	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Other relationships permit third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In each of these cases, we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and/or limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P77_S4	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided as well as the channel relationship themselves may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P77_S5	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing wrongful or illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients, any failure to follow contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in wrongful or illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and lead analysts or investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, resulting in reduction in the market price of our stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and/or credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S5	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S6	If any of our employees or subcontractors takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S7	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S8	Potential subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S9	Recently, entities such as the Massachusetts Healthcare Consortium have offered to subsidize adoption by physicians of EHR technology.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S10	In addition, federal regulations have been changed to permit such subsidy from additional sources subject to certain limitations, and the current administration has passed the HITECH Act, which will provide federal support for EHR initiatives.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S11	To the extent that we do not qualify or participate in such subsidy programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S12	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S13	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P78_S14	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S2	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S3	If a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S4	If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S5	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 35.4 million shares of common stock outstanding.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S6	Moreover, the holders of shares of common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S7	We have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our 1997 Stock Plan, 2000 Stock Plan, 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S8	As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding options to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock (approximately 1.5 million of which were exercisable at December 31, 2011) that, if exercised, will result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.

1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S10	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P79_S11	Actual or potential sales of our stock by our employees, including members of our senior management team, pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons, and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and our policies regarding stock transactions, a number of our directors and employees, including members of our senior management team, have adopted and will continue to adopt pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell a portion of our common stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Generally, stock sales under such plans by members of our senior management team and directors require public filings.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Actual or potential sales of our stock by such persons could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P80_S3	For example, actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P80_S5	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P80_S6	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.

1131096_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P81_S2	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally an entity that, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S2	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S3	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S4	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S5	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S6	Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_12_ITEM1A_P82_S7	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.

Overview athenahealth provides business services that help medical caregivers achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more money and exercising more control over their administrative tasks.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	These services are designed to reduce the administrative burden of complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many of the related tasks that distract medical providers and staff from the practice of medicine.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud-based platform, athenaNet.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	We differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements through athenaNet to clients without any action on the part of the client.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	athenaNet enables us to quickly implement our solution at a low up-front cost and to seamlessly work in tandem with our clients in real time.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The services provided through our single-instance cloud are currently packaged as four integrated components: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management, athenaClinicals for electronic health record management, athenaCommunicator for patient communication management and athenaCoordinator for referral cycle management.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The use of our single-instance platform allows all clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of all of our other clients through our patented billing Rules Engine and our clinical Quality Management Engine.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our clients use these rules engines to monitor and benchmark their performance with peer practices across the network.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our business intelligence application, Anodyne Analytics, also supports our clients in their pursuit of financial health by equipping users with data visualization tools and insight into their practice s performance.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct components: Software, Knowledge, and Work.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The cloud-based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients, payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Knowledge is infused into each of our services via our Rules Engine as we work with clients, payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The third component to each of our services is the Work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Wherever possible, we replace manual processes with automation, but where automation is not possible, we provide that manual labor rather than returning it to clients to be completed.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	This unique service model of Software, Knowledge, and Work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance, creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	We charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases, so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	In 2011, we generated revenue of $324.1 million from the sale of our services compared to $245.5 million in 2010 and $188.5 million in 2009.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P5_S5	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P5_S6	Despite increased spending in these areas, higher revenue and lower direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue have led to greater operating income.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our revenues are predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	This revenue is generally determined as a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients, so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians working within our client accounts and the collections of these physicians and the number of services purchased.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	To provide these services, we incur expense in several categories, including direct operating, selling and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	In general, our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	Our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future, our overall business management activities, and our infrastructure.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity, in adherence to related financial covenants.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S6	Sources of Revenue We derive our revenue from two sources: from business services associated with our revenue cycle management, electronic health record management, patient communication management, care coordination and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S7	Implementation and other services consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S8	Business services accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S9	Business services fees are typically 2% to 8% of a practice s total collections depending upon the services used and the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice, plus a per-statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients of certain clients.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P6_S10	Accordingly, business services fees are largely driven by: the number of physician practices we serve, the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians and other medical providers, the services used by the practice and our contracted rates.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Additionally, the volume of activity and related collections vary from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the flu season.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	While we believe that the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season will continue to impact collections by our physician clients, there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Implementation and other revenue are largely driven by the increase in the volume of new business.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	As a result, we expect implementation and other revenue to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	None of our clients accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, or 2009.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Operating Expense Direct Operating Expense .
1131096_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits, claim processing costs, other direct costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients, including staff who implement new clients.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	We include in direct operating expense all service costs associated with athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, athenaCommunicator, athenaCoordinator and Anodyne Analytics.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	We expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation, with higher volumes of work in particular functions, geographies, and medical specialties.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	Although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future, the direct operating expense is expected in the long-term to decline as a percentage of revenues as we increase automation.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P9_S6	Additionally, in the near-term, we expect that the percentage of direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue will slightly increase until we fully integrate our newly acquired business and automate our new care coordinator offering.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), depreciation, and amortization, except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and on-line initiatives) and personnel-related expense for sales and marketing employees (including salaries, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expense).
1131096_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	We have increased our sales and marketing expenses from year to year and we expect to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel and support personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients and expand awareness through paid search and other similar initiatives.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	We also plan to expand our marketing activities in certain areas, such as attending trade shows, expanding user groups, and creating new printed materials.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	As a result, we expect that, in the near-term, sales and marketing expense will increase at the same rate as revenue growth.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses for research and development employees (including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expense) and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	We expect that, in the near-term, research and development expense will increase in absolute terms and will likely increase as a percentage of total revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees (including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expense), occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), and insurance premiums; software as a service fees; outside professional fees for accountants, lawyers, and consultants; and compensation for temporary employees.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development costs, which we amortize over a two-year period from the time of release of related software code.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	As we grow, we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business, and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	In the near-term we expect related depreciation and amortization expense to increase as a percentage of total revenue.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Interest expense has historically consisted of interest costs related to our equipment-related term leases, our term loan and revolving loans under our credit facility, offset by interest income on investments.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Interest income represents earnings from our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The gain (loss) on the interest rate derivative contract represented the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that is not designated a hedge.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	As we repaid all capital leases, the term loan and terminated the interest rate derivative contract in May 2011, we expect that our interest expense will be insignificant until such time we determined it is appropriate to draw down on our new financing arrangements.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income tax provision consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and India.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The difference between our effective tax rate and statutory rate is mainly related to the treatment of incentive Stock Options ( ISOs ) as permanent differences.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We substantially ceased issuing ISOs in 2009 and expect that the difference between the effective tax rate and our federal and state statutory rates will be nominal as the previously issued ISOs vest and possibly become disqualified dispositions.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Recent Developments On October 20, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement that provides for a five-year $100 million revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Agreement ).
1131096_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Revolving Credit Agreement replaces the $15 million credit agreement that expired September 3, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	The terms and conditions of the Revolving Credit Agreement are customary to facilities of this nature.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	On August 31, 2011, the Company acquired Proxsys LLC ( Proxsys ).
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The acquisition broadens the Company s offerings by bringing order transmission, pre-certification and pre-registration capabilities to the Company s service platform.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	The results of Proxsys s operations are included in the statement of operations of the combined entity since the date of acquisition.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	Consideration for this transaction was $28 million plus potential additional consideration of $8 million which will be paid over a two-year period if Proxsys achieves certain business and financial milestones.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we have not paid any amounts associated with the additional consideration.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S6	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S7	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S8	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P20_S9	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including our estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock options; (5) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (6) fair value of contingent consideration and acquired intangible assets and (7) litigation reserves.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	Actual results could differ from the estimates we have used.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P22_S5	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, as they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P22_S6	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We derive our revenue from business services associated with revenue cycle management, electronic health record management, patient communication management, care coordination and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that renew automatically upon completion.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenaNet, minimum fees, flat fees, or per-claim fees where applicable.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the month and delivered to clients primarily by email.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	For most of our clients, fees are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	All revenue, other than implementation revenue, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers; we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	Each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company considers a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	Further, the Company s revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company allocates arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company determines selling price using vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists; otherwise, the Company uses third party evidence ( TPE ).
1131096_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, the Company uses estimated selling price.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	We recognize our non-refundable up-front fees over the contract term or estimated expected customer life, whichever is longer.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	As the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services, we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete, at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the longer of the estimated expected customer life or contract life.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	We determined the estimated customer life considering the following key factors:
1131096_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Renewal rate considerations Economic life of the product or service Industry data The estimated customer life, or expected performance period, for the years presented is 12 years.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our estimate of expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	For example, if in the future, we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	On the other hand, if in the future, we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The amount of deferred revenue related to non-refundable up-front fees is $50.6 million as of December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Business Combinations, including purchased intangibles and contingent consideration, are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	All changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and a probability-weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results and earn-out targets related to estimating the value of the contingent considerations.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	We review acquired intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill and intangibles, acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangibles which are finite-lived assets or changes in fair value of the contingent consideration from the date of acquisition.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in the estimates of earn out results.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	We have $47.3 million and $20.1 million carrying amount of goodwill and purchased intangibles, as of December 31, 2011, respectively.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	We have a liability of $8.2 million of contingent consideration related to $13.3 million in potential payments as of December 31, 2011, related to both the Anodyne and Proxsys business combinations.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	The initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of $5.1 million related to the Anodyne acquisition in October 2009.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	To date, the Company has paid out a total of $3.6 million and adjusted the fair value by $0.2 million due to change in the assumptions, and other factors related to Anodyne.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	The balance as of December 31, 2011, was $1.4 million related to the remaining $4.2 million in potential payments related to Anodyne that will be settled in the first half of 2012.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	The initial purchase price allocation at estimated fair value of $6.8 million related to the Proxsys acquisition in August of 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P42_S6	To date, the Company has not paid out any amounts or adjusted the fair value related to Proxsys.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods shown:
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $324.1 million, an increase of $78.5 million, or 32%, over revenue of $245.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	This increase was due almost entirely to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Revenue from business services for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $312.8 million, an increase of $75.6 million, or 32%, over revenue of $237.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	This increase was primarily due to the growth in the number of physicians and other medical providers using our services.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	The summary of changes in the physicians and active medical providers using our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, electronic health records management service, athenaClinicals, and patient communication management service, athenaCommunicator are as follows: Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and medical providers.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S5	Total collections generated by these physicians and other medical providers that were posted for the year ended December 31, 2011, were $7.3 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over posted collections of $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S6	Revenue from implementations and other sources was $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $2.9 million, or 35%, over revenue of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S7	This increase was driven by new client implementations and increased professional services, including consulting services, for our larger client base.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S8	The increase in implementation and other revenue is the result of the increase in the volume of new business.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P44_S9	Direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $122.8 million, an increase of $26.2 million, or 27%, over direct operating costs of $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 mainly as a result of increased direct operating employee-related costs and business partner services.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 59.3 million, an increase of 11.9 million, or 25% over total claims submitted of 47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Direct operating employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased $14.4 million, or 27%, from $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	This increase is primarily due to the 21% increase in headcount since December 31, 2010, which does not include the approximately 200 employees from our acquisition of Proxsys at the end of August 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	Not including our acquisition of Proxsys, we increased headcount to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base has expanded and includes larger medical groups.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	Also, for the year ended December 31, 2011, direct operating expense includes $36.5 million of business partners services, an increase of $8.3 million, or 29% compared to $28.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	Selling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $79.8 million, an increase of $27.1 million, or 51%, over costs of $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P45_S6	This increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, internal sales commissions and external partner channel commission of $15.2 million, or 44%, from $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our sales and marketing headcount increased 39% since December 31, 2010, as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase was also due to a $8.6 million increase in sales and marketing programs to drive leads, meetings and awareness and $3.2 million increase in travel-related expenses, consulting, and other marketing expenses.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $23.3 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 27%, over research and development expense of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	This increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $4.1 million, or 25%, from $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	This increase is due in part to a 31% increase in headcount from December 31, 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technology, as well as an overall increase in salaries for technical resources.

1131096_12_ITEM7_P53_S8	Our general and administrative headcount increased by 6% since December 31, 2009, as we added personnel to support our growth.

1131096_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	The loss was the result of the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that was not designated as a hedge instrument under the authoritative guidance.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	Although this derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that the instrument is closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus managing the associated risk.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	We recorded a provision of $10.4 million for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010 based upon an effective tax rate of 45% compared to a provision of $8.8 million for the income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 based upon an effective tax rate of 49%.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to a decrease in our state tax rate and a decrease in the effect of our permanent differences as percent of the overall rate.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity We initially funded our growth primarily through the private sale of equity securities, totaling approximately $50.6 million, as well as through long-term debt, working capital, equipment-financing loans, and, in September 2007, we completed our initial public offering which provided net proceeds of approximately $81.3 million.

1131096_12_ITEM7_P57_S5	As of December 31, 2011, we have no outstanding indebtedness.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P57_S6	In October 2011, we entered into a $100 million five-year, revolving credit agreement.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P57_S7	The credit facility may be extended by up to an additional $100 million on the satisfaction of certain covenants, including consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charges coverage ratios.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The interest rates applicable to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement are at either (i) the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an interest margin based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an interest margin based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company paid a $0.7 million commitment fee.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to finance our strategic initiatives, make payments on our contractual obligations, and our purchases of property and equipment for the foreseeable future.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Our analysis is supported by the growth in our new customer base and a high rate of renewal rates with our existing customers and the corresponding increase in billings and collections.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	We may pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies, in which case we may need to borrow against our revolving credit facility.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facility or obtain additional financing.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Commitments We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the year 2012.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.

1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase is mainly attributable to increases in net income and cash provided in changes in operating assets and liabilities.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The increase in net income is primarily due to the growth in customer bases, stability in renewal rates with our existing customer base and increased adoption of our services.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	This increase is partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries, higher commissions, direct operating expenses, and selling and marketing expenses.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S4	The increase in add-backs of non-cash expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011, from December 31, 2010 are primarily due to increases in amortization and depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S5	This is offset by a non-cash adjustment related to the excess tax benefits from stock-based awards; thereby presenting total operating activities as if we had paid higher cash taxes.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S6	The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributed to capital expenditures and the acquisition of the Point Lookout facility in June 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S7	The increase in stock-based compensation expense is primarily due to the increase in the volume and the value of stock-based awards granted during 2011 over grants in 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S8	The increase to cash provided by in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2011, was due in large part to the increase in our deferred revenue offset by an increase in accounts receivable and decrease in deferred rent.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S9	Accounts receivable increase to $49.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $36.9 million at December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S10	The increase can be attributed to the overall increase in revenue and the timing of current billings and subsequent payment of those billings as of December 31, 2011, compared to the same period and timing as of December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S11	The increase in accrued expenses of $10.9 million is due to higher accrued sales commissions due to the timing of new deals and accrued bonus mainly driven by an increase in headcount of 45%.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S12	The decrease in deferred rent is related to the repayment of rental incentive loans in the amount of $2.1 million.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P61_S13	The $11.8 million impact from changes in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated statements of cash flows compared to the $2.2 million increase in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets is mainly a result of being in an income tax receivable position with a $13.8 million net tax benefit non-cash transaction associated with our stock-based compensation exercises.
1131096_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The cash used by investing activities stayed relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2011, at $53.2 million compared to $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

1131096_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	We elected to repay all of our outstanding debt balances under our equipment line of credit and term loan, as well as terminate our related interest rate derivative which resulted in a decrease in cash of $9.7 million.

1131096_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, less than 1% of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in Chennai, India, and was incurred in Indian rupees.
1131096_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial.
1131096_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and total available-for-sale investments totaling $138.5 million at December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM7A_P1_S4	These amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits, money market funds, and available for sale, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.
1131096_12_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Due to the short and expected term of these investments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates.
1131096_12_ITEM7A_P1_S6	The value of these securities, however, will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise.

1131096_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

1131096_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Our management, including our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In conducting this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.

1131096_12_ITEM9A_P2_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P2_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P2_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_12_ITEM9A_P3_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1131096_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	Watertown, Massachusetts We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P19_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P19_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P19_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_12_ITEM15_P19_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P20_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P20_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P20_S4	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General athenahealth, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our ) is a business services company that provides ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services to its customers.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	The Company provides these services with the use of athenaNet, a proprietary Internet-based practice management application.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company s customers consist of medical group practices ranging in size throughout the United States of America.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P22_S2	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including the estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock-based compensation; (5) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (6) fair value of identifiable purchased tangible and intangible assets and contingent consideration in a business combination and (7) litigation reserves.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the customer, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company derives its revenue from business services fees, implementation fees, and other services.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P24_S2	Business services fees include amounts charged for ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services and are generally billed to the customer as a percentage of total collections.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P24_S3	The Company does not recognize revenue for business services fees until these collections are made, as the services fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P24_S4	Business services fees also include amounts charged to customers for generating and mailing patient statements and are recognized as the related services are performed.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P24_S5	Implementation revenue consists primarily of professional services fees related to assisting customers with the implementation of the Company s services and are generally billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation is complete and then recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be twelve years.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P24_S6	The Company evaluates the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on our experience with customer contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those customers will receive benefits from our current portfolio of services.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P25_S2	Other services consist primarily of training, consulting services and interface fees and are recognized as the services are performed.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	considers a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Further, the Company s revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	The appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company allocates arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company determines selling price using vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists; otherwise, the Company uses third party evidence ( TPE ).
1131096_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, the Company uses estimated selling price.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients; claims processing costs; implementing new clients; and other direct costs related to collection and business services.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	Costs associated with the implementation of new clients are expensed as incurred.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P30_S2	The reported amounts of direct operating expenses do not include allocated amounts for rent and overhead costs (which are included in general and administrative costs), and depreciation and amortization (which are broken out separately on the statement of operations), except for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	All such costs are expensed as incurred.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and other liquid securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	Investments Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase based upon management s intent with regard to such investments.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	Scheduled maturity dates of U.S. government backed securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, within one year of that date are classified as short-term.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Scheduled maturity dates of U.S. government backed securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, in excess of one year are classified as long-term.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	Investments included in long-term other assets on the consolidated balance sheet include $18.6 million of U.S. government backed securities at December 31, 2011 and $3.5 million of U.S. government backed securities and $2.1 million of commercial paper at December 31, 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P33_S3	All investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P33_S4	There were no material realized gains and losses on sales of these investments for the periods presented.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company determines realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represents amounts due from customers for subscription and implementation services.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts, which are determined by establishing reserves for specific accounts and consideration of historical and estimated probable losses.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
1131096_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	The other financial instruments approximate their fair value, primarily because of their short-term nature.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Derivative financial instruments have been used to manage certain of the Company s interest rate exposures.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes, nor does the Company hold or issue any financial instruments for trading purposes.

1131096_12_ITEM15_P42_S2	The airplane and land improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over 20 years and 10 years, respectively.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the asset carrying value.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P44_S2	Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P44_S3	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, or 2009.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of $4.2 million in escrowed amounts relating to the purchase of Anodyne (see Note 2) as of December 31, 2011.

1131096_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	Costs related to the preliminary project stage of subsequent versions of athenaNet or other technologies are expensed as incurred.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	Costs incurred in the application development stage are capitalized, and such costs are amortized over the software s estimated economic life.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	The estimated useful life of the software is two years.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P46_S4	Amortization expense was $4.4 million, $2.6 million, and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P46_S5	Future amortization expense for all software development costs capitalized as of December 31, 2011, is estimated to be $4.9 million and $2.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2012, and 2013, respectively.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	The Company evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	If the fair value of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P48_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	Purchased Intangibles Purchased intangibles consist of technology, non-compete agreements and customer relationships acquired in connection with business acquisitions and are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company concluded that use of the straight-line method was appropriate as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Accrued expenses and accrued compensation Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of rent escalation payment terms, tenant improvement allowances and other incentives received from landlords related to the Company s operating leases for its facilities.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Rent escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which is recorded by the Company over the term of the lease, including any construction period.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord as part of the negotiated terms of the lease or reimbursements of moving costs.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	These cash payments are recorded as deferred rent from landlords and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense, over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	Deferred revenue includes certain deferred implementation services fees which are recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be twelve years.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company applies business combination accounting when they have acquired control over one or more businesses.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	Business Combinations are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	The associated acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; non-controlling interests, if any, are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development ( IPR D ), if any, is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination, if any, are generally expensed rather than capitalized; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will affect income tax expense; and goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	We have applied this acquisition method to the transactions described in Note 2.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, and accounts receivable.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company attempts to limit its credit risk associated with cash equivalents, investments by investing in highly rated corporate and financial institutions, and engaging with highly rated financial institutions as a counterparty to its derivative transaction.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	With respect to customer accounts receivable, the Company manages its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its customers.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues or accounts receivable as of or for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, or 2009.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	Our income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the balance sheet date to be recognized in the related period.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company s policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Sales and Use Taxes The Company s services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company s contractual agreements with its customers provide that payment of any sales or use taxes assessments are the responsibility of the customer.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	In certain jurisdictions sales taxes are collected from the customer and remitted to the respective agencies.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P63_S3	These taxes are recorded on a net basis and excluded from revenue and expense in our financial statements as presented.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief decision-maker ( CODM ), or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company, which uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has determined that it operates in one segment and the CODM uses non-GAAP operating income (defined as Operating Income as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Operations less total stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense related to purchased intangibles for the period) as the measure of the Company s profit on a regular basis.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company accounts for share-based awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, and share-based awards with compensation cost measured using the fair value of the awards issued.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value share-based awards and determine the related compensation expense.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company generally issues previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options; however the Company may reissue previously acquired treasury shares to satisfy these issuances in the future.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	The financial position and results of operations of the Company s foreign subsidiary are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P67_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P67_S3	Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded within other comprehensive (loss) income.

1131096_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	The final cash payment amount was subject to a working capital adjustment which was finalized during the quarter ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as an element of purchase price with subsequent adjustments recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	The contingent consideration is discussed in Note 4.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	The fair values assigned to the contingent consideration and the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	We finalized those valuations during the quarter ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	The fair value assigned to the purchased intangible related to customer relationships increased by $1.0 million as of the acquisition date as a result of this measurement period adjustment with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of $1.0 million.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	The related impact on the amortization recognized from that date is insignificant to the statement of operations.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P72_S4	The following table summarizes the recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
1131096_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	The intangibles are being amortized between 2-10 years, with customer lists being amortized over 10 years.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	The goodwill resulting from the acquisition arises largely from the synergies expected from combining the operations of the acquisition with our existing service operations, as well as from the benefits derived from the assembled workforce of the acquisition.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	The goodwill recognized is deductible for tax purposes.

1131096_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	On October 16, 2009, the Company acquired Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. ( Anodyne ), a software enabled service business intelligence company based in Alpharetta, Georgia.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Company believes that the acquisition of Anodyne provides the Company with expanded service offerings that will better enable it to compete in the large medical group market.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Anodyne software as a service business intelligence tool enhances customers ability to view all facets of its revenue cycle information and to access and extract critical operational and administrative information from various data systems.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company used existing cash to fund the acquisition of Anodyne, following which Anodyne became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

1131096_12_ITEM15_P79_S4	The following table summarizes the total consideration transferred on the acquisition date:
1131096_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	The following table summarizes the recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
1131096_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company does not consider these acquisitions above to be material to its consolidated results of operations and is therefore not presenting pro forma financial information of revenue and operations.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company has also determined that the presentation of the results of revenue and operations for each of these acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable and immaterial.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and warrants.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S3	Under the treasury stock method, dilutive securities are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the periods and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S4	Securities are excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S5	The following table reconciles the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S6	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 0.8 million and 0.9 million options and restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P82_S7	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 1.0 million options for the year ended December 31, 2009, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their estimated fair values because of their short term nature of these financial instruments.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	Included in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, are money market fund investments of $33.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, which are reported at fair value.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	At December 31, 2010, the carrying amounts of the Company s debt obligations approximate fair value based upon our best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar debt obligations.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been or will be realized in the future.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The following table presents information about the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities obtained from readily available pricing sources for similar instruments.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	The fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable values which are supported by little or no market activity.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets or similar securities.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	The interest rate swap derivative is valued using observable inputs at the reporting date.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	It is the Company s policy to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period however there have been no such transfers during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as an element of purchase price with subsequent adjustments recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P87_S3	At the acquisition date and reporting date, the fair value of the accrued contingent consideration was determined using a probability-weighted income approach based on upside, downside and base case scenarios.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P87_S4	This approach is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which are referred to as Level 3 inputs.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has accrued a liability of $8.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, for the estimated fair value of contingent considerations estimated to be payable upon the acquired company reaching specific performance metrics over a specific period of operations after acquisition.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	The elements that make up the contingent consideration are as follows:

1131096_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	For grants issued during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the expected option term reflects the application of the simplified method.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	The simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches.
1131096_12_ITEM15_P113_S2	This methodology was utilized due to the short length of time our common stock had been publicly traded.

1131096_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on August 21, 1997, as Athena Healthcare Incorporated.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	We changed our name to athenahealth.com, Inc. on March 31, 2000, and to athenahealth, Inc. on November 17, 2000.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts, 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Overview athenahealth provides cloud-based business services that help med ical care givers collect more revenue and greatly reduce the trouble and inconvenience of their administrative tasks.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	Through a com bination of three distinct but interconnected components cloud-based software, networked knowledge, and back-office work athenahealth enables its providers to achieve and sustain financial health while keeping their focus on quality patient care.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our services are designed to reduce the burden presented by complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many of the related tasks that distract medical care givers and staff from delivering care.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	improvements to clients via our cloud-based network, athenaNet, requiring no action by the client.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Since athenaNet is web-based, our staff can quickly and seamlessly implement our services at a low up-front start-up cost to clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our cloud-based services are currently packaged as four integrated offerings: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management, athenaClinicals for clinical cycle management, athenaCommunicator for patient cycle management, and athenaCoordinator for referral cycle management.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	Our single-instance platform allows every client to benefit from the collective knowledge of all other clients through our patented billing Rules Engine and clinical Quality Management Engine, collectively called athenaRules.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P3_S4	This powerful, shared knowledge enables our clients to monitor and benchmark their performances against those of peer practices across the network.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P3_S5	Our comprehensive business intelligence application, Anodyne Analytics, together with the services of our newest su bsidiary, Healthcare Data Services LLC, further support our clients goal of financial health by equipping them with data analysis and visualization tools an d actionable insight into their performance and the health of their patient populations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	The software offered via athenaNet is the primary conduit through which we exchange information among clients, payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Expert knowledge is infused into each service via athenaRules as we work with clients, payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each service also benefits from back-office administrative work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	We automate these processes whenever possible, but, when automation cannot be implemented, we perform the work ourselves rather than returning it to clients to be completed.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	This unique service model of Software, Knowledge, and Work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance, creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S5	We charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases, so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue for them.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S6	In 2000, we released our first service offering, athenaCollector, and followed with athenaClinicals in 2006.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S7	athenaCommunicator, introduced in 2010, represents the integration and rebranding of our first acquisition, Crest Line Technologies, LLC (d.b.a. MedicalMessaging.net).
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S8	We continued this expansion of our offerings in October, 2009, with our acquisition of Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. ( Anodyne ), the privately held company that developed the Anodyne Analytics service.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S9	In August, 2011, to further accelerate the development of our emerging care coordination service, we acquired Proxsys LLC ( Proxsys ), a leading provider of cloud-based care coordination services between physicians and hospitals.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S10	Finally, in October 2012 we acquired Healthcare Data Services LLC, which offers patient population health management services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P4_S11	In 2012, we generated revenue of $422.3 million from the sale of our services, compared to $324.1 million in 2011.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , there were 39,752 medical providers, including 28,011 physicians, using our athenaCollector service across 47 states and the District of Columbia and 77 medical specialties.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	The health care industry is complex and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that do not offer the core competencies of collaboration, flexibility, and interoperability.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	A disproportionate amount of communication still takes place on paper instead of via automated communications.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	This combination of outdated, inflexible systems and paper workflows creates significant costs for health care organizations, which suffer sizable administrative work, as well as duplication and errors.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	By addressing these problems head on, medical care givers can free their staff to focus on the practice of medicine.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	While the fee-for-service reimbursement framework is fraught with complexity for medical practices, managed care plans typically are even more complex, creating reimbursement structures that are more complicated than previous methods, with greater responsibility placed on care givers to capture and provide appropriate data to obtain payments.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	This reality is further complicated by newer, emerging reimbursement models such as Pay-For-Reporting, Pay-For-Performance, and Shared Savings.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	These programs require care givers to identify programs for which they are eligible, enroll in those programs, identify eligible patients, and record relevant billing and clinical data for each eligible encounter.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, care givers may be penalized for non-reporting or non-participation in these programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	Many of these programs also require a much greater focus on care coordination and cost efficiency across multiple care givers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P6_S5	Practice-based activities required to ensure appropriate payment for services rendered have increased in number and complexity for the following reasons:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Legislative reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, that was signed into law in March 2010, is expected to drive many fundamental shifts in the health care reimbursement landscape.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Millions of additional patients could be required to purchase health insurance coverage, and private payers may have to limit percentages of non-clinical expenses as a portion of their revenues.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	Payers abilities to raise insurance premiums will likely also be regulated, forcing them to focus on other ways of improving their financial performance, including new contracting options for physicians and new programs to identify preventable costs.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	of these programs would require the aggregation and exchange of clinical data in order to ensure continuity of care for each patient.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Diversity of health benefit plan design .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Health insurers have introduced a wide range of benefit structures, many of which are customized to the unique goals of particular employer groups.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	This has resulted in an increase in rules regarding who is eligible for health care services, what health care services are eligible for reimbursement, and who is responsible to pay for health care services delivered.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	It has also resulted in more plans that require a larger portion of patient responsibility, such as High Deductible Health Plans ( HDHP ) or plans with little coverage other than negotiated discounts; these increase the burden on practices to manage and pursue receivables directly with the patient.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Dynamic nature of health benefit plan design .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Health insurers continually update their reimbursement rules based on ongoing monitoring of consumption patterns, in response to new medical products and procedures, and to address changing employer demands.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	As these changes are made frequently throughout the year and are often specific to each individual health plan, practices need to be continually aware of this dynamic element of the reimbursement cycle, as it could impact overall reimbursement and specific workflows.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Proliferation of new payment models .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	New health benefit plans and reimbursement structures have considerably modified the ways in which medical practices are paid.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Care-based initiatives like Pay-for-Performance, which provide reimbursement incentives related to the capture and submission of specified clinical information, have dramatically increased the administrative and clinical documentation burden of the medical practice.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	Shared Savings programs like Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, reward care givers for managing care in a cost-efficient way; this requires greater coordination of clinical effort across medical practices and their trading partners.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	These newer models continue to evolve and grow in both number and complexity.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Financial incentives continue to spur on EHR purchasing activity .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	The federal government enacted a financial incentive program through the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act ) for care givers who demonstrate Meaningful Use of a certified Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) technology.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	While payments under the program do not represent a sustained market opportunity, they have shifted buying patterns since they were instituted, with many care givers accelerating their purchase of EHRs and making revenue cycle decisions tied to an EHR selection.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	We expect that these payments, together with reductions in Medicare reimbursement that will be imposed starting in 2015 for failure to demonstrate Meaningful Use, will continue to drive EHR adoption.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	In addition to administering typical business functions, care givers must invest significant time and resources processing inbound and outbound communications related to physician orders, including referrals to specialists, imaging centers, laboratories, pharmacies, and inpatient admissions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	In order to process these communications, medical practices often interact with multiple software systems; execute paper-based and fax-based communications to and from payers and other trading partners; and contact patients, payers, and other trading partners to effectively communicate the appropriate clinical information to accompany the order.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	All of this work must be conducted to ensure that the patient receives appropriate care and the procedure is eligible for reimbursement.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our mission is to be medical care givers most trusted service, helping them do well, doing the right thing.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	In almost all cases, we price our services as a percentage of practice collections, which incentivizes us to improve organization performance while simultaneously reducing cost through more efficient operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	As practices face rising costs, greater complexity, and changing reimbursement rates, they need solutions for a diverse set of problems.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	These problems include increased administrative work required to manage new reimbursement models; greater demand from trading partners and Shared Savings program members for electronic data exchange; pressure to adopt expensive EHRs; continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards; new insurance payer rules; more complicated reimbursement structures; and increased work to collect self-pay balances from uninsured, underinsured, and HDHP patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that traditional, locally installed software fails to address all of these needs, solving only a subset of problems that can be managed through electronic storage and data transmission, without allowing for intelligent evolution of the functionality.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	Locally installed software also favors larger organizations that can afford an up-front investment in hardware and software, as well as the staff to manage and maintain these systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	Cloud-based software can solve a greater set of these problems particularly when implemented in a single instance because it can be quickly updated and delivered to all clients without expensive upgrades or new hardware installation.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P18_S5	However, there remain many challenges that even cloud-based software alone cannot address without a corresponding service component.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P18_S6	Examples include processing and sorting all incoming paper documents that a practice receives; identifying and managing payer rules; identifying and enrolling care givers in Pay-For-Performance programs; selecting and alerting care givers to Pay-for-Performance measures for specific patients; and taking patient phone calls with a live operator when a practice is closed.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	service operations that can achieve a comparative advantage by executing work at scale that would otherwise fall upon the practice.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	The electronic connectivity and system infrastructure that we provide would normally be out of reach for small independent practices, which make up a large portion of the care giver market.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	However, because we automate processes and scale work across our entire provider network, we can efficiently deliver our services to medical practices of every size.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	By enabling small practices to receive the same level of technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefit not only to practices but also to all of their trading partners and fellow Shared Savings program members.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	As practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility will enhance our ability to compete, regardless of whether the practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	Key elements of our strategy include:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Remaining intensely focused on our clients success .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our business model aligns our goals with our clients goals, providing us with an ongoing incentive to improve client performance.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	We believe that this approach enables us to maintain client loyalty (demonstrated through high and sustained client satisfaction and retention), enhance our reputation, and improve the quality of our solutions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Integration of revenue cycle, clinical cycle, patient cycle, and referral cycle .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	As payment models continue to integrate cost efficiency and performance into reimbursement formulas, activities that previously were not factors in reimbursement will become more important in driving practice performance.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Only practices that control these activities in a way that is fully integrated with their revenue cycle will have visibility into their true financial health.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Some examples might be care hand-offs between physicians and trading partners, care coordination to prevent duplicate procedures, patient adherence reminders, and closed-loop prescription and lab order management.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	We proactively demonstrate to practices how, when fully adopted and optimized, our integrated services athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, athenaCommunicator, and athenaCoordinator can help medical care givers manage and monitor performance comprehensively.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our Rules Engine leverages our single-instance platform to allow all clients to benefit from knowledge across the network.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	We actively seek out new revenue opportunities for practices and use the Rules Engine to deliver the right information to the right person at the right time.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	For athenaCollector clients, these rules are introduced during charge entry and claim submission to alert users to any errors or omissions; this increases the percentage of transactions that are successfully executed on the first attempt and reduces the time it takes to fully resolve claims or other transactions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	We continually build our centralized payer reimbursement rules by learning from the collective experience of our national network of clients, as well as through proactive outreach to payers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	The rules embedded in athenaClinicals are becoming increasingly tied to reimbursement as more Pay-for-Reporting, Pay-for-Performance, shared savings, and other bonus payments require specific action at the point of care.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The athenaClinicals workflow allows customizable alerts to surface during the encounter to ensure that the proper quality measures are being prompted.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	Without the type of automation found in our Quality Management Engine, these payment programs would plague physicians with an administrative burden, significantly impairing their ability to practice.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Increasing awareness and attracting new clients .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe that our cloud-based business services provide significant value for medical practices of any size, and we continue to expand sales and marketing efforts to address our market opportunity and aggressively seek new clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our athenaCollector client base currently represents approximately four percent of the addressable U.S. market, comprised of an estimated 674,000 physicians practicing in the ambulatory segment.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	In addition to our traditional marketing efforts targeted at small and group practices, we have introduced several new programs to reach hospitals, health systems, and health services companies to help them manage their affiliated and employed physician strategies.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Uncovering and delivering new sources of revenue to clients .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	We have worked closely with payers and other health care trading partners to demonstrate the process efficiencies and reduction in administrative work that our services provide to medical practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	We believe that, as these trading partners gain greater understanding of these advantages and related system-wide benefits, they will continue to reward these efficiencies in a manner that accrues direct benefits for our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	High levels of user adoption and network transparency .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	One of the biggest challenges for traditional EHR software vendors has been lack of physician adoption.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	While adoption is increasing, many physicians have not used software templates to habitually document encounters and fear that EHRs will slow them down.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	Traditional documentation styles such as paper or dictation are preferred in many cases.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	Due to our large service operation, we can support many alternate documentation styles that are not available with software-only solutions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P30_S4	For example, physicians can continue to document on paper and transmit that document to us to be processed and attached to the patient chart.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P30_S5	By supporting multiple work styles and integrating these activities into the complete revenue, clinical, patient, and referral cycles, our clients realize significant benefits by using our EHR, which drives our high adoption rate.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	and the associated drivers of each.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We can then share this intelligence on the measures that correlate with, or drive, practice performance with our entire network of clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our Solutions Our service offerings are based on our proprietary cloud-based software, a continually updated database of rules, and integrated back-office service operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Our services are designed to help our clients achieve faster reimbursement from all parties, reduce error rates, increase collections, lower operating costs, improve operational workflow controls, improve coordination of care, and more efficiently manage clinical and billing information.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our principal offering, athenaCollector, is our revenue cycle management service.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	It automates and manages billing-related functions for medical practices and includes a practice management platform.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	athenaCollector assists our clients with the proper handling of claims and billing processes to help manage reimbursement quickly and efficiently.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	Complementing athenaCollector is our business intelligence offering, Anodyne Analytics, which provides physicians and practice managers with comprehensive, detailed insight into practice performance, and Healthcare Data Services, which offers practices a better understanding of the cost and quality of the care they provide to their patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Through athenaNet, athenaCollector utilizes the Internet to connect medical practices to our Rules Engine and service operations team.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	athenaCollector is a complete practice management system that includes scheduling, payment processing, and a workflow dashboard.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	The system is used by our clients and our services team to track claims requiring edits in real-time before they are sent to the payer, claims requiring work that have come back from the payer unpaid, and claims that are being held up due to administrative steps required by the individual client.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	This web-native functionality provides our clients with the benefits of our payer rules database as it is updated and enables them to interact with our services team to efficiently monitor workflows.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	Each transaction runs through our centralized Rules Engine so preventable mistakes can be corrected quickly across all of our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P34_S4	We also include a full set of reporting tools in athenaNet, so that users can track their ongoing performance and benchmark it against other practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	With the acquisition of Anodyne in October 2009, we expanded the business intelligence function of our existing services through the addition of Anodyne Analytics.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	that data visually through a wide array of business performance metrics.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	These metrics can be provided either as broad, practice-wide summaries or as discrete, highly specific analyses based on complex user-defined requests.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	As a complement to Anodyne s business intelligence services, in October 2012 we added population-based cost and quality data analysis and reporting capabilities to our line of offerings through the acquisition of Healthcare Data Services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P35_S4	These newly added services gather claims, health plan administrative, and clinical data from client health care organizations and combine those data into a single data asset that can be used by the client to coordinate care, reduce health care utilization, and address gaps in care across its patient population.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P35_S5	This enables clients to participate more effectively in new payment models offered by the U.S. government and commercial health plans, which aim to create a reimbursement system that links care reimbursement to the quality of care delivered and, ultimately, to reduce overall health care expenses for patient populations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P35_S6	In the future, we plan to further leverage the additional detail and analysis offered by Anodyne Analytics and our Healthcare Data Services offerings to visually present other data sets, such as clinical and patient cycle metrics.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Knowledge (athenaRules) Medical practices route all of their day-to-day electronic and paper-based payer communications to us, which we then process using our patented billing Rules Engine and service operations to avoid reimbursement delays and improve practice performance.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our proprietary database of payer knowledge has been constructed based on over twelve years of experience in handling the physician workflow in thousands of medical practices, with medical claims from tens of thousands of health benefit packages.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	The core focus of the database is on the payer rules, which are the key drivers of claim payment and denials.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	Understanding denials allows us to construct rules to avoid future denials across our entire client base, resulting in increased automation of our workflow processes.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	On average, over 150 rules are added to or revised in our Rules Engine each month.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	athenaRules has been designed to interact seamlessly with athenaNet in the medical office workflow and with our service operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Work (athenahealth Service Operations) athenahealth service operations enable the service teams that collaborate with client staff to achieve successful transactions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	associated with proper handling of physician claims and clinical data management.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	The service operations team is comprised of more than 1,000 people who interact with physicians, providers, and clinicians at all of the key steps in the revenue cycle, including:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	providing proactive and responsive client support to manage issues, address questions, identify training needs, and communicate trends.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	athenaClinicals athenaClinicals is our EHR service, which automates and manages medical-record-management-related functions for practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	It assists medical groups with the proper handling of physician documentation, orders, and related inbound and outbound communications to ensure that orders are carried out quickly and accurately.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	athenaClinicals is designed to improve clinical administrative workflow.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	Software (athenaNet) Through athenaNet, athenaClinicals displays key clinical measures, by office location related to the drivers of high quality and efficient care delivery, on a workflow dashboard, including lab results requiring review, patient referral requests, prescription requests, and family history of previous exams.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	athenaClinicals is a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR technology and has been certified by the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology ( CCHIT ), an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Similar to its functionality within athenaCollector, athenaNet provides comprehensive reporting on a range of clinical results, including distribution of different procedure codes (leveling), incidence of different diagnoses, timeliness of turnaround by lab companies and other intermediaries, and other key performance indicators.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Knowledge (athenaRules) Reporting and quality programs have collectively become a greater portion of physician revenue but are very difficult to manage on paper or in a static software system, where the user is not prompted for the appropriate action to be taken.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Clinical data must be captured according to the requirements and incentives of different payers and plans.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Clinical intermediaries such as laboratories and pharmacy networks require specific formats and data elements, as well.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	athenaRules is designed to access medication formularies, identify potential medication errors (such as drug-to-drug interactions or allergy reactions), and identify the specific clinical activities that are required to adhere to Pay-for-Performance programs, including Medicare incentive payments under the HITECH Act.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Work (athenahealth Service Operations) Medical practices that use an EHR still receive large amounts of paper documentation from third parties.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	These can include consult letters, lab results, general correspondence, and multiple other document types.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	Practices can receive an average of over 1,000 clinical documents per provider per month, creating a significant administrative burden.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our service operations capture inbound paper documents, convert them to electronic format, attach them to the appropriate patient chart, classify them according to type, and associate results with the original order where applicable.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Additionally, even if the physician creates an order in the EHR, the intended recipient may not accept orders electronically; in that case, we reduce the electronically generated order to paper for delivery on behalf of the practice.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We also perform many of the Pay-for-Performance program identification and enrollment tasks on behalf of practices so that they can participate without significant up-front research and effort.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	athenaCommunicator Through athenaNet, athenaCommunicator which includes ReminderCall (part of the acquisition of Crest Line Technologies, LLC in September 2008) and other automated patient messaging services, live operator services, and a patient portal was commercially released in the first half of 2010.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	These services help reduce patient no-show rates and improve overall schedule density, which increases the number of revenue-generating appointments for our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	The ability to increase patient outreach also helps provide clinical education and adherence reminders to patients, which increases the quality of care and improves outcomes without increasing practice demand to monitor and contact patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	Reminders may also be used to drive collection of patient self-pay balances.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	Together, these services provide a personalized, high-quality experience for patients while driving practice performance.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Software (athenaNet) athenaCommunicator allows practices to manage many patient communication tasks electronically, including use of automated reminder calls with customizable criteria and opt-out functionality; creation of a self-service patient portal for registration, appointment requests, bill payments, and general communication; automatic generation of emails to patients; and patient education tools.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	The automated phone calls are multi- purpose and may include appointment reminders, outbound campaigns, and follow-up on outstanding balances while prompting patients to make payments by mail, telephone, or online through our systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Knowledge (athenaRules) athenaCommunicator allows practices to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	They can set patient or group-specific communication preferences that will automatically tailor communications to the preferred timing and mode of delivery, including phone call, e-mail, or patient portal.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	These communication rules allow each patient to receive a personalized experience, including delivery of messages with branding and using the Caller ID of the practice, if desired.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Practices spend a great deal of time fielding phone calls from patients on topics ranging from scheduling requests, bill payment, directions, and clinical cases.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	As part of the athenaCommunicator service, we provide live operators who field these calls on behalf of practices, including redirected automated calls for appointment scheduling, patient payments, and message-taking.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	We also print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of the practice to assist with patient payment collection.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	Collectively, these activities expand the availability of the office to patients and help free staff to focus on more critical tasks.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	The result of athenahealth s acquisition of Proxsys LLC in August 2011, athenaCoordinator is a referral cycle management tool that helps streamline the disorganized system of patient care coordination.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	The connections between practices and points of patient referral are rife with inefficiencies due to patient data redundancies, manual inputs, and errors, resulting in additional practice workload and patient dissatisfaction.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	With athenaCoordinator, care givers can efficiently deliver a clean referral order to a physician, hospital, or other supply-chain partner.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	This much-needed improvement in today s health care reduces unnecessary phone calls and faxes, eliminates redundancies, and greatly reduces both the error rate and patient frustration.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Software (athenaNet) athenaCoordinator allows providers, via an easy-to-use online portal, to electronically prepare and send a clean order for a referral meaning all the pertinent information needed to streamline care coordination is complete and a patient can arrive at his or her appointment with another physician, or at a hospital or lab, with information already entered and verified.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	This information can include the order details, the patient s insurance eligibility, any necessary pre-certification, information the receiving provider needs to fulfill and bill the order, and details on any prior authorizations that are needed.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	This type of efficient information transfer delivers benefits to both the referring and receiving providers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	For the initial care giver, athenaCoordinator reduces time spent managing outbound orders and can provide greater visibility to patient status after the referring visit.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	For the receiving care giver, athenaCoordinator reduces denials, the time spent processing referrals, and the risk of acting on erroneous information.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P56_S5	Referring providers who use athenaClinicals can also receive a detailed care summary of the referral, effectively closing the loop of patient care.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	As part of a streamlined path of coordinated care information, athenahealth s powerful, cloud-based Rules Engine automatically determines a patient s insurance eligibility after a referring provider enters an order via the web-based portal.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	his or her coverage eligibility already confirmed.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Both the patient and the receiving hospital or lab staff can then focus on care and not get bogged down with insurance eligibility research at the point of care.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	Preparing referral orders can often require office staff to spend time managing administrative duties and they ll often not receive follow-up information after a patient has visited a referred lab, physician, or hospital.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	As part of athenaCoordinator, athenahealth staff takes over this work, benefitting both the referring and receiving providers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P58_S4	athenahealth back-office operations will verify insurance and benefits with payers, secure pre-certification, handle patient registration, collect self-pay from the patient, and electronically deliver the order to the receiving provider in advance of the patient visit.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Research and Development Our research and development efforts focus on enhancing our service offerings in response to changes in the market and evolving our technology platform to better serve medical practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	All of our clients use the same version of our software, although some athenaRules are designed to take effect locally for particular clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	We continually update our software and rules and execute bimonthly releases of new software functionality for our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S3	Our software development life cycle methodology ensures that each software release is properly designed, built, tested, and rolled out.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S4	Our software development technologists are primarily located in the United States; we complement this team s work with software development services from third-party technology development providers in Huntsville, Alabama; Pune, India; and Tver, Russia, as well as our own employees at our development center operated through our subsidiary in Chennai, India.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S5	In addition to our core software development activities, we dedicate full-time staff to our ongoing development and maintenance of the rules database.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S6	On average, over 150 rules are added or revised in our billing Rules Engine each month.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S7	We also employ program management and product management personnel, who work continually on improvements to our service operations processes and our service design, respectively.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S8	The team behind athenaRules is based in Watertown, Massachusetts, and is supported by employees at all of our locations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S9	This team is responsible for creating the billing rules that alert clients to potential problems on claims and for the creation of the clinical rules that alert clinical staff to quality measures applicable to particular patients and encounters.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P59_S10	Some key metrics delivered by the athenaIntelligence team in 2012 were:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	94.2% of claims resolved on the first submission.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Taken as a whole, these activities result, in most cases, in a direct reduction in practices work.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Rather than submitting a claim with missing information, waiting for adjudication, receiving a denial, and then resubmitting the claim to start the cycle over again, our practices are alerted to issues prior to the first submission.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Similarly, practices are spared the tedious process of identifying upcoming appointments for patients that qualify for a specific Pay-for-Performance program and then remembering to track the appropriate measure during the encounter; instead, athenaClinicals introduces the measure seamlessly into the workflow.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	Our operations team assists clients at each critical step in the revenue cycle, clinical cycle, patient cycle, and referral cycle workflow processes and provides services that include insurance benefits packaging, insurance eligibility confirmation, claims submission, claims tracking, remittance posting, denials management, payment processing, formatting of lab requisitions, submission of lab requisitions, and monitoring and classification of all inbound faxes.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P62_S3	Additionally, we use third parties for data entry, data matching, data characterization, and outbound and inbound telephone services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P62_S4	We have contracted with International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our operations team.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P62_S5	These services are generally commercially available at comparable rates from other service providers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	We depend on satisfied clients to succeed.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	Our client contracts require minimum commitments by us on a range of tasks, including claims submission, payment posting, claims tracking, and claims denial management.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	We also commit to our clients that athenaNet is accessible 99.7% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Each quarter, our management conducts a survey of clients to identify client concerns and track progress against client satisfaction objectives.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	In our most recent survey 87.2% of the respondents reported that they would recommend athenahealth to a trusted friend or colleague.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	In addition to the services described above, we also provide client support services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	There are several client support service activities that take place on a regular basis, including the following:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	active, real-time performance monitoring for clients with complex and highly scaled operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	The increased burden on patients to pay for a larger percentage of their health care services, together with the need for care givers to have the ability to determine this patient payment responsibility at the time of service, has led some payers to develop the capability to accept and process claims in real time.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	This is frequently referred to within the industry as real time adjudication (or RTA ) because it avoids the processing time that adjudication of claims by payers has historically involved.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	Under an RTA system, payers notify physicians immediately upon receipt of billing information if third-party claims are accepted or rejected, the amount that will be paid by the payer, and the amount that the patient may owe under the particular health plan involved.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	Taking advantage of this payer capability, we have designed a platform for transacting with payer RTA systems that is payer-neutral and designed to integrate the various payer RTA processes so that our clients experience the same workflow regardless of payer.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P68_S4	Using this platform, we have collaborated with three major payers, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, Humana, and United Healthcare, to process RTA transactions with their systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Sales and Marketing We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of physician clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	We expect to expand our network by selling our services to new clients and cross-selling additional services into our client base.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S3	We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S4	Our sales force is divided into four groups: the national accounts team, which is dedicated to serving the very largest managed care organizations, including multi-state hospital systems and academic medical centers, as well as those with high growth potential, including for-profit health care systems; the enterprise team, which is dedicated to managed care organizations with 21 or more physicians that are not handled by the national accounts team; the group team, which is dedicated to medical practices with five to twenty physicians; and the small group team, which is dedicated to practices with one to four physicians.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S5	Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S6	Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients, we conduct a consultative sales process.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P69_S7	This process includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	We refer to these third parties as channels and the individuals and organizations involved as our channel partners.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for providing us sales lead information that results in sales.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S3	These channel partners generally do not make sales but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S4	Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as an independent sales representative, a purchasing agent (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or a joint marketer of combined service offerings that we jointly develop with that third party.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S5	In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S6	In 2012, channel-based leads were associated with approximately 41% of our new business.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S7	Our channel relationships include state medical societies, health care information technology product companies, health care product distribution companies, consulting firms, group purchasing organizations, health systems, regional extension centers, and payers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P70_S8	Examples of these types of channel relationships include:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Humana Inc. ( Humana ) .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	In August 2010, we entered into an alliance with Humana to promote a program to reward quality, efficiency, and improved coordination of care for Humana s Medicare beneficiaries.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	earn additional revenue above their current fee schedule for meeting certain performance criteria.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	Humana is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	d/b/a PSS World Medical Shared Services, Inc. ( PSS ) .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	In October 2010, we entered into an agreement with PSS for the marketing and sale of our revenue cycle, clinical cycle, and patient cycle services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, PSS has a non-exclusive right to distribute, sell, market, and promote our services in the United States (excluding Hawaii) and we will pay PSS commissions based upon the contract value of client orders placed through PSS.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	According to PSS, they are the largest provider of medical and surgical supplies to the physician market in the United States, with a sales force of more than 750 sales consultants who distribute medical supplies and equipment to approximately 100,000 offices in all 50 states.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Marketing Initiatives Since our service model is new to most physicians, our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so that they will view our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	Our marketing initiatives are generally targeted toward specific segments of the medical practice market.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P76_S3	These marketing programs primarily consist of:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	In June 2006, we introduced our annual PayerView rankings to provide an industry-unique framework that systematically addresses what we believe is administrative complexity that exists between payers and providers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	PayerView is designed to look at payers performance based on a number of categories, which combine to provide an overall ranking aimed at quantifying the ease of doing business with the payer.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	All data used for the rankings come from our clients actual claims performance data and depict our experience in dealing with individual payers across the nation.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P77_S3	The rankings include payers that meet a threshold of 6,500 claims per quarter in athenaNet.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Competition We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	Our primary competition is the use of locally installed software to manage revenue cycle, clinical cycle, patient cycle, and referral cycle workflow within the physician s office.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	Other nationwide competitors have begun introducing services that they refer to as on-demand or software-as-a-service models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P78_S3	Software and service companies that sell practice management and EHR software and medical billing, collection, and referral management services include Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; eClinicalWorks, LLC; Epic Systems Corporation; GE Healthcare; Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc.; Quality Systems, Inc.; Sage Software Healthcare, Inc.; SCI Solutions, Inc.; and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P78_S4	As a service company that provides revenue cycle services, we also compete against large billing companies such as Ingenix, a division of United Healthcare, Inc.; McKesson Corp.; and regional billing companies.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P78_S5	The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition than we do, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with health care providers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	These companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, and patent prosecution and litigation and to finance capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the services that we provide are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws and regulations, including regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as additional regulation.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	Government Regulation of Health Information HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules .
1131096_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it (collectively, HIPAA ) contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	These are embodied in the Privacy Rule and Security Rule portions of HIPAA.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	The Privacy Rule imposes a complex system of requirements on covered entities for complying with this basic standard.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules apply directly to covered entities, such as health care providers who engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from the HIPAA-prescribed electronic forms and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse, and as such are a covered entity.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P82_S3	In addition, our clients are also covered entities.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	In order to provide clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules require us to enter into business associate agreements with our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	that we will assist the client in question with certain of its duties under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	In addition to the Privacy and Security Rules, HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to health care billing be conducted using prescribed electronic formats.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	For example, claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to payers must comply with specific formatting standards, and these standards apply whether the payer is a government or a private entity.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	As a covered entity subject to HIPAA, we must meet these requirements, and moreover, we must structure and provide our services in a way that supports our clients HIPAA compliance obligations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	The HITECH Act, which became law in February 2009, and the regulations issued under it, have provided, among other things, clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P85_S4	As these additional requirements become effective, we will be required to comply with them.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the requirements imposed by the HITECH Act, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	2010 and establish minimum standards for protecting and storing personal information about Massachusetts residents contained in paper or electronic format.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Government Regulation of Reimbursement Our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	Accordingly, our clients are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government health care programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other health care providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P88_S3	It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement future reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement under government programs that adversely affect our client base or our cost of providing our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Fraud and Abuse A number of federal and state laws, loosely referred to as fraud and abuse laws, are used to prosecute health care providers, physicians, and others that make, offer, seek, or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state health care program and, in some instances, any private program.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	Given the breadth of these laws and regulations, they are potentially applicable to our business; the transactions that we undertake on behalf of our clients; and the financial arrangements through which we market, sell, and distribute our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	These laws and regulations include: Anti-Kickback Laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to health care providers and patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	The federal health care programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	Courts have construed this anti-kickback law to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of one of the arrangements is to encourage patient referrals or other federal health care program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	There are several limited exclusions known as safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	These safe harbors have very limited application.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Penalties for federal anti-kickback violations are severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties with triple damages, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Many states have similar anti-kickback laws, some of which are not limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government health care program.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with the submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse in connection with such submission and payment, for example, by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing for the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	These laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	For example, one federal false claim law forbids knowing submission to government programs of false claims for reimbursement for medical items or services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P95_S4	Under this law, knowledge may consist of willful ignorance or reckless disregard of falsity.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P95_S5	How these concepts apply to services such as ours that rely substantially on automated processes has not been well defined in the regulations or relevant case law.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P95_S6	As a result, our errors with respect to the formatting, preparation, or transmission of such claims and any mishandling by us of claims information that is supplied by our clients or other third parties may be determined to, or may be alleged to, involve willful ignorance or reckless disregard of any falsity that is later determined to exist.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we charge our clients a percentage of the collections that they receive as a result of our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	To the extent that liability under fraud and abuse laws and regulations requires intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	In addition to the provisions relating to health care access and delivery, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made changes to health care fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	The PPACA expands false claim laws, amends key provisions of other anti-fraud and abuse statutes, provides the government with new enforcement tools and funding for enforcement, and enhances both criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P97_S2	The PPACA may result in increased anti-fraud enforcement activities.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	Stark Law and Similar State Laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and health care entities.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	designated health services reimbursed under federally funded programs to entities with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, unless such referrals fall within a specific exception.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	Violations of the statute can result in civil monetary penalties and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P100_S2	Furthermore, reimbursement claims for care rendered under forbidden referrals may be deemed false or fraudulent, resulting in liability under other fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	Laws in many states similarly forbid billing based on referrals between individuals and/or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	These laws vary widely from state to state.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S2	In many states, there are laws that prohibit non-licensed practitioners from practicing medicine, prevent corporations from being licensed as practitioners, and prohibit licensed medical practitioners from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S3	In some states, these prohibitions take the form of laws or regulations forbidding the splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S4	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S5	There are also federal and state laws that forbid or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S6	Some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P101_S7	In particular, the Medicare program specifically requires that billing agents who receive Medicare payments on behalf of medical care providers must meet the following requirements:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	in receiving the payment, the agent must act only on behalf of the provider, except insofar as the agent uses part of that payment to compensate the agent for the agent s billing and collection services.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	Medicaid regulations similarly provide that payments may be received by billing agents in the name of their clients without violating anti-assignment requirements if payment to the agent is related to the cost of the billing service, not related on a percentage basis to the amount billed or collected, and not dependent on collection of payment.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	Electronic Prescribing Laws States have differing prescription format and signature requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	Many existing laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the methods of e-commerce now being developed.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	However, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	In addition, on November 7, 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services published its final E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program regulations, referred to below as the E-Prescribing Regulations.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	These regulations are required by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ) and became effective beginning on January 1, 2006.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S4	The E-Prescribing Regulations consist of detailed standards and requirements, in addition to the HIPAA standards discussed previously, for prescription and other information transmitted electronically in connection with a drug benefit covered by the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S5	These standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S6	The standards apply to prescription drug plans participating in the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P104_S7	Aspects of our services are affected by such regulation, as our clients need to comply with these requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	Anti-Tampering Laws For certain prescriptions that cannot or may not be transmitted electronically from physician to pharmacy, both federal and state laws require that the written forms used exhibit anti-tampering features.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	For example, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 has since April 2008 required that most prescriptions covered by Medicaid must demonstrate security features that prevent copying, erasing, or counterfeiting of the written form.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	Because our clients will, on occasion, need to use printed forms, we must take these laws into consideration for purposes of the prescription functions of our athenaClinicals service.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	implementation specifications, and certification criteria as well as the establishment of certification programs for EHR technology.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	In January 2011, HHS issued a final rule to establish a permanent certification program for EHR technology, including how organizations can become ONC-Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies (ONC-ATCBs).
1131096_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	ONC-ATCBs are required to test and certify that EHR technology is compliant with the standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary and meet the definition of certified EHR technology.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P106_S3	In July 2010, the Secretary published the final rule that adopted standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for EHR technology.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P106_S4	Our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR by CCHIT, an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable eligible provider certification criteria adopted by the Secretary.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	While we believe our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	United States Food and Drug Administration The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices and a proposed rule for reclassification of medical device data systems under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P108_S1	The FDA has stated that health information technology software is a medical device under the FDCA, and we expect that the FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in health care settings regardless of whether the draft policy or proposed rule is finalized or changed.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P108_S2	We anticipate additional guidance on this subject by early 2014, in the form of a report to be issued by the FDA, ONCHIT, and the Federal Communications Commission.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P108_S3	This report would propose a regulatory framework for health information technology that promotes innovation, protects patient safety, and avoids regulatory duplication.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	If our computer software functionality is considered a medical device under the FDCA, we could be subject to additional regulatory requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	Under the FDCA, medical devices include any instrument, apparatus, machine, contrivance, or other similar or related article that is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P110_S1	FDA regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and import and export.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P110_S2	FDA requirements with respect to devices that are determined to pose lesser risk to the public include:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P111_S1	Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, a recommendation by the FDA to disallow us from entering into government contracts, and criminal prosecutions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P111_S2	The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P111_S3	Foreign Regulations Our subsidiary in Chennai, India, is subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P111_S4	These regulations include Indian federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws, and qualification for tax status and tax incentives.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P112_S1	Despite these reliances, we believe the following factors are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage:
1131096_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	a continued focus on the improved financial results of our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we held three U.S. patents, with eighteen U.S. patent applications pending, one U.S. provisional patent application pending, and eight foreign patent applications pending.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S1	Our first patent relates to our unique patient workflow process, including the Rules Engine, which applies proprietary rules to practice and payer inputs on a live, ongoing basis to produce cleaner health care claims, which can be adjudicated more quickly and efficiently.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S2	This patent was granted in November 2009 and expires in December 2023.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S3	Our second patent covers the self-service implementation of a practice management system, which allows for our clients to configure their systems themselves by responding to a series of rule-based questions, thus saving time and money.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S4	This second patent was granted in May 2010 and expires in July 2029.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S5	Our last patent relates to our automated reconciliation of bank transactions with deposit entries in athenaCollector, which helps to speed preparation of month-end financial statements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S6	This patent was granted in December 2012 and expires in May 2030.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S7	We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S8	We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered service marks to protect our brand.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S9	Our registered service marks include athenaClinicals, athenaCollector, athenaCommunicator, athenaCoordinator, athenahealth, athenaNet, PayerView, and the athenahealth logo.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P114_S10	Anodyne Analytics, Anodyne Dashboard, athenaCare, athenaEnterprise, athenaInsight, athenaOne, athenaRules, ReminderCall, and VaccineView are unregistered service marks.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P115_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes the registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks of other persons.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P116_S0	We have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P116_S1	Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P116_S2	In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P116_S3	Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P117_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of medical practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P117_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P117_S2	In addition, as further explained in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P118_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we had 2,339 full-time employees, with 1,362 in service operations, 353 in sales and marketing, 402 in research and development, and 222 in general and administrative functions.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P118_S1	Of these full-time employees, 2,148 were located in the U.S. and 191 were located in Chennai, India.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P119_S0	We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P119_S1	None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P120_S0	The financial information required under this Item 1 is incorporated herein by reference to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Where You Can Find More Information Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available through the Investors portion of our website ( www.athenahealth.com ) free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P120_S1	Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other securities filings unless specifically incorporated herein by reference.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P120_S2	In addition, our filings with the SEC may be accessed through the SEC s Interactive Data Electronic Applications (IDEA) system at www.sec.gov.
1131096_13_ITEM1_P121_S0	All statements made in any of our securities filings, including all forward-looking statements or information, are made as of the date of the document in which the statement is included, and we do not assume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS GENERAL We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The provision by third parties of revenue cycle services to medical practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty, a limited set of payers, or a limited geographical area.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We anticipate that the software, statistical, and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Revenue cycle and clinical cycle software for medical practices has historically been dominated by large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these entities are now offering on-demand services or a software-as-a-service model under which software is centrally administered, and these vendors may also provide administrative services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The size, financial strength, and breadth of offerings of the larger entities is increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and health care industries.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect large integrated technology companies to continue to become more active in our markets, both through acquisition and internal investment.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, a few smaller companies have started providing single-instance, Internet-based software using a model similar to ours; the offerings of these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage of our services and impact our market share.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Further, while the market for patient communication and referral management services is growing and is not as yet dominated by a small group of vendors with significant resources, our patient and referral cycle services face competition from a wide variety of market participants.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S7	For example, certain health systems have developed their own patient portals or referral management systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S8	If we fail to distinguish our patient and referral cycle offerings from the other options available to health care providers, the demand for and market share of those offerings may decrease.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Some of our current large competitors, such as Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Epic Systems Corporation; GE Healthcare; McKesson Corp.; Quality Systems, Inc.; Sage Software Healthcare, Inc.; and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S10	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S11	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S12	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S13	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S14	Further, in light of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P3_S15	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition to new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target market.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but that offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The market for Internet-based medical business services may not develop substantially further or develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	While Internet-based medical business services are becoming more accepted, the market for these services remains narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand business services in general, and for their revenue, clinical, and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to an on-demand application service.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Changes in the health care industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	As the health care industry evolves, changes in our client and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S8	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of health care providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Such larger health care organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S11	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S12	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S13	Our success depends on providing services that the medical community uses to improve business performance and quality of service to patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S14	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S15	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients will want.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S16	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely basis, we may lose clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S17	Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S18	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S19	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P5_S20	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have been experiencing a period of rapid growth.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	To manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources and management attention from other projects, such as the development of new services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent, and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, noncompetition, and assignment of inventions agreements.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our attempts to protect our intellectual property may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	While we have three issued U.S. patents and a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending as of December 31, 2012 , we may be unable to obtain further meaningful patent protection for our technology.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Further, our platform incorporates open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	While we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses, and therefore the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could materially harm our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	For example, in 2011 a complaint was filed by PPS Data, LLC naming us in a patent infringement case.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	For additional information regarding this litigation, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S9	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S11	In addition, we may be required to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling for such a claim.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P11_S13	We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	For example, we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the property on which our corporate headquarters are located.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	This property is a former Superfund site, and our ownership of it, or any of our other properties, could expose us to liability under applicable environmental laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS We depend upon two third-party service providers for important processing functions.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If either of these third-party providers does not fulfill its contractual obligations or chooses to discontinue its services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have entered into service agreements with International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our client service operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Among other things, these providers process critical claims data and clinical documents.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If these services fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation, and operating results could be harmed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Failure of either service provider to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P13_S6	With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves, which increases our risk.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources, and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We conduct operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, and pandemics.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, client satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain clients, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S7	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S9	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S10	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Volatility in the price of our stock or failure to obtain stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under our equity plans may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Furthermore, the requirements to expense equity awards may discourage us from granting the size or type of equity awards that job candidates require to join our company.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF EPOCRATES, INC.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Completion of the proposed acquisition of Epocrates, Inc. ( Epocrates ) is subject to various closing conditions, involves significant costs, and will require considerable attention from our management.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Failure to complete the acquisition could adversely affect our stock price and our future business and operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	On January 7, 2013, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Epocrates, Inc. ( Epocrates ), a leading provider of clinical content to healthcare providers via a mobile device at the point of care.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The completion of the proposed acquisition of Epocrates is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions, including the approval by Epocrates stockholders, and we cannot assure you that such conditions will be satisfied and that the acquisition will be successfully completed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In the event that the acquisition is not consummated, we will have spent considerable time and resources, and incurred substantial costs, including costs related to the acquisition, many of which must be paid even if the merger is not completed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If the acquisition is not consummated, our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged and, as a result, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Epocrates.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The success of the acquisition of Epocrates will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the businesses of athenahealth and Epocrates in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing relationships and that allows us to achieve operational synergies and capitalize on the increased brand recognition and customer base of the combined company.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In particular, the acquisition may not be accretive or accelerate sales in near or long term.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S8	athenahealth and Epocrates have operated and will continue to operate independently until the expected close of the acquisition in the early part of 2013.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S9	It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees; the disruption of athenahealth s or Epocrates ongoing businesses; or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with third parties and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management s attention from our core business and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to our shareholders.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S11	An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock after the completion of the acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S12	Further, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S13	Operational improvements and actual cost synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than we expect and may take longer to achieve than we anticipate.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S14	If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, athenahealth and Epocrates may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S15	We expect to incur additional costs in connection with the acquisition of Epocrates and in integrating the companies into a single business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S16	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , athenahealth incurred legal and professional fees in connection with the Epocrates acquisition of approximately $0.5 million.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S17	We expect to incur additional costs integrating the companies operations, product offerings, and personnel, which cannot be estimated accurately at this time.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P20_S18	If the total costs of the integration exceed the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, our financial results could be adversely affected.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower-than-expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer-than-expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned revenue expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S6	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S7	If the revenue of our clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Under most of our client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our physician clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government health care programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Also, although we currently estimate our expected customer life to be twelve years, this is only an estimate, and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated on 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete with software vendors subject to sales and use taxes, and otherwise harm our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe that our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, we voluntarily approach state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the states in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of, taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The sales cycle for our services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution, although this period can be substantially longer.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation, although some of our new-client set-up projects especially those for larger clients are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated expected customer life, currently twelve years, or the contract term.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Even if implementation has begun, there can be no assurance that we will recognize revenue on a timely basis or at all from our efforts.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Implementation for a given client may be canceled, as our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or no reason on 90 days notice.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Despite the fact that we typically require a deposit in advance of implementation, some clients have canceled before our services have been started.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, implementation may be delayed, or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future, for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	If implementation periods are extended, our provision of the revenue cycle, clinical cycle, or patient cycle services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the canceled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S6	These factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S7	As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P30_S8	RISKS RELATED TO OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary athenaNet application from operating properly.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If athenaNet does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Moreover, information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Errors may result from receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information or from interface of our services with legacy systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Because changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S9	These defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to clients or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S11	Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S12	The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P31_S13	In addition, clients relying on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We market and sell services that, among other things, provide information to assist care providers in tracking and treating ill patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby harm our business and operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our clients or their patients may assert claims against us alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our software or service processes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	A product liability claim or errors or omissions claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such a claim.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If our security measures are breached or fail, and unauthorized access is obtained to a client s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our services involve the web-based storage and transmission of clients proprietary information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce customer confidence and require substantial resources to address.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client or patient data.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We rely upon our clients as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	On occasion, our clients have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Failure of clients to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S6	In addition, our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their client data or the data of their patients on our systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S9	We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S10	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S11	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S12	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S13	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P34_S14	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Various events could interrupt clients access to athenaNet, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The ability to access athenaNet is critical to our clients administration of care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our systems or those of others; and (iv) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our systems or those of others.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If clients access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely in part upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our services, which would adversely impact our revenues.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S7	In addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S9	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P35_S10	Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data-hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we currently serve our clients from three third-party data-hosting facilities located in the greater Boston, Massachusetts, and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, areas.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These facilities are operated by Colospace Inc. and two subsidiaries of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, in December 2009 we signed a contract with a major provider of disaster recovery services, SunGard Availability Services, LP, to store our disaster recovery plans and provide disaster recovery testing services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In the case of a significant event at any of our data centers, we could move operations from that data center to our other data centers within a reasonable timeframe.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, these facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our ability to deliver our Internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone, facsimile, and pager systems.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	However, we have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including database software from Oracle Corporation and storage devices from International Business Machines Corporation and EMC Corporation.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms; however, it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	While we have implemented certain features and safeguards designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our software, content, and services are used to assist clinical decision-making and provide information about patient medical histories and treatment plans.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our proprietary athenaClinicals service is utilized in clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	If our athenaClinicals service fails to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of that service is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, clinicians, or patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages and to require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S5	We maintain general liability and insurance coverage, but this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S6	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S7	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Our proprietary software may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S9	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S10	From time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software, and such defects or errors can be expected to appear in the future.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S11	Defects and errors that are not timely detected and remedied could expose us to risk of liability to clients, clinicians, and patients and cause delays in introduction of new services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, or decrease market acceptance or client satisfaction with our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S12	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P44_S13	We may be liable for use of incorrect or incomplete data that we provide, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We store and display data for use by health care providers in treating patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our clients or third parties provide us with most of these data.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of health care services or erroneous health information.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	While we maintain insurance coverage, we cannot assure that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P45_S6	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION Government regulation of health care creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the health care industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Many health care laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In particular, many existing health care laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the health care information services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Some of the risks we face from health care regulation are described below: False or Fraudulent Claim Laws .
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse in connection with such submission and payment.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S5	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S6	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S7	The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to engage in or overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S8	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S9	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to our clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations .
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity subject to HIPAA.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	In addition, our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	access by the Department of Health and Human Services to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it have provided clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In addition, ONCHIT is coordinating the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the health care sector.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S5	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S6	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, and their interpretations are no less stringent than ours, we seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our clients, and since we do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Among our services, we provide telephone reminder services to patients, Internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We believe that reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure of individually identifiable health information have been and are being taken in connection with these services, including the use of multiple-password security.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	However, any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and other personally identifiable information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In addition to false claims and HIPAA requirements, we are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to health care providers and patients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	For example, the federal health care programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal health care program.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws forbid bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients, vendors, or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	For example, one aspect of our athenaCoordinator service is the preparation and submission of electronic orders from providers to other participants in the health care system ( e.g. , hospitals, labs, and specialists).
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As the recipients of those orders will in certain instances pay us for the submission of accurate, complete, and readable orders instead of the handwritten and often incomplete orders traditionally submitted, our service could potentially be seen as providing referrals to the order recipients in exchange for payment.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	services might lead to a challenge of the legality of those services by government regulators.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	There are federal and state laws that forbid payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with health care providers.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	These vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal laws called the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P59_S4	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws .
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P61_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our service fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	States have differing prescription format requirements, and, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Any determination that we or our clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P63_S4	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As a company that provides EHR functionality, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The software component of our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2011/2012 compliant Complete EHR by CCHIT, an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The 2011/2012 criteria support the Stage 1 meaningful use measures required to qualify eligible providers and hospitals for funding under the HITECH Act.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	While we believe that our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of our client s claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Although we do not determine what is billed to a payer, to the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for health care services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P69_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and timeframes may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by clients.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In addition, in February 2011 the FDA issued a final rule regarding regulation of Medical Device Data Systems (MDDSs), which are systems that are intended to transfer, store, convert, or display medical device data.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P70_S2	While EHRs are expressly exempted from the final rule, it is possible that future changes in our services could involve the transfer, storage, conversion, or display of medical device data.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In addition, a report, due by early 2014 from the FDA, ONCHIT, and the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to propose a regulatory framework for health information technology for the purpose of promoting innovation, protecting patient safety, and avoiding regulatory duplication.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P70_S4	To the extent that our software is considered a medical device under the policy or an MDDS under the final rule, or is the subject of additional regulation promulgated as a result of the report, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Potential health care reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new services types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Our services may be significantly impacted by health care reform initiatives and will be subject to increasing regulatory requirements, either of which could affect our business in a multitude of ways.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If substantive health care reform or applicable regulatory requirements are adopted, we may have to change or adapt our services and software to comply.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S5	Reform or changing regulatory requirements may also render our services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S6	This may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop services or software.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S7	For example, the conversion to the ICD-10 standard for coding medical diagnoses will likely cause significant disruption to our industry and consume a large amount of resources on our part.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S8	Such reforms may also make introduction of new service types more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S9	Such changes may even prevent introduction by us of new services or make the continuation of our existing services unprofitable or impossible.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P72_S10	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and customer service providers, International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Due to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to government regulation unrelated to health care.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	While our services are primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to health care, certain aspects of those services may require us to comply with regulatory schemes from other areas.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Examples of such regulatory schema include: Antitrust Laws .
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our national cloud-based network allows us access to cost and pricing data for a large number of providers in most regional markets, as well as to the contracted rates for third-party payers.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	To the extent that our services enable providers to compare their cost and pricing data with those of their competitors, those providers could collude to increase the pricing for their services, to reduce the compensation they pay their employees, or to collectively negotiate agreements with third parties.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Similarly, if payers are able to compare their contracted rates of payment to providers, those payers may seek to reduce the amounts they might otherwise pay.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Such actions may be deemed to be anti-competitive and a violation of federal antitrust laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P76_S4	To the extent that we are deemed to have enabled such activities, we could be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission and be required to curtail or terminate the services that permitted such collusion.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	As a billing service that offers patient communication and registration services, our employees or those of our service providers may from time to time come into contact with patients who owe our clients outstanding amounts.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Communications with patients that relate to amounts owed may be deemed to subject us or our service providers to federal or state debt collection laws and regulations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Such laws and regulations, if deemed to apply to us, could require registration with government agencies and compliance with significant administrative obligations ( e.g. , to maintain an in-state office with local employees), which could result in increased expenses and subject us to fines and penalties for violation.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Following the disclosure in 2012 of the methods used by debt collector Accretive Health to obtain payment of amounts owed by patients to one of its hospital clients, heightened focus on debt collection practices may lead to additional regulation and greater scrutiny of existing debt collection practices.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P78_S2	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P78_S4	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Other relationships permit third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S3	In each of these cases, we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S4	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided, as well as the channel relationships themselves, may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S5	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S6	Any misconduct by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients, any failure to follow contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S7	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P80_S8	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and lead analysts or investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, resulting in reduction in the market price of our stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S3	If any of our employees or subcontractors takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S4	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S5	Subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand if we do not participate in such programs.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S6	In the past few years, entities such as the Massachusetts Healthcare Consortium have offered to subsidize adoption by physicians of EHR technology.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S7	In addition, federal regulations have been changed to permit such subsidy from additional sources, subject to certain limitations, and the current administration passed the HITECH Act, which provides federal support for EHR initiatives.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S8	While we have qualified for and participated in many of such subsidy programs, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S9	To the extent that we do not participate in such programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S10	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S11	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P81_S12	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S3	If a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S4	If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S5	As of December 31, 2012 , we had approximately 36.3 million shares of common stock outstanding.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S6	Moreover, certain holders of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S7	We have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our 1997 Stock Plan, 2000 Stock Plan, 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P82_S8	As of December 31, 2012 , we had outstanding options to purchase approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock (approximately 1.4 million of which were exercisable at December 31, 2012 ) that, if exercised, would result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	December 31, 2012 , we had outstanding restricted stock units totaling approximately 1.1 million that, if vested, would result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Actual or potential sales of our stock by our employees, including members of our senior management team, pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons, and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	In accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and our policies regarding stock transactions, a number of our directors and employees, including members of our senior management team, have adopted and will continue to adopt pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell shares of our common stock that they hold or will hold as the result of exercise or vesting of equity grants.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Generally, stock sales under such plans by members of our senior management team and directors require public filings.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Actual or potential sales of our stock by such persons could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P84_S3	For example, actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P84_S5	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P84_S6	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	the ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our by-laws.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally an entity that, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S2	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S3	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, stockholders ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S4	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S5	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S6	Therefore, investors are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_13_ITEM1A_P86_S7	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.
1131096_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we own a complex of buildings, including approximately 133,000 square feet of office space, on approximately 53 acres of land in Belfast, Maine, as well as a conference and training facility on approximately 396 acres of land in Northport, Maine.

1131096_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	On July 28, 2011, a complaint was filed by PPS Data, LLC naming us in a patent infringement case ( PPS Data, LLC v. athenahealth, Inc. , Civil Action No. 3:11-cv-00746, United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida).
1131096_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint alleges that we have infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,343,271 with a listed issue date of January 29, 2002, entitled Electronic Creation, Submission, Adjudication, and Payment of Health Insurance Claims (the 271 Patent ).
1131096_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	The complaint seeks an injunction enjoining infringement, damages, pre- and post-judgment costs and interest, and attorneys fees.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	On September 8, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	No. 6,341,265 with a listed issue date of January 22, 2002, entitled Provider claim editing and settlement system, and U.S. Patent No. 7,194,416 with a listed issue date of March 20, 2007, entitled Interactive creation and adjudication of health care insurance claims.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	The Court granted the plaintiff s motion for leave to amend its complaint on December 21, 2011, and on December 23, 2011, the plaintiff filed its amended complaint.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	On December 27, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the 271 Patent.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S3	On December 29, 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted our request for reexamination of the 271 Patent.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S4	On January 9, 2012, we filed a motion to stay the case pending completion of the patent reexamination, and on March 1, 2012, the Court granted our motion to stay the case.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S5	We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the amended complaint and will continue to contest the claims vigorously.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S6	In addition, from time to time we may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1131096_13_ITEM3_P3_S7	We do not, however, currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

1131096_13_ITEM5_P1_S4	We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1131096_13_ITEM5_P1_S5	Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.

1131096_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes to these financial statements, and the other financial information that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Overview athenahealth provides business services that help medical caregivers achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more money and exercising more control over their administrative tasks.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	These services are designed to reduce the administrative burden of complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many of the related tasks that distract medical care givers and staff from delivering care.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud-based platform, athenaNet.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	We differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements through athenaNet to clients without any action on the part of the client.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	athenaNet enables us to quickly implement our solution at a low up-front cost and to seamlessly work in tandem with our clients in real time.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The services provided through our single-instance cloud are currently packaged as four integrated components: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management, athenaClinicals for electronic health record management, athenaCommunicator for patient communication management, and athenaCoordinator for referral cycle management.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	The use of our single-instance platform allows all clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of all of our other clients through our patented billing Rules Engine and our clinical Quality Management Engine.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our clients use these rules engines to monitor and benchmark their performance with peer practices across the network.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Complementing athenaCollector is our business intelligence offering, Anodyne Solutions, which provides physicians and practice managers with comprehensive, detailed insight into practice performance, and Healthcare Data Services, which offers practices a better understanding of the cost and quality of the care they provide to their patients.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	Each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct components: Software, Knowledge, and Work.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	The cloud-based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients, payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P2_S6	Knowledge is infused into each of our services via our Rules Engine as we work with clients, payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	The third component to each of our services is the Work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Wherever possible, we replace manual processes with automation, but where automation is not possible, we provide that manual labor rather than returning it to clients to be completed.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	This unique service model of Software, Knowledge, and Work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance, creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	We charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases, so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , we generated revenue of $422.3 million from the sale of our services compared to $324.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , and $245.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S6	Our revenue is predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S7	This revenue is generally determined as a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients, so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians and other medical providers working within our client accounts, the collections of these physicians, and the number of services purchased.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S8	To provide these services, we incur expenses in several categories, including direct operating, selling and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P3_S9	In general, our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our intended growth rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	future, our overall business management activities, and our infrastructure.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity, in adherence to related financial covenants.

1131096_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Each outstanding option and restricted stock unit award shall be exercisable or shall be settled upon the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Epocrates equity compensation plan, except that each option shall be exercisable for, and each restricted stock unit shall be converted into the right to receive, shares of the Company s common stock using an exchange ratio based on the average closing sales prices per share of the Company s common stock for the ten trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the closing of the acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	The acquisition is expected to enable the Company to accelerate awareness of athenahealth s services across the physician market and deliver high-value information to the clinical community.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	The transaction is expected to close in the early part of 2013 and is subject to various closing conditions, including the requisite Epocrates stockholder approval and the expiration or termination of any waiting period under Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , the Company incurred legal and professional fees in connection with the acquisition of $0.5 million , which are included in general and administrative expenses.

1131096_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The purchase price will be approximately $169 million , subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase and sale agreement, and the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013, subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence by athenahealth.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We have incurred legal and professional fees in connection with the acquisition of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 , which are included in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	Commitment Letter On January 7, 2013, we entered into a commitment letter, pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A. committed to increase its commitment to provide revolving loans under our credit facility by an amount up to $55 million as a source of funding for the Epocrates transaction.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
1131096_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including our estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock options; (5) allocation of direct and indirect expenses; (6) fair value of contingent consideration and acquired intangible assets in a business combination; and (7) litigation reserves.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	obtained, and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Actual results could differ from the estimates we have used.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, as they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	We derive our revenue from business services associated with revenue cycle management, electronic health record management, patient communication management, referral cycle management and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that renew automatically upon completion.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenaNet, minimum fees, flat fees, or per-claim fees where applicable.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the subsequent month and delivered to clients primarily by email.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	For most of our clients, fees are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	Amounts that have been accrued are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: - there is evidence of an arrangement; - the service has been provided to the client; - the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and - the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	All revenue, other than implementation revenue, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers; we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	If and when we are not able to deliver all separate units of account in the same period, we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We recognize our non-refundable up-front fees over the contract term or estimated expected customer life, whichever is longer.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	As the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services, we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete, at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the longer of the estimated expected customer life or contract life.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	We determined the estimated customer life considering the following key factors:
1131096_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The estimated customer life, or expected performance period, for the years presented is 12 years.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our estimate of expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	For example, if in the future, we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	On the other hand, if in the future, we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The amount of deferred revenue related to non-refundable up-front fees is $53.7 million as of December 31, 2012.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Business Combinations, including purchased intangibles and contingent consideration, are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	All changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and a probability-weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results and earn-out targets related to estimating the value of the contingent considerations.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We review acquired intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill and intangibles, acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangibles which are finite-lived assets or changes in fair value of the contingent consideration from the date of acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in the estimates of earn out results.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We have $48.1 million and $21.6 million carrying amount of goodwill and purchased intangibles, as of December 31, 2012, respectively.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	We have a liability of $0.4 million of contingent consideration related to $5.0 million in potential payments as of December 31, 2012, related to the Proxsys business combinations cross sell earn out.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	For the initial purchase price allocation, we estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration related to the Proxsys acquisition in August of 2011 to be $4.4 million.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	To date, we have paid out an insignificant amount and decreased the fair value by $3.9 million.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	We derive our revenue from two sources: from business services associated with our revenue cycle management, electronic health record management, patient communication management, referral cycle management and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Implementation and other revenue consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	Business services accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	Business services revenue are typically 2% to 8% of a practice s total collections depending upon the services purchased, the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice, plus a per-statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	Accordingly, business services revenue is largely driven by: the number of physician practices and other service providers we serve, the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians, the mix of our services used by those physician practices and other medical providers, and our contracted rates.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	Additionally, the volume of activity and related collections vary from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the flu season.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	While we believe that the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season will continue to impact collections by our physician clients, there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P35_S4	Implementation and other revenue are largely driven by the increase in the volume of our new business.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	None of our clients accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits, claim processing costs, other direct expenses, and stock-based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients, including staff who implement new clients.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	We include in direct operating expense all service costs associated with athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, athenaCommunicator, athenaCoordinator, Anodyne Solutions and Healthcare Data Services.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	We expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation, with higher volumes of work in particular functions, geographies, and medical specialti es.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	Although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future, the direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenue as we increase automation.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), depreciation, an d amortization, except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and on-line initiatives) and personnel-related expense for sales and marketing employees (including salaries, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expenses).
1131096_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	We have increased our sales and marketing expenses from year to year and we expect to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel and support personnel to add new clien ts and increase sales to our existing clients and expand awareness through paid search and other similar initiatives.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	We also plan to expand our marketing activities, such as attending trade shows, expanding user groups, and creating new printed materials.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	As a result, we expect that, in the near-term, sales and marketing expense will increase in line with revenue growth.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses for research and development employees (including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expenses) and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	We expect that, in the near-term, research and development expenditures will increase in absolute terms and will likely remain consistent as a percent of revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services; however the amount of expenditures that should be capitalized as software development costs versus expensed as research and development could vary based on the specific projects we undertake.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees (including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expense), occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), and insurance premiums; and, outside professional fees for accountant s, lawyers, external costs associated with acquisitions, change in the fair value of contingent consideration and consultants.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development and acquisition costs, which we amortize over a two to three-year period from the time of release of related software code.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	As we grow, we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	In the near term we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase as a percentage of total revenue.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Interest income represents earnings from our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	We currently do not have any debt outstanding and therefore have insignificant expense related to debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	We expect that in the near term our interest expense will substantially increase as we anticipate that we will need to borrow to fund a portion of the two proposed acquisitions discussed in the Recent Developments section.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Income tax provision consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and India.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory rate is mainly related to any changes in the fair value of contingent considerations related to non-tax deductible goodwill, the treatment of Incentive Stock Options ( ISOs ) and the impact of certain tax deduction limits related to certain of our highly compensated officers.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to non-tax deductible goodwill and the treatment of disqualifying dispositions related to ISOs are also treated as discrete items which means they are recorded in the quarter in which they occur and could cause significant differences between the quarterly and annual effective tax rate.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	Also, we substantially ceased issuing ISOs in 2009, but we expect continued volatility related to these options since we cannot anticipate when disqualifying dispositions related to these options will occur.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed in 2013 and retroactively extends this type of credit through the end of 2013.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by 30% due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in business services revenue is primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	The summary of changes in the physicians and providers using our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, electronic health record management service, athenaClinicals, and patient communication management service, athenaCommunicator are as follows:
1131096_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The amount of collections processed are as follows:
1131096_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	The increase in revenue from implementation and other revenue was driven by new client implementations and increased professional services for our larger client base.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in implementation and other revenue is the result of the increase in the volume of our new business.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The increase in direct operating expense is primarily due to an increase in the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients and the related expense of providing services, including transactions expense and employee-related costs.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the direct operating employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, which increased $28.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 , to the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to the 28% increase in headcount since December 31, 2011 , and an increase fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	We increased headcount to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base has expanded and includes larger medical groups.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Amortization related to purchased intangible assets increased $1.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 , to the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, internal sales commissions and external partner channel commission of $15.7 million, or 31%, from $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our sales and marketing headcount increased by 28% since December 31, 2011 , as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase was also due to a $3.4 million increase in travel-related expenses and consulting and $5.4 million increase in online marketing, offline marketing and other marketing events for the year.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	Research and development expense increased due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense of $8.5 million, or 42%, from $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , to $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	This increase is due in part to a 45% increase in headcount from December 31, 2011 , as we hired additional research and development personnel in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	The increase was also due to a $1.9 million increase in travel-related expenses, infrastructure and consulting.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	General and administrative expense increase was partially due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $6.2 million, due to an increase in headcount and in fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	December 31, 2011 , as we added personnel to support our growth.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The increase in headcount drove an increase in our expenditures related to infrastructure by $3.4 million.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 , included an increase of $2.3 million in legal, audit, tax, consulting, external costs associated with acquisitions and insurance expenses along with an increase of $2.6 million in travel expenses, recruiting and corporate events.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	These increases are offset by a decrease in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $1.0 million due to less accounts requiring higher reserve percentages due to increased collection activity and a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration of $5.1 million.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P54_S4	The fair value considerations related to each of the contingent considerations are fully disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P54_S5	The impact of those described changes in the fair value of the contingent considerations on General and Administrative Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:
1131096_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 , was $25.6 million, an increase of $8.9 million, or 53%, from depreciation and amortization of $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation from fixed asset expenditures in 2012 and 2011 and higher amortization related to an increase in our software development costs.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The effective tax rate is higher due to larger permanent items for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily related to compensation in excess of tax deduction limits which had a 1.5% unfavorable impact, the change in the Anodyne contingent consideration which is treated as additional non-taxable goodwill which had a 1.5% unfavorable impact and the transaction costs related to the pending acquisition of Epocrates which had a 0.5% unfavorable impact.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The rate was also impacted by ISO disqualifying events which impacted the rate favorably by 2% for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	Comparatively, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 , was not impacted by compensation in excess of tax deduction limits, changes related to the Anodyne contingent consideration or non-deductible transaction costs but did have a favorable impact of 2.5% due to ISO disqualifications.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	On January 3, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law reinstating the federal research and development credit for the 2012 and 2013 years.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Under the accounting guidance on this topic, the effects are recognized as a component of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the financial statements for the interim or annual period that includes the enactment date.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The benefit related to the 2012 federal research and development credit of $0.7 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 , increased almost entirely due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The increase in business services revenue is primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The summary of changes in the physicians and providers using our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, electronic health record management service, athenaClinicals, and patient communication management service, athenaCommunicator are as follows:

1131096_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	The increase in revenue from implementation and other revenue was driven by new client implementations and increased professional services for our larger client base.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase in implementation and other revenue is the result of the increase in the volume of our new business.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	The increase in direct operating expense is primarily due to an increase in the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients and the related expense of providing services, including transactions expense and employee-related costs.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the direct operating employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, primarily due to the 21% increase in headcount since December 31, 2010, which does not include the approximately 200 employees from our acquisition of Proxsys at the end of August 2011.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Not including Proxsys, we increased headcount to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base has expanded and includes larger medical groups.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	compensation awards and an increase in amount paid to external channel partners.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Our sales and marketing headcount increased by 39% since December 31, 2010, as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	The increase was also due to a $8.6 million increase in sales and marketing programs to drive leads, meetings and awareness and $3.2 million increase in travel-related expenses, consulting, and other marketing expenses.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	Research and development expense increased due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $4.1 million for the year as a result of the increased headcount and increase in the fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation awards.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S4	Our research and development headcount increased 31% since December 31, 2010, as we hired additional research and development personnel in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies, as well as an overall increase in salaries for technical resources.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S5	General and administrative expense was primarily impacted by higher employee-related costs, an increase in infrastructure expenditures and changes in the fair value of the certain contingent consideration.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S6	An increase in higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $3.4 million is due to an increased headcount and increase in the fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation awards for the year.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S7	Our general and administrative headcount increased by 23% since December 31, 2010, as we added personnel to support our growth.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S8	General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 , included an increase of $1.2 million in legal, audit, tax, consulting and insurance expenses which mainly relate to our recent acquisitions and $1.1 million in travel, recruiting, corporate events and infrastructure.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P64_S9	Depreciation and amortization increased due to higher depreciation from fixed asset expenditures and software development costs in 2010 and 2011.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to a decrease in out total permanent differences.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The decrease in out total permanent differences was mainly due to an increase in the amount of deductions for disqualifying dispositions related to ISOs.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity As of December 31, 2012 , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of $193.1 million .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	Our cash investments consist of corporate debt securities, bank certificate of deposits, and commercial paper.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	As specified in our investment policy, we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, the policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal, maintaining adequate liquidity at all times, and maximizing returns.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , we have no outstanding indebtedness.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	On October 20, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a five-year $100 million revolving credit facility.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	The credit facility may be increased by up to an additional $100 million on the satisfaction of certain conditions including obtaining lender commitments.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	There was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The credit facility contains certain covenants, including consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charges coverage ratios.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	The interest rates applicable to revolving loans under the credit agreement are at either (i) the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the bank s prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	We wil l pay a commitment fee during the term of the credit agreement which varies between 0.20% and 0.30% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	In connection with the proposed acquisition of Epocrates, on January 3, 2013, we borrowed $100 million from our credit facility and, on January 9, 2013, we repaid the borrowed amount in full.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	On January 7, 2013, we entered into a commitment letter, pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A. committed to increase its commitment to provide revolving loans under our credit facility by an amount up to $55 million as a source of funding for the Epocrates transaction.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P68_S5	During the first half of 2013, we anticipate amending our existing credit facility and incurring debt in order to help finance the two proposed acquisitions discussed in the Recent Developments section.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P68_S6	We believe our current and these future sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to finance our strategic initiatives, to make payments on our contractual obligations, as well as to purchase property and equipment and to finance the two pending transactions in the foreseeable future.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our analysis is supported by the growth in our new customer base and a high rate of renewal with our existing customers and the corresponding increase in billings and collections.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under these credit facilities or obtain additional financing.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Commitments We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the year 2013.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Historically, there has been no material losses related to such guarantees.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	The increase in cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 , is mainly attributable to the actual and proportionate increase in the amount of non-cash adjustments compared to the net income for those periods.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The non-cash adjustments include an increase of stock-based compensation of $8.3 million and depreciation and amortization of $10.1 million offset by a decrease in the change in fair value of the contingent consideration of $5.1 million when comparing these periods.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	The increase in stock-based compensation is a result of an increase in the fair value of recently issued stock-based awards due to an increase in the stock price.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	We continue to offset our portion of our income tax assessments with net operating losses from stock based compensation from prior years and tax benefits from current year exercises as shown by the excess tax benefit amounts.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	We no longer have significant net operating losses from prior years and expect the amount of taxes paid will increase in future years.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The year over year decrease in cash used in operating assets and liabilities is mainly driven by the change in deferred revenue.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	The increase in the deferred revenue balance of $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , is primarily due to the fact that we began waiving implementation fees for remote implementations and for some sales offerings.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The cash used by investing activities decreased $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment, capitalized software development costs, and our investment activities.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	We make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Our investment in equipment consists primarily of purchases of technology infrastructure to provide service stability and additional capacity to support our expanding client base.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	Our increase of $7.2 million in equipment is primarily related to several new servers for our new data center located in Dallas, Texas and existing data centers located in Bedford, Massachusetts, and Belfast, Maine, as well as build out of new leasehold and building improvements to accommodate our headcount growth.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our investment in software development consists of company managed-design, development, and testing of new application functionality.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	Our capitalized software development costs increased by $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 , primarily related to the new automation activities related to the new athenaCoordinator service offering as well as our athenaClinicals service offering.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	The change of restricted cash is due to the timing of the payments made for contingent consideration relating to the Anodyne acquisition completed in 2009.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2012 , we acquired Healthcare Data Services, LLC for $5.8 million.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2011 , we acquired a conference center located in Maine for $7.0 million and Proxsys for $27.9 million.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The net change in proceeds and purchases of our available for sale investments is based upon the changes in maturity of our investments in securities.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	We decreased the amount of available for sale investments at December 31, 2012 , in anticipation of the proposed acquisition of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles property that we anticipate will both close in the first half of 2013.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The cash provided by financing activities was $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to cash provided by financing activities of $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	The change is primarily attributable to the $9.7 million payment related to our debt and interest rate swap in 2011.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	We elected to repay all of our outstanding debt balances under our equipment line of credit and term loan, as well as terminate our related interest rate derivative in May 2011.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The increase of $4.6 million in cash received from the exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 , is primarily due to the overall increase in the strike price of the options exercised along with an increase in the number of options exercised during the comparable time periods.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	This increase was offset by an increase of $4.2 million related to the cash paid to settle tax obligations through the net settlement method that our employees can elect when restricted stock units vest in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	We began issuing restricted stock units in 2010 and have since experienced an increase in the proportionate number of restricted stock units granted compared to options granted.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P79_S3	We expect that the cash paid to settle tax obligations will increase in the near future as these issued restricted stock units beg in to vest.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	The payment of contingent consideration relates to the portion of the Anodyne contingent consideration that was accrued at acquisition date.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	We expect that our cash flows from financing activities will increase in the near future as we anticipate that we will need to borrow to fund the pending transactions discussed in the Recent Developments section.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	We have contractual obligations under our operating leases for properties.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2012 :
1131096_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The commitments under our operating leases shown above consist primarily of lease payments for our Watertown, Massachusetts, headquarters; our Rome, Georgia, offices; our Alpharetta, Georgia, offices; our Birmingham, Alabama, offices; our Austin, Texas, offices; and our Chennai, India, office s.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	At December 31, 2012 , $19.0 million of the $32.1 million relates to lease payments for our Watertown, Massachusetts, headquarters, see the Recent Developments section.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	Other amount consists of uncertain tax benefits.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P83_S3	We have not utilized these uncertain tax benefits, nor do we have an expectation of when these uncertain tax benefits would be challenged.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P83_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1131096_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Other than our operating leases for office space, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	None of our consolidated revenues are generated outside the United States.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	None of our vendor relationships, including our contracts with our offshore service providers International Business Machines Corporation and Vision Business Process Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), for work performed in India and the Philippines, is denominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , less than 1% of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in Chennai, India, and was incurred in Indian rupees.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investment s totaling $193.1 million at December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	These amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested pri marily in deposits, money market funds, and short-term and long-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The value of these securities, however, will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise.
1131096_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we had no outstanding long-term debt and capital lease obligations and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1131096_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are located beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 are (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2012 (the Evaluation Date ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934).
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Our management, including our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In conducting this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2012 , our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P1_S6	Deloitte and Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Changes in Internal Control There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P4_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P5_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_13_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 , of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1131096_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General - athenahealth, Inc. (the Company , we , us , or our ) is a business services company that provides ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services to its customers.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Company provides these services with the use of athenaNet, a proprietary Internet-based practice management application.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Company s customers consist of medical group practices ranging in size throughout the United States of America.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including the estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock-based compensation; (5) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (6) fair value of identifiable purchased tangible and intangible assets and contingent consideration in a business combination and (7) litigation reserves.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P18_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the customer, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	The Company derives its revenue from business services fees, implementation fees, and other services.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S2	Business services fees include amounts charged for ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services and are generally billed to the customer as a percentage of total collections.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S3	The Company does not recognize revenue for business services fees until these collections are made, as the services fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S4	Business services fees also include amounts charged to customers for generating and mailing patient statements and are recognized as the related services are performed.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S5	Implementation revenue consists primarily of professional services fees related to assisting customers with the implementation of the Company s services and are generally billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation is complete and then recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be twelve years.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S6	The Company evaluates the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on its experience with customer contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those customers will receive benefits from the Company s current portfolio of services.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S7	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S8	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P19_S9	Other services consist primarily of training, consulting services and interface fees and are recognized as the services are performed.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	Each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	The Company considers a deliverable to have standalone value if it sells this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P20_S2	Further, the Company s revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	Deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	The appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	If and when we are not able to deliver all separate units of account in the same period, we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Direct Operating Expenses - Direct operating expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients; claims processing costs; implementing new clients; and other direct costs related to collection and business services.

1131096_13_ITEM15_P23_S2	The reported amounts of direct operating expenses do not include allocated amounts for rent and overhead costs (which are included in general and administrative costs), and depreciation and amortization (which are broken out separately on the Consolidated Statements of Income), except for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Research and Development Expenses - Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and consulting fees for third-party developers.

1131096_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Scheduled maturity dates of U.S. government backed securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper purchased that are within one year are classified as short-term.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	Scheduled maturity dates of U.S. government backed securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper that are in excess of one year are classified as long-term.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	All investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P26_S3	There were no material realized gains and losses on sales of these investments for the periods presented.

1131096_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts, which are determined by establishing reserves for specific accounts and consideration of historical and estimated probable losses.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P28_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
1131096_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Financial Instruments - Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	The other financial instruments approximate their fair value, primarily because of their short-term nature.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Derivative financial instruments have been used to manage certain of the Company s interest rate exposures.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes, nor does the Company hold or issue any financial instruments for trading purposes.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P31_S2	In October 2008, the Company entered into a derivative instrument that is not designated as hedge which was terminated in May 2011.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P31_S3	The Company entered into the derivative instrument to offset the cash flow exposure associated with its interest payments on certain outstanding debt which was paid off in May 2011.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P31_S4	Derivatives are carried at fair value, as determined using standard valuation models and adjusted, when necessary, for credit risk and are separately presented on the balance sheet.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P31_S5	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings and are separately presented.

1131096_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	The airplane and land improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over 20 years and 10 years, respectively.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the asset carrying value.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P36_S3	Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P36_S4	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Restricted Cash - As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , restricted cash balances totaled $1.4 million and $5.0 million , respectively.

1131096_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Goodwill - Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	If the fair value of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P41_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Purchased Intangibles - Purchased intangibles consist of technology, non-compete agreements and customer relationships acquired in connection with business acquisitions and are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company concluded that use of the straight-line method was appropriate as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	Accrued expenses and accrued compensation - Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Deferred Rent - Deferred rent consists of rent escalation payment terms, tenant improvement allowances and other incentives received from landlords related to the Company s operating leases for its facilities.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	Rent escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which is recorded by the Company over the term of the lease, including any construction period.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	The excess is recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord as part of the negotiated terms of the lease or reimbursements of moving costs.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	These cash payments are recorded as deferred rent from landlords and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense, over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Deferred Revenue - Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	Deferred revenue includes certain deferred implementation services fees which are recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be twelve years.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P47_S2	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Business Combinations - The Company applies business combination accounting when they have acquired control over one or more businesses.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Business Combinations are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	The associated acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; non-controlling interests, if any, are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development ( IPR D ), if any, is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination, if any, are generally expensed rather than capitalized; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will affect income tax expense; and goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P49_S3	The results of the newly acquired business operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the combined entity beginning on the date of acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P49_S4	We have applied this acquisition method to the transactions described in Note 2.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, and accounts receivable.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company attempts to limit its credit risk associated with cash equivalents, investments by investing in highly rated corporate and financial institutions, and engaging with highly rated financial institutions as a counterparty to its derivative transaction.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	With respect to customer accounts receivable, the Company manages its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its customers.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P50_S3	No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues or accounts receivable as of or for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P50_S4	One customer accounted for 11% of accounts receivable as of the year ended December 31, 2012 , due to the timing of receipt of payments.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P50_S5	However, no customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P51_S2	In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P51_S3	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P51_S4	Our income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the balance sheet date to be recognized in the related period.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company s policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	Sales and Use Taxes - The Company s services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company s contractual agreements with its customers provide that payment of any sales or use taxes assessments are the responsibility of the customer.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P53_S2	In certain jurisdictions sales taxes are collected from the customer and remitted to the respective agencies.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P53_S3	These taxes are recorded on a net basis and excluded from revenue and expense in our financial statements as presented.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	Segment Reporting - Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief decision-maker ( CODM ), or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company, which uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has determined that it operates in one segment and the CODM uses non-GAAP operating income (defined as Operating Income as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income less total stock-based compensation and amortization expense related to purchased intangibles for the period) as the measure of the Company s profit on a regular basis.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value share-based awards and determine the related compensation expense.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company generally issues previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options; however the Company may reissue previously acquired treasury shares to satisfy these issuances in the future.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Foreign Currency Translation - The financial position and results of operations of the Company s foreign subsidiary are measured using local currency as the functional currency.

1131096_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	It is the Company s policy to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period however there have been no such transfers during any periods presented.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P78_S2	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as an element of consideration paid with subsequent adjustments recognized in the consolidated statement of income.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P78_S3	At the acquisition date and reporting date, the fair value of the accrued contingent consideration was determined using a probability-weighted income approach based on upside, downside and base case scenarios.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P78_S4	This approach is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which are referred to as Level 3 inputs.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , and December 31, 2011 , the Company has accrued a liability of $0.4 million and $8.2 million respectively for the estimated fair value of contingent considerations estimated to be payable upon the acquired companies reaching specific performance metrics over a specified period of operations or time after acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	The elements that make up the contingent consideration are as follows:
1131096_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	Based on the actual operational performance for the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company paid $2.4 million relating to the first potential contingent consideration in March of 2011 .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The second potential contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Anodyne in 2009 ranged from zero to $2.9 million and was payable in quarterly installments based upon the cross selling of the Company s services for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the six-month period ended June 30, 2012.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	Any amounts not earned in the first potential contingent consideration could be earned under the second potential contingent consideration in excess of the initial $2.9 million bringing the total second potential contingent consideration to $5.3 million .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P80_S3	On December 31, 2011, the Company estimated the fair value of the second contingent consideration at $1.4 million based on key assumptions including a probability adjusted level of 50% for the base case scenario and 25% for the upside and downside scenarios.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P80_S4	The significant judgment related to the estimated earn-out payments by scenario was primarily based on the Company s i) past experience of our cross selling, ii) past experience of the timeline for converting pipeline opportunities into customers and iii) the remaining time period of this contingent consideration.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	At December 31, 2011, a large cross sell customer opportunity was included in the upside scenario which had a 25% probability.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	On March 31, 2012, the Company estimated the fair value of the second contingent consideration at $3.4 million based on key assumptions including a 20% for the base case scenario, 70% for the upside scenario and 10% for the downside scenario.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	At March 31, 2012, this large cross sell opportunity was in final contract negotiations with the Company and therefore a higher probability was assigned to the upside scenario.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S3	The time period through which the contingent consideration could be earned elapsed on June 30, 2012.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S4	The Company accrued $1.8 million as of June 30, 2012, for the final payment based on the final cross selling results which was paid during the three months ended September 30, 2012.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S5	The change in fair value of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , is an increase in the general and administrative line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S6	The Company paid $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 , and $3.9 million over the entire term of the second contingent consideration.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S7	The first potential contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Proxsys LLC ( Proxsys ) in 2011 ranges from zero to $3.0 million and is payable in one installment in the first quarter of 2013 based upon revenue and new sales performance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S8	In order to qualify for the earnout payment, the acquired subsidiary must have achieved a minimum revenue threshold which was derived from both recurring revenue and revenue generated from new customers brought onto the service after the acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S9	Once that minimum revenue threshold is met, the amount of the payment is then determined by new sales of the Company s athenaCoordinator service offering since date of acquisition.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S10	At acquisition date and on December 31, 2011, the Company estimated the fair value of the first potential contingent consideration at $2.4 million , the key assumptions relating to this potential contingent consideration included the athenaCoordinator revenue budget for the 2012 fiscal year, which included recurring revenue and estimates related new revenue generated from new customers based upon the existing sales pipeline and historical implementation timeline and a probability adjusted level of 60% for the base case and 25% and 15% for the upside and downside scenarios, respectively.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S11	The athenaCoordinator revenue budget for the 2012 fiscal year exceeded the minimum revenue threshold.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S12	The downside scenarios included a worse case scenario where the acquired subsidiary did not achieve the minimum revenue target.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S13	Certain contracts that were in an advanced negotiation stage at December 31, 2011, and estimated to close in the first quarter of 2012, did not close during the three months ended March 31, 2012; therefore as of March 31, 2012, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the minimum revenue threshold for athenaCoordinator will not be achieved by a margin of 5 - 10% .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S14	On March 31, 2012, the Company determined that based on the reforecasted amounts and the pass fail structure of this contingent payment, the probability percentages have been adjusted to 90% for the worse case scenario and 10% for the upside scenario.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S15	On March 31, 2012, the Company estimated the fair value of the first potential contingent consideration at $0.3 million .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S16	On June 30, 2012, the Company estimated the fair value of the first potential contingent consideration to have no valu e.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S17	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , the Company did not meet the minimum revenue threshold therefore zero consideration was earned related to the first contingent consideration.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S18	The change in fair value of $2.4 million is a decrease in the genera l and administrative expense line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S19	The second potential contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Proxsys in 2011 ranges from zero to $5.0 million and is payable in quarterly installments based upon the cross selling of the Company s athenaCollector services into Proxsys new and acquired customer and physician sender base, from acquisition to the second year anniversary of the acquisition in the third quarter of 2013.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P81_S20	On December 31, 2011, and through June 30, 2012, the key assumptions relating to this potential contingent consideration included scenarios primarily based on the Company s (i) past experience of our cross selling related to the Anodyne acquisition, (ii) past experience of the timeline for converting pipeline opportunities into customers and (iii) the remaining time period of this contingent consideration and a probability adjusted level of 65% for the base case and 25% and 10% for the upside and downside scenarios, respectively.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company lowered its expectations of achievable cross sells within the earn out period for all scenarios and has a probability adjusted level of 60% for the base case and 20% for the upside and downside scena rios.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration at December 31, 2012 , to be $0.4 million , primarily related to the amount of time left to earn the additional consideration.
1131096_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	The change in fair value of $4.0 million is a decrease in the general and administrative expense line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .

( Epocrates Healthcare Data Services LLC; Modality, Inc.; and Proxsys LLC, and any subsidiary that may be acquired or formed in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on August 21, 1997, as Athena Healthcare Incorporated.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	We changed our name to athenahealth.com, Inc. on March 31, 2000, and to athenahealth, Inc. on November 17, 2000.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Overview athenahealth provides cloud-based business services that help medical caregivers collect more revenue and greatly reduce their administrative work burden.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	By combining three distinct but interconnected components cloud-based software ( Software ), networked knowledge ( Knowledge ), and back-office work ( Work ) athenahealth empowers its clients to achieve and sustain financial health while staying focused on quality patient care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our services are designed to minimize the hassles that caregivers and their staff face from complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many related tasks that can take attention away from delivering care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P2_S3	We differentiate our offerings by continuously updating and improving our services via our cloud-based network, athenaNet.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	As a web-based platform, athenaNet can be quickly implemented by our staff, with low upfront costs to clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	We do not charge licensing or hosting fees.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	We offer a suite of four, seamlessly integrated services: athenaCollector for revenue cycle and practice management; athenaClinicals for electronic health records ( EHR athenaCommunicator for automated, live, and online patient communications; and athenaCoordinator for care coordination.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P3_S3	We also offer subscription-based and sponsored clinical information and decision support services under the Epocrates brand.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Cloud-based Software Via the athenaNet platform, we provide a single instance of cloud-based software to clients; every health care provider across the network always access the same continuously updated services.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our software is the primary conduit through which we exchange information among clients, insurance payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The athenaNet platform enables every client to benefit from the collective knowledge of all other clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	These learnings are culled and implemented through our patented billing rules engine ( Rules Engine ) and clinical quality management engine, collectively called athenaRules.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	As we work with clients, insurance payers, and other partners, more expert knowledge is infused into each service, making the network smarter and more powerful for all clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	The network s shared knowledge and transparency also allows clients to monitor and benchmark their performance against those of other practices across the network.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Back-office Work Our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	These services range from receiving, scanning, and delivering incoming faxes to tracking claims with insurance payers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	We automate these processes whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work ourselves.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	This unique combination of Software, Knowledge, and Work is the core of our aligned success model: we charge clients a percentage of collections, in most cases, connecting our financial results directly to that of our clients and our ability to drive revenue for them.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P6_S4	This framework of shared financial interest demands and inspires a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We first released athenaCollector in 2000, followed by athenaClinicals in 2006.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	We then introduced athenaCommunicator in 2010, the result of our first acquisition, Crest Line Technologies, LLC (d.b.a. MedicalMessaging.net).
1131096_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	Expansion continued with the following acquisitions: in October 2009, Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. ( Anodyne ), developer of business intelligence tools; in August 2011, Proxsys LLC ( Proxsys ), a leading provider of cloud-based care coordination services; in October 2012, Healthcare Data Services LLC, which offers patient population health management services; and in March 2013, Epocrates.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Epocrates is recognized for developing a leading medical application among U.S. physicians for clinical content, practice tools, and health industry engagement at the point of care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	In 2013, we generated revenue of $595.0 million from the sale of our services, compared to $422.3 million in 2012 and $324.1 million in 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , there were 50,212 medical providers, including 35,858 physicians, using our athenaCollector service across 49 states and the District of Columbia and across 92 medical specialties.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The health care industry is complex and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that cannot support the current needs for collaboration, flexibility, and interoperability.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	A disproportionate amount of communication still takes place on paper instead of via automated communications.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	This combination of outdated, inflexible systems and paper workflows creates significant costs for health care organizations, which suffer sizable administrative work, duplicated efforts, and errors.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	By addressing these problems, medical caregivers can focus on the practice of medicine and free their staff to spend time on higher-value tasks.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	Practice-based activities required to ensure appropriate payment for services rendered have increased in number and complexity for the following reasons:
1131096_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Legislative reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), is expected to drive many fundamental shifts in the health care reimbursement landscape.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Millions of additional patients could be required to purchase health insurance coverage.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Health insurers have introduced a wide range of benefit structures, many of which are customized to the unique goals of particular employer groups.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	procedures, and to address changing employer demands.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	This has resulted in an increase in the rules regarding who is eligible for health care services, what health care services are eligible for reimbursement, and who is responsible to pay for health care services delivered.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	It has also resulted in more plans that require a larger proportion of patient contribution for services delivered; these increase the burden on practices to manage and pursue receivables directly with the patient.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Practices need to be continually aware of the diversity and dynamic nature of health benefit plan design.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	While the fee-for-service framework can be complicated enough, rapidly emerging outcome-based payment models are even more complex, requiring caregivers to capture and provide appropriate data to obtain payments.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	Accountable care programs also require a much greater focus on care coordination and cost efficiency across multiple caregivers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	To complicate reimbursement even further, some models, such as Pay-For-Performance, demand that caregivers first identify programs for which they are eligible, and then enroll, identify eligible patients, and record relevant billing and clinical data for each eligible encounter.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	These newer models continue to evolve and grow in both number and complexity.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Financial incentives for the use of EHRs .
1131096_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	The federal government enacted a financial incentive program through the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act ) for caregivers who demonstrate Meaningful Use of a certified EHR technology.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	While payments under the program do not represent a sustained market opportunity, they have shifted buying patterns since they were instituted, with many caregivers accelerating their purchase of EHRs and making revenue cycle decisions tied to an EHR selection.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	In addition to administering typical business functions, caregivers must dedicate significant time and resources to physician orders, including referrals to specialists, imaging centers, laboratories, pharmacies, and inpatient admissions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	This requires a series of communications that ensure the care is appropriate and eligible for reimbursement.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	To process these communications, medical practices often interact with multiple software systems; manage communications via fax, and are challenged with having to contact patients, payers, and other trading partners to effectively exchange the right information to accompany the order.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our mission is to be caregivers most trusted service, helping them do well doing the right thing.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	In almost all cases, we price our services as a percentage of practice collections, a strategy that incentivizes us to improve organization performance and reduce cost through more efficient operations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	As practices face rising costs and complexity, they need solutions for a diverse set of problems, including the ever increasing administrative work driven by that increased complexity, including new, more complicated reimbursement models; partners demand for electronic data exchange; pressure to adopt expensive EHRs; continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards; new insurance payer rules; and the challenges of collecting payments from uninsured, underinsured, and high deductible health plan patients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	We believe the traditional software model fails to address these needs.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	As a system of limited connectivity and flexibility, conventional software does not allow for rapid, intelligent evolution of system functionality and client needs.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S5	Additionally, locally installed software favors larger organizations that can afford a sizable up-front investment in hardware and software, plus the staff to manage and maintain these systems.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S6	In contrast, cloud-based software can solve a greater set of problems because it can quickly be updated and delivered to all clients as a single, shared instance of software without expensive installations or upgrades.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S7	But there are challenges that require cloud-based software to have corresponding service components, such as processing and sorting a practice s incoming paper documents; identifying and managing payer rules; and having a live operator take patient phone calls after a practice closes for the day.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S8	Bringing these services, and many more, to our cloud-based software, is the crux of our cloud-based services model.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S9	As our software delivers the right knowledge to the right person at the right time, our back-office services execute work, at scale, that would otherwise fall upon the practice.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S10	The connectivity and system infrastructure we provide would normally be out of reach for small independent practices, which make up a large portion of the caregiver market.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S11	However, because we automate processes and scale work across our entire provider network, we can efficiently deliver our services to medical practices of every size.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S12	By giving small practices the same technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefits not only to those practices, but also to their clinical exchange and trading partners with whom they share vital information.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S13	As practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility enhances our ability to compete, regardless of whether a practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P17_S14	Key elements of our strategy include:
1131096_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Remaining intensely focused on our clients success .
1131096_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	loyalty (proven through high and sustained client satisfaction and retention); and enhances our reputation in the marketplace.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	As newer payment models continue to integrate cost efficiency and outcomes into reimbursement formulas, new activities will become more important in driving performance.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Only practices that can fully integrate these activities with their revenue cycle will have visibility into their true financial health.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	These can include coordinating care smoothly with other caregivers, directly tying lab results back to the right patient records, and delivering patient adherence reminders.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	We proactively demonstrate that when our integrated services are fully adopted and optimized, we help medical caregivers manage and monitor performance comprehensively.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	We actively seek out new payer rules and new revenue opportunities for practices, and use our Rules Engine to deliver relevant information to the right person at the right time.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our Rules Engine identifies problems before claims are submitted.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	This increases the percentage of transactions that are successfully executed on the first attempt and reduces the time it takes to fully resolve claims or other transactions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The rules embedded in athenaClinicals are becoming increasingly tied to reimbursement as Pay-for-Reporting, Pay-for-Performance, shared savings, and other bonus payments require specific action at the point of care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	Without the type of automation found in our quality management engine, these payment programs would plague physicians with an administrative burden, significantly impairing their ability to practice.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Increasing awareness and attracting new clients .
1131096_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that our cloud-based business services provide significant value for medical practices and health systems of any size, and we continue to expand sales and marketing efforts to address our market opportunity and aggressively seek new clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our athenaCollector client base currently represents approximately five percent of the addressable U.S. market, comprised of an estimated 684,000 physicians practicing in the ambulatory segment.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	Our marketing efforts focus not only on small and group practices, but also on hospitals, health systems, and health services companies, with programs and services that can help them manage their affiliated and employed physician strategies.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	According to an independent third-party study, physician awareness of athenahealth increased from 31% in 2012 to 39% in 2013, a 26% increase.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	We believe that raising our awareness is critical to our growth strategy.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Uncovering and delivering new sources of revenue to clients .
1131096_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	We work closely with payers and other health care trading partners to demonstrate the efficiencies and reduction in administrative work that our services provide.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	We believe that, as these partners gain greater understanding of these advantages and system-wide benefits, they will continue to reward these efficiencies in a manner that accrues direct benefits for our clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Maintaining high levels of user adoption and improving through network transparency .
1131096_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	One of the biggest challenges for traditional EHR software vendors has been a lack of physician adoption.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	While adoption rates are improving, many physicians still fear that EHRs will slow them down.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	Because of our large services operation, we can: support many alternate documentation styles that are not available with software-only solutions; integrate multiple activities into our complete suite of services; and work to continually improve our services ease of use for providers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	Our clients can realize significant benefits by using our EHR, which drives our high adoption rate.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P29_S4	We convert EHR usage data into key indicators of top practice performance, individual clinician performance, and the associated drivers of each, and can then share this intelligence across our entire network of clients to help optimize performance.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Expanding our client base and service offerings through the acquisition of Epocrates.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	We acquired Epocrates for the assembled workforce, expected synergies, accelerated awareness of our services across the health care market, and opportunity to deliver additional high-value information to the clinical community.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	Our loyal network of more than one million health care professionals using our Epocrates services, including approximately 50 percent of U.S. physicians, routinely access these intuitive solutions to help streamline workflow and improve patient care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	These services are referenced multiple times per day and help health care professionals make more informed prescribing decisions, improve workflow, and enhance patient safety.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	We anticipate that our continuing integration of these services with those we offer through athenaNet will improve the quality of information available at the point of care, leading to better outcomes and an increase in the overall desirability of our services.

1131096_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Because athenaCollector is web-based, it provides our clients with the benefits of athenaRules and enables them to interact with our service operations team to efficiently monitor workflows.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	athenaCollector also includes a full set of reporting tools so that users can track their ongoing performance and benchmark against other practices.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Knowledge Medical practices route their day-to-day electronic and paper-based payer communications to us, which we then process using our patented Rules Engine and service operations to avoid reimbursement delays and improve practice performance.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our proprietary database of payer knowledge contains information amassed over years of experience in handling the physician workflow for thousands of medical practices, with medical claims from tens of thousands of health benefit packages.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	The core focus of the database is on the payer rules, which are the key drivers of claim payment and denials.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	By understanding denials, we can add rules to the database that help the entire client base avoid future denials, resulting in increased automation of our workflow processes.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	athenaRules interact seamlessly within the medical office workflow and with our service operations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Work athenahealth service operations consist of both knowledgeable staff and technological infrastructure used to execute the key steps associated with proper handling of physician claims and clinical data management.

1131096_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	athenaNet provides comprehensive reporting on a range of clinical results.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	This includes distribution of different procedure codes (leveling), incidence of different diagnoses, timeliness of turnaround by lab companies and other intermediaries, and other key performance indicators.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	As reporting and quality programs have collectively become a greater portion of physician revenue, clinical data must be captured according to the requirements and incentives of different payers and plans.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	This can be very difficult to manage on paper or in a static software system.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	for-Performance and outcome-based programs, including Medicare incentive payments under the HITECH Act; access medication formularies; and identify potential medication errors (such as drug-to-drug interactions or allergy reactions).
1131096_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Work Medical practices that use an EHR can still receive a substantial number of clinical documents from third parties, creating a significant administrative burden.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our service operations capture inbound paper documents, convert them to electronic format, attach them to the appropriate patient chart, classify them according to type, and associate results with the original order where applicable.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Additionally, even if the physician creates an order in the EHR, the intended recipient may not accept orders electronically; in that case, our service operations team converts the electronically generated order to paper for delivery on the practice s behalf.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	We also perform many of the Pay-for-Performance program identification and enrollment tasks on behalf of practices so they can participate without significant up-front research and effort.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	athenaCommunicator athenaCommunicator is a series of patient communication services, including automated patient messaging, live operator services, and an online patient portal.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	By encouraging patient engagement and maintaining a connection between patients and providers beyond the practice, athenaCommunicator services help reduce patient no-show rates and improve overall schedule density, increasing the number of revenue-generating appointments for our clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	The ability to increase patient outreach helps provide clinical education and adherence reminders to patients, which improves the quality of care and outcomes without increasing practice demand to monitor and contact patients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	The automated services can be used to remind patients of appointments as well as self-pay balances, helping practices drive patient collections.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	Together, these services provide a personalized, high-quality experience for patients while driving practice performance.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	Software athenaCommunicator enables practices to manage many patient communication tasks electronically, including: delivering automated reminders with customizable criteria and opt-out functionality; creation of a self-service patient portal for patients to request appointments, pay bills, and exchange secure messages with the practice; and automatic generation of e-mails to patients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P42_S6	Automated phone calls are multi-purpose and may include appointment reminders, outbound population health campaigns, and follow-up on outstanding balances, while prompting patients to make payments by mail, telephone, or online.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Knowledge athenaCommunicator enables practices to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	They can set patient or group-specific communication preferences that will automatically tailor communications to the preferred timing and mode of delivery, including phone call, e-mail, or patient portal.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	These communication rules allow each patient to receive a personalized experience, including delivery of messages with branding and using the Caller ID of the practice, if desired.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Work Practices spend a great deal of time fielding phone calls from patients, on topics ranging from scheduling requests and clinical cases to driving directions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	As part of the athenaCommunicator service, we provide live operators who field calls on behalf of practices, especially beneficial during peak phone call periods or after hours.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	The live operator service includes redirecting automated calls for appointment scheduling, patient payments, and message-taking.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P44_S3	Additionally, we print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of the practice to assist with patient payment collection.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P44_S4	Collectively, these activities expand the availability of the office to patients and help alleviate practice phone burden, freeing staff to focus on more critical tasks.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	athenaCoordinator athenaCoordinator is a referral cycle management tool that helps streamline the disorganized system of patient care coordination.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	The connections between practices and points of patient referral are rife with inefficiencies due to patient data redundancies, manual inputs, and errors, resulting in additional practice workload and patient dissatisfaction.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	With athenaCoordinator, caregivers can efficiently deliver a clean referral order to a physician, hospital, or other supply-chain partner.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	This much-needed improvement in today s health care reduces unnecessary phone calls and faxes, eliminates redundancies, and greatly reduces both the error rate and patient frustration.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Beginning in 2014, athenaCoordinator includes our financial and operations management and our population health management services.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	These services are the result of the integration of the Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. (financial and operations management) and Healthcare Data Services LLC (population health management) acquisitions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	The union of these services provides visibility into the financial and clinical health of the health care network, helping health care organizations manage both networks of caregivers and populations of patients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	By harmonizing data across practice management systems, EHRs, and claims systems, athenaCoordinator provides health care organizations with a single source of truth.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	athenaCoordinator turns insight into action, guiding data-driven decision-making at the point of care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	participate more effectively in new payment models that aim to create a reimbursement system that links care reimbursement to the quality of care delivered and, ultimately, to reduce overall health care expenses for patient populations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	In the future, we plan to expand our offerings to visually present other data sets, such as clinical and patient cycle metrics.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Software athenaCoordinator allows providers, via an easy-to-use online portal, to electronically prepare and send a clean order for a referral-meaning all the pertinent information needed to streamline care coordination is complete-and a patient can arrive at his or her appointment with another physician, or at a hospital or lab, with information already entered and verified.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	This type of efficient information transfer delivers benefits to both the referring and receiving providers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	For the initial caregiver, athenaCoordinator reduces time spent managing outbound orders and can provide greater visibility to patient status after the referring visit.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	For the receiving caregiver, athenaCoordinator reduces denials, the time spent processing referrals, and the risk of acting on erroneous information.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	Referring providers who use athenaClinicals can also receive a detailed care summary of the referral, effectively closing the loop of patient care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	that data visually through a wide array of business performance metrics.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our population health management service also allows clients to gather claims, health plan administrative, and clinical data from client health care organizations and combine those data into a single data asset that can be used by the client to coordinate care, reduce health care utilization, and address gaps in care across its patient population.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	As part of a streamlined path of coordinated care information, our Rules Engine automatically determines a patient s insurance eligibility after a referring provider enters an order via the web-based portal.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	This cuts down on the need for practice staff to manually contact an insurer and allows a patient to arrive at a receiving provider with his or her coverage eligibility already confirmed.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	Both the patient and the receiving hospital or lab staff can then focus on care and not get bogged down with insurance eligibility research at the point of care.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S5	Work Preparing referral orders can often require office staff to spend time managing administrative duties and they will often not receive follow-up information after a patient has visited a referred lab, physician, or hospital.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S6	As part of athenaCoordinator, our staff takes over this work, benefiting both the referring and receiving providers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P52_S7	Our back-office operations will verify insurance and benefits with payers, secure pre-certification, handle patient registration, collect self-pay from the patient, and electronically deliver the order to the receiving provider in advance of the patient visit.

1131096_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	In addition to the services described above, we also provide client support services, many taking place on a regular basis, including:
1131096_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	active, real-time performance monitoring for clients with complex and highly scaled operations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Sales and Marketing We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of physicians, medical groups, and health systems.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	We expect to expand our network by selling our complete suite of services to new clients, and cross-selling additional services into our client base.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is divided into three groups: the enterprise team, which is dedicated to serving the very largest managed care organizations, as well as those with high growth potential; the group team, which is dedicated to medical practices with seven to 150 physicians; and the small group team, which is dedicated to practices with one to six physicians.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P62_S4	Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P62_S5	Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients, we conduct a consultative sales process, which includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Channel Partners In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	We refer to these third parties as channels and the individuals and organizations involved as our channel partners.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for providing us sales lead information that result in sales.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	These channel partners typically do not make direct sales.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as an independent sales representative, a purchasing agent (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or a joint marketer of combined service offerings that we jointly develop with that third party.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P63_S5	In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P63_S6	Our channel relationships include state medical societies, health care information technology product companies, health care product distribution companies, consulting firms, group purchasing organizations, health systems, regional extension centers, and payers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	Marketing Initiatives Since our service model is new to most physicians, our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so they will view our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	Our marketing initiatives are generally targeted toward specific segments of the medical practice market.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition in the marketplace.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Our primary competition uses locally installed software to manage the various clinical and financial workflow needs within the physician s office.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	Other nationwide competitors offer services they refer to as on-demand or software-as-a-service models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Companies that sell practice management, EHR, and care coordination software and services include: Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; CareCloud Corporation; Cerner Corporation; eClinicalWorks, LLC; Epic Systems Corporation; Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc.; McKesson Corp.; NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC; OptumInsight, Inc.; Practice Fusion, Inc.; SCI Solutions, Inc.; and Vitera Healthcare Solutions, LLC, which operates under the Greenway brand.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
1131096_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	However, some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with health care providers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	As a result, these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	These companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, and patent prosecution and litigation and to finance capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	Our Epocrates services compete for users of the types of clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	Competitors providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	The primary competition for pharmaceutical promotional spend comes from companies, such as WebMD, that offer other marketing channels to health care professionals.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our market research business competes with companies that recruit physicians for surveys and the recruitment arms of market research companies that have their own survey panels of health care professionals.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	We compete primarily on our ability to reach and communicate with health care professionals under the Epocrates brand, which is recognized and endorsed among health care professionals as a trusted and accurate source of drug and clinical information; the breadth and loyalty of this large and active network is not easily replicated, and it enhances our ability to market our sponsored services.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the services we provide are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws, including regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as additional regulation.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Government Regulation of Health Information HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules .
1131096_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it (collectively, HIPAA ) contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	These are embodied in the Privacy Rule and Security Rule portions of HIPAA.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules apply directly to covered entities, such as health care providers who engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P73_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from the HIPAA-prescribed electronic forms and other forms, we are a clearinghouse and therefore a covered entity.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	In order to serve as a business associate for our clients and provide them with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires the execution of business associate agreements.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Such agreements obligate us to provide adequate written assurances that we will properly safeguard the privacy and security of protected health information exchanged pursuant to each agreement.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	We also must enter into business associate agreements with entities who act as business associates for us.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to health care billing be conducted using prescribed electronic formats.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	As a covered entity subject to HIPAA, we must meet these requirements, and, moreover, we must structure and provide our services in a way that supports our clients HIPAA compliance obligations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	HITECH Act and HIPAA Omnibus Rule .
1131096_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	The HITECH Act, the regulations issued under it, and the corresponding amendments to the HIPAA regulations in the recently promulgated HIPAA Omnibus Rule have altered and enhanced our obligations with respect to protected health information.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	While we are in compliance with currently applicable requirements, we will need to implement additional measures to address provisions with future effective dates.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	In addition to HIPAA and the HITECH Act, most states have enacted laws related to the security of confidential medical information.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and the HITECH Act, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Government Regulation of Reimbursement Our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	Given the breadth of these laws, they are potentially applicable to our business activities, including the transactions that we undertake on behalf of our clients and the financial arrangements through which we market, sell, and distribute our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	Accordingly, we are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government health care programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	During recent years, there have been numerous legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement future reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement under government programs that adversely affect our business, our client base, or our cost of providing our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Fraud and Abuse A number of federal and state laws, loosely referred to as fraud and abuse laws, prohibit a variety of activities that could result in excessive expenditure of funds on health care, such as the payment of kickbacks, fraudulent billing, and referrals for health care services where a conflict of interest exists.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	These laws include, but are not limited to: Anti-Kickback Laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	Courts have construed the federal Anti-Kickback Law broadly to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of one of the arrangements is to encourage patient referrals or other federal health care program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	There are several limited and narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	There are numerous federal and state criminal and civil laws that forbid, among other things, the submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse in connection with such submission and payment, for example, by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing for the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	How these concepts apply to services such as ours that rely substantially on automated processes has not been well defined in the regulations or relevant case law.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P83_S3	As a result, our errors with respect to the formatting, preparation, or transmission of such claims and any mishandling by us of claims information that is supplied by our clients or other third parties may be determined to be, or may be alleged to be, false claims under a false claims law.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	In addition to the provisions relating to health care access, financing, and delivery, the ACA made changes to health care fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	The ACA expands false claim laws, amends key provisions of other anti-fraud and abuse statutes, provides the government with new enforcement tools and funding for enforcement, and enhances both criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	The ACA may result in increased anti-fraud enforcement activities.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and health care entities.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	Physicians are prohibited from referring patients for certain designated health services reimbursed under certain federal healthcare programs to entities with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, unless such referrals fall within a specific exception.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	Reimbursement claims that we submit for care rendered under forbidden referrals could be deemed false or fraudulent, resulting in liability under other fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope and may not be limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government health care program.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	In many states, there are laws that prohibit non-licensed persons from practicing medicine, prevent corporations from employing licensed practitioners, and prohibit licensed medical practitioners from practicing medicine in collaboration with non-physicians, including business corporations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	Some states also prohibit physicians from splitting their professional fees with non-physicians.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of the physician clients collections or charges.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P87_S3	There are also federal and state laws that forbid or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P87_S4	Some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P87_S5	In particular, the Medicare program specifically requires that billing agents who receive Medicare payments on behalf of healthcare providers must meet certain requirements, and the agent s compensation may not be related in any way to the amount billed or collected or the actual collection of payment.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P87_S6	Medicaid regulations similarly provide that Medicaid payments may be received by billing agents in the name of their clients without violating anti-assignment requirements if payment to the agent is related to the cost of the billing service, not related on a percentage basis to the amount billed or collected, and not dependent on collection of payment.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	Electronic Prescribing Laws States have differing prescription format and signature requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	Due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	In addition, effective on January 1, 2006, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated its final E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program regulations.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	prescription and other information transmitted electronically in connection with a drug benefit covered by the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	These standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	Aspects of our services are affected by such regulation, as our clients need to comply with these requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	Anti-Tampering Laws For certain prescriptions that cannot or may not be transmitted electronically from physician to pharmacy, both federal and state laws require that the written forms used exhibit anti-tampering features.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	For example, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 requires that most prescriptions covered by Medicaid must demonstrate security features that prevent copying, erasing, or counterfeiting of the written form.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	Because our clients will, on occasion, need to use printed forms, we must take these laws into consideration for purposes of the prescription functions of our athenaClinicals service.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	Electronic Health Records Certification Requirements The HITECH Act directs the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, or ONCHIT, to support and promote meaningful use of certified EHR technology nationwide through the adoption of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria programs.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	In January 2011, HHS issued a final rule to establish a permanent certification program for EHR technology.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	Our athenaClinicals service has been certified as a 2014 Edition Complete EHR in accordance with the applicable certification criteria.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	United States Food and Drug Administration The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices and a proposed rule for reclassification of medical device data systems under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	The FDA has stated that health information technology software is a medical device under the FDCA, and we expect that the FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in health care settings regardless of whether the draft policy or proposed rule is finalized or changed.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	We anticipate additional guidance on this subject by mid-2014, in the form of a report to be issued by the FDA, ONCHIT, and the Federal Communications Commission.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	This report would propose a regulatory framework for health information technology that promotes innovation, protects patient safety, and avoids regulatory duplication.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	If our computer software functionality is considered a medical device under the FDCA, we could be subject to additional regulatory requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	FDA regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and import and export.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	FDA requirements with respect to devices that are determined to pose lesser risk to the public include:
1131096_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecutions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	Foreign Regulations Our subsidiary in Chennai, India, is subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	These regulations include Indian federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws, and qualification for tax status and tax incentives.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	We have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P96_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , we held eleven U.S. patents, two foreign patents, with twenty U.S. patent applications pending and seven foreign patent applications pending.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P96_S3	Our issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2020 and 2031.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P96_S4	We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to protect our brand.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P96_S5	We will continue to file and prosecute applications for patents and trademarks when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies and our brand.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P96_S6	While our patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe the following factors are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage:
1131096_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	a continued focus on the improved financial results of our clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have a policy of requiring employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S2	In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S3	Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S4	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of medical practices and our clients in the pharmaceutical industry.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S5	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S6	Our pharmaceutical clients budgeting process impacts the timing of revenue related to sales of sponsored clinical information and decision support services, which has historically been highest in the fourth quarter.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P98_S7	In addition, as further explained in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2013 , we had 2,966 full-time employees, with 1,533 in service operations, 473 in sales and marketing, 676 in research and development, and 284 in general and administrative functions.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	Of these full-time employees, 2,667 were located in the U.S. and 299 were located in Chennai, India.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	The financial information required under this Item 1 is incorporated herein by reference to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1131096_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other securities filings unless specifically incorporated herein by reference.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	The public may read and copy these materials at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P101_S3	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P101_S4	In addition, our filings with the SEC may be accessed through the SEC s Interactive Data Electronic Applications ( IDEA ) system at http://www.sec.gov.
1131096_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	All statements made in any of our securities filings, including all forward-looking statements or information, are made as of the date of the document in which the statement is included, and we do not assume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS GENERAL We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The provision by third parties of revenue cycle services to medical practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty, a limited set of payers, or a limited geographical area.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We anticipate that the software, statistical, and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Revenue cycle and clinical cycle software for medical practices has historically been dominated by large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these entities are now offering on-demand services or a software-as-a-service model under which software is centrally administered, and these vendors may also provide administrative services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The size, financial strength, and breadth of offerings of the larger entities is increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and health care industries.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect large integrated technology companies to continue to become more active in our markets, both through acquisition and internal investment.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, a few smaller companies have started providing single-instance, Internet-based software using a model similar to ours; the offerings of these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage of our services and impact our market share.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Further, while the market for patient communication and referral management services is growing and is not as yet dominated by a small group of vendors with significant resources, our patient and referral cycle services face competition from a wide variety of market participants.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S7	For example, certain health systems have developed their own patient portals or referral management systems.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S8	If we fail to distinguish our patient and referral cycle offerings from the other options available to health care providers, the demand for and market share of those offerings may decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S9	In regard to our Epocrates services, we compete with other companies for users of the types of drug and clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from our pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S10	We compete within a broad industry of health care content providers for the attention of health care professionals who can choose to use mobile, online or print media to reference clinical information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Companies providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S12	Competition from each of these sources of clinical reference content may lead to a loss of our existing network members and a reduction in the rate at which we attract new members for our clinical information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S13	Our primary competition for the promotional spend available from our pharmaceutical clients in the area of interactive services is from companies, including WebMD, that help such companies market their products, programs, and services to health care professionals.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S14	Our market research business competes with numerous companies that recruit physicians to participate in surveys in a variety of formats, as well as the recruitment arms of market research companies that have assembled their own survey panels of health care professionals.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S15	To the extent competing channels are available to access health care professionals, including physicians, the value of our interactive services to our clients is reduced.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S16	Some of our current large competitors, such as Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Epic Systems Corporation; GE Healthcare; McKesson Corp.; Quality Systems, Inc.; Sage Software Healthcare, Inc.; and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S17	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S18	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P3_S19	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Further, in light of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition to new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target markets.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but that offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we are unable to retain existing members of our Epocrates network and attract new members, especially physician members with desired characteristics for our interactive services who actively participate in those services, our revenue will decline, the anticipated benefits of our Epocrates acquisition may not be realized, and our business will suffer.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Most of the members of our Epocrates network use only our free drug reference product and may stop using the products at any time without loss.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Members who subscribe to our premium drug and clinical reference products usually do so for a term of one year and have no obligation to renew their subscriptions when such subscriptions expire.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Under certain circumstances, our members may cancel their subscriptions prior to expiration.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Factors that may affect the retention rate of our existing members and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools include:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Unless we are able to provide current, relevant, and reliable health care content, drug and clinical reference tools, formulary hosting, and other services that meet and continue to meet the needs of health care professionals, including physicians, the value of those services to new and existing members will decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our provision of such services depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified physician and pharmacist editors and authors, license accurate and relevant content from third parties, contract with health plans and insurers to host formulary information, monitor and respond to changes in member interest in specific topics, and develop new or enhanced services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we cannot meet our staffing needs or develop or acquire needed content at a reasonable cost, if there are errors or omissions in such content, if our competitors obtain exclusive access to or develop content that health care professionals consider superior to ours, or if we cannot meet the needs of our members, the value of our content and services would diminish.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The reputation of our Epocrates brand is dependent in large part on the medical community s continued perception of us as independent from our health care industry clients, particularly pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If health care professionals believe that we are too closely associated with such clients as a result of the revenue we receive from their purchase or sponsorship of our interactive services, the credibility of our brand will diminish.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Although we take precautions to remain independent from our health care industry clients, including separating the development of our application content from our commercial dealings with such clients and clearly labeling the source and responsibility of sponsored messages, programs, and activities, we cannot assure you that the medical community will view our content as sufficiently unbiased.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If the reputation of our brand is damaged, it will be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to restore the quality of our brand with health care professionals and our business could suffer.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If the developers of mobile operating systems and mobile devices with which our products and services are compatible fail to remain competitive in the marketplace and to be adopted into medical practice and practice workflow, members will be less inclined to use our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing products and services, including mobile, Web-based, and traditional products and services offered by competitors or through online resources and searches may affect our retention rate and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The availability of download sites such as the Apple App Store SM that offer numerous free or low-priced competing products at one location has also reduced the demand for our paid subscription products.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We expect the use of such sites to expand, reducing the number of paying members for our drug and clinical reference tools as a percentage of total members.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition to the loss of subscription revenue, our inability to attract or retain members, especially physician members with desired characteristics, such as specialty and prescribing habits, who update their mobile devices through our servers with sufficient frequency, may cause an even more significant decline in revenue from our interactive services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients are attracted to our large, engaged member network for the delivery of their clinical messages, formularies, and other sponsored content, and, without sufficient active members who meet desired criteria, those clients may reduce their subscription for our interactive services, and our revenue may decline.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Even if the number of our members is not materially reduced, their participation in our services may decrease, which could impact our revenues.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P8_S7	We have established limits on the number and the mix of sponsored and non-sponsored messages delivered to members in order to promote the quality of members experience with our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	members update during a given service period, or the demand for promotional clinical messaging sponsorship exceeds the available supply, our health care clients could become dissatisfied with our service.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	As a result, we may be unable to grow our interactive services revenue beyond the bounds we have set, as changes to such limits could cause our members to be dissatisfied with our services and the response to our interactive services to decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Furthermore, if our members generally become less responsive to participating in our services, the value of these interactive services will likely decline.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	This could cause our revenue to remain flat or to decline.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Finally, if there is a reduction in the number of network members or their participation in our services, certain anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Epocrates, such as increased name recognition and reputation, cross-sell potential, and the market acceptance of joint services may not be fully realized, if at all.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The market for Internet-based medical business services may not develop substantially further or develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	While Internet-based medical business services have become more accepted, the market for these services remains narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand business services in general, and for their revenue, clinical, and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to an on-demand application service.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S10	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Changes in the health care industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S12	As the health care industry evolves, changes in our member, client, and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S13	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of health care providers within hospital systems may cause our existing practice client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S14	Such larger health care organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S15	Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S16	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S17	General reductions in expenditures by health care companies, or reductions in such expenditures within market segments that we serve, could have similar impacts with regard to our interactive services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S18	Such reductions may result from, among other things, reduced governmental funding for health care; a decrease in the number of, or the market exclusivity available to, new drugs coming to market; government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which health care providers interact with patients, pharmaceutical companies, payers, or other health care industry participants ( e.g. , limitations on advertising to physicians or required disclosure of payments made to them); or adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting health care payers or providers, the pharmaceutical industry, or other health care companies that subscribe for our interactive services ( e.g. , changes in the design of health plans).
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S19	Any of these changes could reduce the purchase of our services by such interactive services clients, reducing our revenue and possibly requiring us to materially revise our offerings.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S20	In addition, our interactive services clients expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to services of the types we provide.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S21	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to clients and users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S22	Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client and user requirements, and sustain market acceptance.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S23	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients or users.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S24	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients and users will want, while offering these services at competitive prices.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P9_S25	For example, our mobile clinical information services are not compatible with all mobile platforms.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	and acceptance in the medical community, or if Internet resources or other non-mobile device resources become more attractive than what is offered for mobile platforms, we may be unable to retain or attract members to our products or services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may lose clients and users.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients and users, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have been experiencing a period of rapid growth.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	To manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; reduce client or user satisfaction; limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources and management attention from other projects, such as the development of new or enhanced services or the acquisition of suitable businesses or technologies.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect these rights.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Our attempts to protect our intellectual property through copyright, patent, and trademark registration may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S10	While we have eleven issued U.S. patents (seven applicable to our Epocrates services), two issued foreign patents (both applicable to our Epocrates services), and a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending as of December 31, 2013 , the scope of issued patents may be insufficient to prevent competitors from providing products and services similar to ours, our patents may be successfully challenged, and we may not be able to obtain additional meaningful patent protection in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Our agreements with clients and users and with certain vendors and strategic partners limit their use of, and retain our rights in, our intellectual property and proprietary information and grant us ownership of intellectual property created in the performance of those agreements to the extent that it relates to the provision of our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S12	In addition, we require certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition, and assignment of inventions agreements and certain of our vendors and strategic partners to agree to contract provisions regarding confidentiality and non-competition.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S13	However, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Further, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in preventing the unauthorized access to, or use of, our proprietary information or the reverse engineering of our technology.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P11_S15	In any event, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technology or authoring clinical information that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or the information we distribute.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In addition, our platforms incorporate open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	While we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	For example, some open source licenses require that those using the associated code disclose modifications made to that code and that such modifications be licensed to third parties at no cost.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use, and we could lose the right to use third-party technologies that are the subject of such claims.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients and third-party service providers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Although many of our third-party service providers are obligated to indemnify us if their products infringe the rights of others, such indemnification may not be effective or adequate to protect us or the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S8	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology or information to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services; or that we would not need to change our product and design plans, which could require us to redesign affected products or services or delay new offerings.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S12	Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including government agencies, patients of our physician clients, or stockholders.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S13	For example, in May 2013 we purchased the property on which our corporate headquarters are located.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S14	This property is a former Superfund site, and our ownership of it, or any of our other properties, could expose us to liability under applicable environmental laws, as well as to liability as a landlord or as owner of property that may be used by members of the public.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S15	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S16	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P18_S17	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS We depend upon third-party service providers for important processing functions.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If these third-party providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	pines to support our client service operations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Among other things, these providers process critical claims data and clinical documents.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If such services fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation, and operating results could be harmed.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Failure of these service providers to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves, which increases our risk.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources, and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We conduct operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, unfavorable intellectual property protection, and pandemics.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, practice client and user satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain practice clients, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, although the substantial majority of the members of our Epocrates network are located in the United States, we currently have members in numerous other countries, and we could expand our international offerings in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Having members who are foreign residents could subject us to additional risks of conducting business, including failure to comply with local consumer protection laws or regulations, the impact of a country s or region s political or economic conditions on purchasing decisions, exposure to competitors who are more familiar with local markets, and restrictions on repatriation of earnings.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Furthermore, we have limited experience in marketing, selling, and supporting our services abroad.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S9	For example, while Symbian is the most widely used mobile operating system in Europe, our clinical information and interactive services are not compatible with Symbian-based devices.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S10	If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S12	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S14	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S15	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S16	For example, Epocrates has experienced high turnover in recent years, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fill all open positions on a timely basis, or at all, on acceptable terms or that the limited exposure to Epocrates business of those hired will not hinder our ability to manage and grow that business effectively, regardless of the extent of their past professional experience.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S17	In addition, our search for replacements for departed employees may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, impact employee hiring and retention, and adversely impact our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S18	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P21_S19	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Volatility in the price of our stock or failure to obtain stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under our equity plans may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Furthermore, the requirements to expense equity awards may discourage us from granting the size or type of equity awards that job candidates require to join our company.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If we acquire companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer-than-expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If the revenue of our practice clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Under most of our practice client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our practice clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S6	With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government health care programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid or initiatives under the Affordable Care Act, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our practice clients receive.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Also, although we currently estimate our expected customer life for practice clients to be twelve years, this is only an estimate, and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Our practice clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated on 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S9	The majority of our clinical information subscriptions have terms of one year, and our contracts with our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients for our interactive services typically range from one to three years.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S10	We cannot assure you that members of our Epocrates network and other Epocrates clients will continue to participate in our existing programs beyond the terms of their existing contracts or that they will enter into any additional contracts for new programs that we offer.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S11	If our practice clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S12	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S13	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P26_S14	A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete with software vendors subject to sales and use taxes, and otherwise harm our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe that our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, we voluntarily approach state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the states in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of, taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles for our athenahealth services, and the uncertainty as to the timing of the fulfillment of our Epocrates services, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The sales cycle for our athenahealth services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution, although this period can be substantially longer.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation, although some of our new-client set-up projects especially those for larger practice clients are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated expected customer life, currently twelve years, or the contract term.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Even if implementation has begun, there can be no assurance that we will recognize revenue on a timely basis or at all from our efforts.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Implementation for a given practice client may be canceled, as our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or no reason on 90 days notice.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Despite the fact that we typically require a deposit in advance of implementation, some clients have canceled before our services have been started.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	In addition, implementation may be delayed, or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future, for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	If implementation periods are extended, our provision of the revenue cycle, clinical cycle, or patient cycle services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S6	In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the canceled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S7	In regard to our Epocrates services, the time between the date of the signing of the contract with a pharmaceutical client for a program, the actual fulfillment of the services under such contract and the revenue recognition associated with such revenues may be lengthy, especially for larger contracts with multiple deliverables, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including those that result from that client s need for internal approvals.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S8	These factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S9	As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Because we recognize revenue from our drug and clinical reference tool subscriptions and certain of our interactive services over the term or at the end of the service period, a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results, which may make it more difficult to evaluate our prospects.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S11	We recognize revenue from our Epocrates subscription agreements monthly over the terms of these agreements, which are typically one year.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S12	In most cases, we recognize revenue from our interactive services over the terms of these agreements or upon delivery of each service element.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S13	As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from subscription and service agreements entered into during prior periods.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S14	Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions or service agreements in any one quarter may not materially affect our financial performance in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S15	In addition, we may be unable to adjust our costs, many of which are fixed, in response to reduced revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P31_S16	Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our services may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make our reported results less indicative of our future prospects.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If we fail to meet our current credit agreement s financial covenants, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We currently have a credit agreement which contains financial covenants, including maintaining a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio, and a consolidated senior leverage ratio.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we borrowed $223.8 million under the agreement and were in compliance with its financial covenants.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	There is no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with all of the covenants under the agreement, and, if at any point we fail to comply with the financial covenants, the lenders can demand immediate repayment of our outstanding balance and deny future borrowings under the agreement.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	This could have a negative impact on our liquidity, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes and adversely affecting our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	RISKS RELATED TO OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our applications from operating properly.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If our systems do not function reliably or fail to achieve user or client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us, and members could choose to terminate their use of our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients and members.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Errors may result from sources beyond our control, including the receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information; interface of our services with legacy systems that we did not develop; or errors in data provided by third parties.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S7	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our practice clients or members may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Therefore, despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes following introduction to the market.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S9	For example, changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, so we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S10	Because practice clients rely on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data-including information to assist care providers in tracking and treating ill patients-and members rely on our services to provide timely and accurate information regarding medical conditions and medicines, they may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S11	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby give rise to a product liability claim or errors or omissions claim.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S12	Such claims could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of those claims.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P33_S13	While our subscription and services agreements typically contain limitations of liability and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software or content, such limitations and disclaimers may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from related claims.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In light of this, defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share; liability to clients, members, their patients, or others; failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion; diversion of development and management resources; delays in the introduction of new services; injury to our reputation; and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients or members from purchasing services from us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If our security measures are breached or fail, and unauthorized access is obtained to a client s or member s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients and members may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our services involve the web-based storage and transmission of clients and members proprietary information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce customer confidence and require substantial resources to address.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client, member, or patient data.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P36_S4	As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We rely upon users of our systems for key activities to promote security of those systems and the data within them, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	On occasion, our users have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Failure of users to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales, clients, and members.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S5	In addition, our practice clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their patients on our systems.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S8	We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S9	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S10	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S11	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S12	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S13	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S14	Various events could interrupt users access to our systems, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S15	The ability to access our systems is critical to our practice clients administration of care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S16	Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) terrorism and acts of war; (iv) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our systems or those of others; and (v) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our systems or those of others.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S17	We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S18	If users access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by practice clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to those clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S19	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely in part upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S20	Although we carry business interruption insurance, it only covers some, but not all, of these potential events, and even for those events that are covered, it may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events, including, for example, loss of market share and diminution of our brand, reputation, and member and client loyalty.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S21	In addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S22	Some laws impose obligations on our practice clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P37_S23	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users or clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we currently serve our practice clients from three third-party data-hosting facilities located in the greater Boston, Massachusetts, and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, areas.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These facilities are operated by Colospace Inc. and two subsidiaries of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, in December 2009 we signed a contract with a major provider of disaster recovery services, SunGard Availability Services, LP, to store our disaster recovery plans and provide disaster recovery testing services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In the case of a significant event at any of these data centers, we could move operations from that data center to our other data centers within a reasonable timeframe.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	For our Epocrates services, in addition to our operations at our facility in San Mateo, California, we use a co-location service administered by AT T, Inc. in Redwood City, California.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	However, these facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	For example, the proximity of our San Mateo and Redwood City, California, operations, which are the sole facilities used to provide our Epocrates services, could result in both facilities being impacted by a regional event, such as an earthquake.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Our ability to deliver our Internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P39_S7	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable mobile device, telephone, facsimile, and pager systems.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments and meet user expectations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	However, we have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment or service providers, to provide our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users or clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and clients, adversely affect our brands and business, and expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients and members, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including database software from Oracle Corporation and storage devices from International Business Machines Corporation and EMC Corporation.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms; however, it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients and members, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	While we have implemented certain features and safeguards designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, members, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our software, content, and services are used to assist clinical decision-making and provide information about patient medical histories, treatment plans, medical conditions, and the use of particular medications.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, members, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our athenaClinicals service is utilized in clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Therefore, if these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us by practice clients, clinicians, patients, or others.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Although the data stored and displayed in athenaClinicals is generally provided by our practice clients or third parties, and we often have little control over their accuracy, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of health care services or erroneous health information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our Epocrates clinical reference tools and interactive services provide health care professionals with access to clinical information, including information regarding particular medical conditions and the use of particular medications.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, or we introduce inaccuracies in the process of implementing third-party content, it is possible that patients, physicians, consumers, the providers of the third-party content, or others may sue us if they are harmed as a result of such inaccuracies.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control of the information that we publish or provide.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	However, we cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content, and we have had content errors in the past.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages; have our members assume responsibility for medical oversight and dosing decisions; and require that our practice clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Furthermore, while we maintain general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S6	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S7	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P47_S8	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION Government regulation of health care creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the health care industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Many health care laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In particular, many existing health care laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the health care information and interactive services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate, particularly as we develop and release new and more sophisticated products and services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Some of the risks we face from health care regulation are described below: False or Fraudulent Claim Laws .
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse in connection with such submission and payment.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our practice client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving practice clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our practice clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S6	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S7	The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to engage in or overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S8	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P51_S10	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our practice clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to those clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations .
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity subject to HIPAA.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In addition, our practice clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	access by the Department of Health and Human Services to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it (including the omnibus rule promulgated in January 2013) have provided clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, ONCHIT is coordinating the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the health care sector.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S5	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S6	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, and their interpretations are no less stringent than ours, we seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our practice clients, and since we do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of those clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Among our services, we provide telephone reminder services to patients, Internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	We believe that reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure of individually identifiable health information have been and are being taken in connection with these services, including the use of multiple-password security.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	However, any failure of our practice clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and other personally identifiable information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In addition to false claims and HIPAA requirements, we are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to health care providers and patients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	For example, the federal health care programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal health care program.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws forbid bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients, vendors, or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	For example, one aspect of our athenaCoordinator service is the preparation and submission of electronic orders from providers to other participants in the health care system ( e.g. , hospitals, labs, and specialists).
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	accurate, complete, and readable orders instead of the handwritten and often incomplete orders traditionally submitted, our service could potentially be seen as providing referrals to the order recipients in exchange for payment.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Although the Office of Inspector General issued an Advisory Opinion in November 2011 stating that our receipt of payments in such instances would not violate federal anti-kickback laws, we cannot predict whether changes in the law or our services might lead to a challenge of the legality of those services by government regulators.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Legislation relating to payments to physicians .
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Legislation enacted or pending in several states and enacted at the federal level as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 mandates public disclosure of, or otherwise regulates or limits the providing of, certain gifts and payments by pharmaceutical companies to physicians.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	These laws may be interpreted to cover honorarium payments made to physicians for participation in market research activities sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Because we currently provide market research services involving participants from our member network, the increased adoption and enforcement of these laws and the application of any public disclosure requirements or other limitations may have a negative impact on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to sponsor these activities or the willingness of physicians to participate in the market research.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P61_S4	To date, we have not experienced a significant reduction in our market research services business as a result of these laws in the few jurisdictions in which they have been enacted and become effective.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P61_S5	However, we cannot predict how pharmaceutical companies or physicians will respond when such legislation becomes more widespread or becomes effective at the federal level.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P61_S6	A significant decline in the sponsorship of our market research services by pharmaceutical companies or the agencies that represent such companies, or a significant decline in physicians willingness to participate in such studies could negatively impact our operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	There are federal and state laws that forbid payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with health care providers.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal laws called the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practice clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P62_S4	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws .
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our practice clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our practice clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our service fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Any determination that we or our practice clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	As a company that provides EHR functionality, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our practice clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P68_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The software component of our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2014 Edition compliant Complete EHR by CCHIT, an ONC-ATCB, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	While we believe that our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of medical practice claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Although we do not determine what is billed to a payer, to the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our practice clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for health care services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and time frames may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by practice clients.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The practice of most health care professions requires licensing under applicable state law.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities from practicing medicine.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P74_S2	We do not believe that we engage in the practice of medicine and have attempted to structure our services, strategic relationships, and other operations to avoid violating these state licensing and professional practice laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P74_S3	We employ and contract with physicians who provide only medical information to our users, some of whom may be consumers, and we do not intend to provide medical care or advice.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Any determination that we are a health care provider and acted improperly as a health care provider may result in liability to us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Regulation of drug and medical device advertising and promotion .
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	We provide services involving promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Any increase in regulation of these areas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA; the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC; or other governmental bodies at the federal, state, or local level, could make it more difficult for us to contract for certain of our interactive services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Physician groups and others have criticized the FDA s current policies and have called for restrictions on advertising of prescription drugs and for increased FDA enforcement.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	In response, the FDA has conducted hearings and sought public comment regarding its regulation of information concerning drugs on the Internet and the relationships between pharmaceutical companies and those disseminating information on drugs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We cannot predict what actions the FDA or industry participants may take in response to these criticisms.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P76_S3	It is also possible that new laws would be enacted that impose restrictions on such marketing and advertising.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P76_S4	Our interactive services revenues could be materially reduced by additional restrictions on the marketing or advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices, whether imposed by law or regulation or by policies adopted by industry members.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	If the FDA, the FTC, or another governmental body finds that any information available on our website or distributed by us violates FDA, FTC, or other laws or regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state s consumer protection statutes or other new or existing laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In addition, in February 2011 the FDA issued a final rule regarding regulation of Medical Device Data Systems (MDDSs), which are systems that are intended to transfer, store, convert, or display medical device data.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	While EHRs are expressly exempted from the final rule, it is possible that future changes in our services could involve the transfer, storage, conversion, or display of medical device data.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	we anticipate by mid-2014 from the FDA, ONCHIT, and the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to propose a regulatory framework for health information technology for the purpose of promoting innovation, protecting patient safety, and avoiding regulatory duplication.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	To the extent that our software is considered a medical device under the policy or an MDDS under the final rule, or is the subject of additional regulation promulgated as a result of the report, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Potential health care reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new service types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Our services may be significantly impacted by health care reform initiatives and will be subject to increasing regulatory requirements, either of which could affect our business in a multitude of ways.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S4	If substantive health care reform or applicable regulatory requirements are adopted, we may have to change or adapt our services and software to comply.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S5	Reform or changing regulatory requirements may also render our services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S6	This may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop services or software.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S7	For example, the conversion to the ICD-10 standard in October 2014 for coding medical diagnoses will likely cause significant disruption to our industry and consume a large amount of resources on our part.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S8	Such reforms may also make introduction of new service types more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S9	Such changes may even prevent introduction by us of new services or make the continuation of our existing services unprofitable or impossible.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P81_S10	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and customer service providers, for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Due to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to government regulation unrelated to health care.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	While our services are primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to health care, certain aspects of those services may require us to comply with regulatory schemes from other areas.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Examples of such regulatory schema include: Anti-spam Laws .
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P84_S3	We may be required to comply with current or future anti-spam legislation by limiting or modifying some of our interactive services, such as our clinical messaging, which may result in a reduction in our revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	One such law, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM, became effective in the United States on January 1, 2004.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	CAN-SPAM imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with the sending of commercial e-mail.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	CAN-SPAM or similar laws may impose burdens on our member communication practices and on certain of our services, which in turn could harm our ability to attract new payer and pharmaceutical clients and increase revenues.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Our national cloud-based network allows us access to cost and pricing data for a large number of providers in most regional markets, as well as to the contracted rates for third-party payers.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	To the extent that our services enable providers to compare their cost and pricing data with those of their competitors, those providers could collude to increase the pricing for their services, to reduce the compensation they pay their employees, or to collectively negotiate agreements with third parties.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P86_S4	Similarly, if payers are able to compare their contracted rates of payment to providers, those payers may seek to reduce the amounts they might otherwise pay.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	To the extent that we are deemed to have enabled such activities, we could be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission and be required to curtail or terminate the services that permitted such collusion.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	As a billing service that offers patient communication and registration services, our employees or those of our service providers may from time to time come into contact with patients who owe our practice clients outstanding amounts.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Communications with patients that relate to amounts owed may be deemed to subject us or our service providers to federal or state debt collection laws and regulations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Such laws and regulations, if deemed to apply to us, could require registration with government agencies and compliance with significant administrative obligations ( e.g. , to maintain an in-state office with local employees), which could result in increased expenses and subject us to fines and penalties for violation.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Following the disclosure in 2012 of the methods used by debt collector Accretive Health to obtain payment of amounts owed by patients to one of its hospital clients, heightened focus on debt collection practices may lead to additional regulation and greater scrutiny of existing debt collection practices.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use, and dissemination of data, and the presentation of website or other electronic content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security, and access.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Courts may also adopt these developing standards.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	A number of states, including California, have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the release of credit card or other personal information received from consumers.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S1	In addition, several foreign governments have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S2	For example, the European Union, or EU, adopted the Data Protection Directive, or DPD, imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information online.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S3	The DPD provides for specific regulations requiring all non-EU countries doing business with EU member states to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Similarly, Canada s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S5	Foreign governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities, and our practice management services for practices along the Canadian border and our market research services could each involve the personal information of foreign residents.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S6	Furthermore, in the conduct of our market research activities outside of the United States, we rely upon a third party to identify and recruit respondents for the market research and to comply with the applicable privacy laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S7	We cannot assure you that this third party will successfully comply with such laws or that we would not be responsible for any failure of this third party to comply.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S8	While we have privacy policies posted with our services that we believe comply with applicable laws requiring notice to our users and practice clients about our information collection, use, and disclosure practices, we cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S9	Whether and how existing local and international privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the Internet and other online technologies is still uncertain and may take years to resolve.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S10	Privacy laws and regulations, if drafted or interpreted broadly, could be deemed to apply to the technology we use and could restrict our information collection methods or decrease the amount and utility of the information that we would be permitted to collect.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S11	The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or services, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S12	In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices, or those of our agents, do not meet these standards could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S13	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S14	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S15	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S16	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P90_S17	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	In each of these cases, we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S3	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided, as well as the channel relationships themselves, may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Any misconduct by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients, any failure to follow contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S6	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S7	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and lead analysts or investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, resulting in reduction in the market price of our stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S8	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S9	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S10	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S11	If any of our employees or subcontractors takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S12	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S13	Subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand if we do not participate in such programs.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S14	In the past few years, various entities and federal programs have provided subsidies for services similar to ours, including EHR initiatives.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S15	While we have qualified for and participated in many of such subsidy programs, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S16	To the extent that we do not participate in such programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S17	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S18	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P93_S19	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	If a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S3	If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , we had approximately 37.3 million shares of common stock outstanding, with a large percentage held by a few institutional shareholders.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S5	Moreover, certain holders of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S6	We have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our 1997 Stock Plan, 2000 Stock Plan, 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and we have assumed the 1999 Stock Option Plan, 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan of Epocrates, under which all issuable common stock has been registered.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S7	As of December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding options to purchase approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock (approximately 1.4 million of which were exercisable at December 31, 2013 ) that, if exercised, would result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S8	As of December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding restricted stock units totaling approximately 1.2 million that, if vested, would result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S9	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P94_S10	Actual or potential sales of our stock by our employees, including members of our senior management team, pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons, and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	In accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and our policies regarding stock transactions, a number of our directors and employees, including members of our senior management team, have adopted and will continue to adopt pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell shares of our common stock that they hold or will hold as the result of exercise or vesting of equity grants.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Generally, stock sales under such plans by members of our senior management team and directors require public filings.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Actual or potential sales of our stock by such persons could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P95_S3	For example, actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P95_S4	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P95_S5	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P95_S6	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	the ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our by-laws.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally an entity that, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, stockholders ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P98_S3	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P98_S4	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P98_S5	Therefore, investors are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_14_ITEM1A_P98_S6	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.
1131096_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our primary location is 311 Arsenal Street in Watertown, Massachusetts.
1131096_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , we owned the building housing our headquarters as part of our purchase of the real estate commonly known as the Arsenal on the Charles, located in Watertown, Massachusetts in May 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Arsenal on the Charles is an expansive 29 -acre, multi-building, commercial property which includes approximately 762,000 square feet of office space, where we were leasing space for our headquarters and related operating activities prior to the transaction.

1131096_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	On July 18, 2011, we filed a complaint against ADP AdvancedMD, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaint alleges that ADP AdvancedMD, Inc. has infringed two of our U.S. Patents: No. 7,617,116, which was issued on November 10, 2009, for Practice Management and Billing Automation System and No. 7,720,701, which was issued on May 18, 2010, for Automated Configuration of Medical Practice Management Systems.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	On May 16, 2012, the Court entered the parties joint stipulation of dismissal without prejudice of claims and counterclaims related to U.S. Patent No. 7,720,701.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	A Markman Hearing was held on September 14, 2012, and a ruling was issued on November 26, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P0_S4	We are seeking permanent injunctive relief, damages, pre- and post-judgment costs and interest, and attorneys fees.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	On July 28, 2011, a complaint was filed by PPS Data, LLC naming us in a patent infringement case (PPS Data, LLC v. athenahealth, Inc., Civil Action No. 3:11-cv-00746, United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida).
1131096_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint alleges that we have infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,343,271 with a listed issue date of January 29, 2002, entitled Electronic Creation, Submission, Adjudication, and Payment of Health Insurance Claims (the 271 Patent ).
1131096_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	The complaint seeks an injunction enjoining infringement, damages, pre- and post-judgment costs and interest, and attorneys fees.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	On September 8, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	No. 6,341,265 with a listed issue date of January 22, 2002, entitled Provider claim editing and settlement system, and U.S. Patent No. 7,194,416 with a listed issue date of March 20, 2007, entitled Interactive creation and adjudication of health care insurance claims.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	The Court granted the plaintiff s motion for leave to amend its complaint on December 21, 2011, and on December 23, 2011, the plaintiff filed its amended complaint.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P3_S2	On December 27, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the 271 Patent.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P3_S3	On December 29, 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted our request for reexamination of the 271 Patent.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P3_S4	On January 9, 2012, we filed a motion to stay the case pending completion of the patent reexamination, and on March 1, 2012, the Court granted our motion to stay the case.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P3_S5	We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the amended complaint and will continue to contest the claims vigorously.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	On January 11, 2013, a complaint captioned Bushansky v. Epocrates, Inc., et al., Case No. 519078, was filed in San Mateo County Superior Court (the Court ) on behalf of a putative class of Epocrates shareholders against Epocrates and each member of the Epocrates board of directors.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	This complaint challenged the proposed merger between Epocrates and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S2	This second complaint made similar allegations against Epocrates and each member of the Epocrates board of directors and included a claim against us for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S3	On January 31, 2013, the Bushansky complaint was amended to include additional allegations.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S4	Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Epocrates directors breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly agreeing to sell Epocrates at an unfair and inadequate price, failing to take steps to maximize the sale price of Epocrates, and making material omissions to the preliminary proxy statement dated January 25, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S5	The complaints sought to enjoin the merger, other equitable relief, and monetary damages.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S6	On March 5, 2013, Epocrates and the plaintiffs signed a memorandum of understanding in which the parties agreed to enter into a stipulation of settlement whereby the plaintiffs and all class members would release all claims related to the merger in exchange for Epocrates filing a supplement to its definitive proxy statement regarding the merger with the SEC, which would include additional disclosures regarding the merger agreement, and an agreement to negotiate in good faith regarding the amount of attorneys fees and expenses for which plaintiffs may seek approval from the Court.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S7	On October 4, 2013, the court granted final settlement approval including a grant of fees and expenses in the amount of $335,000 to plaintiffs counsel.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P4_S8	The settlement has no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	On March 1, 2013, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California captioned Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit v. Epocrates, Inc. et al., Case No. 5:13cv0945, on behalf of a putative class of Epocrates stockholders against Epocrates and certain of its former officers and directors.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S1	The complaint asserts claims under sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased Epocrates stock in its Initial Public Offering and claims under sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased shares between the February 2, 2011, IPO and August 9, 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S2	The complaint alleges that Epocrates made false or misleading statements with respect to the fact that Epocrates pharmaceutical clients were awaiting guidance from the Food and Drug Administration on the use of advertising and social media, which caused the clients to delay spending on marketing and negatively impacted Epocrates sales and revenue growth.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S3	The complaint seeks certification as a class action, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, plaintiff s costs, attorneys fees, and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S4	On December 9, 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S5	We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the complaint and will continue to contest the claims vigorously.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S6	In addition, from time to time we may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1131096_14_ITEM3_P5_S7	We do not, however, currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ATHN.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 5, 2014, was $141.51 per share.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 5, 2014, we had 90 holders of record of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	Dividends We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P1_S4	We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P1_S5	Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Performance Graph The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Set forth below is a graph comparing the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the NASDAQ Composite-Total Returns Index and the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 , assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None.
1131096_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the quarter ended December 31, 2013 , there were no purchases made by us, on our behalf, or by any affiliated purchasers of shares of our common stock.
1131096_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables summarize our consolidated financial data for the periods presented.
1131096_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	You should read the following financial information together with the information under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to these consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods.
1131096_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , $2.2 million and $0.8 million of stock-based compensation was capitalized in the software development costs line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for which $1.0 million and $0.3 million was included in the depreciation and amortization expense line in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	The amount of stock-based compensation related to capitalized software development costs in prior periods was not significant.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes to these financial statements, and the other financial information that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue the negative of these terms; or other comparable terminology.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Except as required by law, we are under no duty to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview athenahealth provides cloud-based business services that help medical caregivers achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more revenue and greatly reducing their administrative work burden.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	These services are designed to minimize the hassles that caregivers and their staff face from complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many related tasks that can take attention away from delivering care.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud-based platform, athenaNet.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	We differentiate our services by continuously updating and improving our services via athenaNet.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Regular updates to athenaNet are free and automatic for everyone on the network.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	As a web-based platform, athenaNet can be quickly implemented by our staff, with low upfront costs to clients.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	The services provided through our single-instance cloud are offered as a suite of four seamlessly integrated services: athenaCollector for revenue cycle and practice management, athenaClinicals for electronic health record management, athenaCommunicator for automated, live and online patient communications, and athenaCoordinator for referral cycle management.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Beginning in 2014, athenaCoordinator includes our financial and operations management and our population health management services.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	These services are the result of the integration of Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. (business intelligence tools) and Healthcare Data Services LLC (patient population health management) acquisitions.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct but interconnected components: cloud-based software ( Software ), networked knowledge ( Knowledge ), and back-office work ( Work ).
1131096_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The cloud-based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients, insurance payers, and our staff of experts.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Knowledge is infused into each of our services via our Rules Engine as we work with clients, insurance payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance, making the network smarter and more powerful for all clients.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	The network s shared knowledge and transparency also allows clients to monitor and benchmark their performance against those of other practices across the network.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The third component to each of our services is the Work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Wherever possible, we replace manual processes with automation, but where automation is not possible, we perform the work on our clients behalf.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	These services range from receiving, scanning, and delivering incoming faxes to tracking claims with insurance payers.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	This unique service model of Software, Knowledge, and Work is the core of our aligned success model.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	We charge clients a percentage of collections, in most cases, connecting our financial results directly to that of our clients and our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	We also provide clients in the health care industry ( e.g. , pharmaceutical companies, managed care companies, and market research firms) the opportunity to sponsor clinical information and decision support services in order to engage with Epocrates member network, and offer the sale of subscriptions to Epocrates premium drug and clinical reference tools to health care professionals.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , we generated revenue of $595.0 million from the sale of our services compared to $422.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , and $324.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P6_S8	Our revenue is predominately derived from core athenahealth business services that we provide on an ongoing basis.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	To provide these services, we incur expenses in several categories, including direct operating, selling and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	In general, our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our intended growth rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future, our overall business management activities, and our infrastructure.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity and to ensure adherence to related financial covenants.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ).
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S6	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S7	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P7_S8	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including our estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock options; (5) allocation of direct and indirect expenses; (6) fair value of acquired intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets in a business combination; (7) fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment test; and (8) litigation reserves.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Please refer to the tables below for those estimates and assumptions which we deem to be the most critical.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained, and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Actual results could differ from the estimates we have used.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, as they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	All revenue, other than implementation revenue, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the client, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	We derive our revenue from business services associated with our four integrated services and from subscriptions to and sponsored clinical information and decision support services for our point of care medical application.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year service contracts related to our integrated services that renew automatically upon completion.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to our cloud-based network, athenaNet; minimum fees; flat fees; or per-claim fees where applicable.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the subsequent month and delivered to clients primarily by e-mail.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	For most of our clients, amounts due are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Subscriptions for the Epocrates point of care medical application are entered into by a member via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable license code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Basic subscriptions are free and do not expire.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Premium subscription fees are assessed on the length of the subscription period, typically one year, and payment occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed, and are recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Premium subscriptions are recognized ratably over the Determining whether and when some of our revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied often involves judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	For example, our assessment of the likelihood of collection is a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	If we do not believe that collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Multiple element arrangements require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	We maintain a standard price list by service; however, certain incentives, such as discounts, may be offered to clients when they purchase multiple services.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Such discounting is subject to various levels of management approval and any discount offered is based on the total contract value.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Due to the specific nature of these agreements and the variability in the amount of discount offered for individual services across multiple contracts, we have not been able to conclude that a consistent number of standalone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established VSOE.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	When we cannot establish VSOE of fair value, we then determine if we can establish TPE of fair value.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our services differ significantly from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Therefore, we are typically unable to determine TPE.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	If both VSOE and TPE do not exist, we use BESP to establish fair value and to allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our calculation of BESP may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	For example, if our BESP is too high or too low for an individual or group of deliverables, the amount of revenue recognized within each reporting period would be inaccurate.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	The amount of deferred revenue related to separable deliverables with BESP is $22.4 million as of December 31, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our estimate of expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	For example, if, in the future, we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	On the other hand, if, in the future, we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	The amount of deferred revenue related to non-refundable up-front fees is $41.3 million as of December 31, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Description Judgment and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions contracted term of delivery, typically a year.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	If a license code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Clients in the health care industry typically enter into sponsored clinical information and decision support service arrangements that contain various combinations of services that are generally fulfilled within one year.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The clients are charged a fee for the entire group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Because billings typically occur in advance of services being performed, these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when billed.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit and consideration is allocated using our best estimate of selling price ( BESP ) if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price ( VSOE ) of fair value or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of fair value.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Any discount or premium inherent in the arrangement is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that product, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, and pricing practices.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Multiple element arrangements require judgment as to whether deliverables meet the criteria to be separated into separate units of accounting.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the client.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	We believe that our implementation service related to our integrated services is not separable from the ongoing business services, as the implementation services do not have value to the customer on a standalone basis.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	We determined the estimated customer life considering the following key factors: - Renewal rate considerations - Economic life of the product or service - Industry data The estimated customer life, or expected performance period, for the years presented is 12 years.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Business Combinations, including purchased intangible assets are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Measurement period adjustments relate to adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information that we should have known at the time of acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	All changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant s viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually on November 30th or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Fair value accounting as it relates to business combinations and impairment testing requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets and the fair value of reporting units during goodwill impairment tests include, but are not limited to, identifying reporting units, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers, expected future cash outflows, the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and a probability-weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Significant judgment in testing goodwill for impairment also includes assigning assets and liabilities to those reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit based on management s best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Management s best estimates and assumptions are employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets, which are finite-lived assets.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangibles were $198.0 million and $168.4 million, respectively.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	We derive our revenue from two sources: from business services associated with our revenue cycle and practice management service, electronic health record management service, patient communication management service, care coordination management service, financial and population analytics offerings, and from subscriptions to and sponsored clinical information and decision support services for our point of care clinical application; and from implementation and other services.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Implementation and other services revenue consists primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services, for ongoing training and related support services, and for third-party tenant revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Business services accounted for approximately 95% and 97% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Business services revenue is typically 2% to 8% of a practice s total collections depending upon the services purchased, the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice, plus a per-statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	Accordingly, business services revenue is largely driven by: the number of physician practices and other service providers we serve, the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians, the mix of our services used by those physician practices and other medical providers, and our contracted rates.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Additionally, the volume of activity and related collections vary from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the flu season.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	While we believe that the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season will continue to impact collections by our physician clients, there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	Implementation and other services revenue is largely driven by the increase in the volume of our new business.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	As a result, we expect implementation and other services revenue to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P44_S6	None of our clients accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits, claim processing costs, stock-based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients, including staff who implement new clients, and other direct expenses.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	We include in direct operating expense all service costs incurred to fulfill our revenue contracts.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	We expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation, with higher volumes of work in particular functions, geographies, and medical specialties.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	Although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future, the direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenue as we increase automation.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Direct operating expense includes costs associated with third-party tenant revenue for the Arsenal on the Charles.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent expense, depreciation, and amortization, except for a portion of amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and on-line initiatives) and personnel-related expense for sales and marketing employees (including salaries, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expenses).
1131096_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	We have increased our sales and marketing expenses from year to year and we expect to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel and support personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients and to expand awareness through paid search and other similar initiatives.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	We also plan to expand our marketing activities, such as attending trade shows, expanding user groups, and creating new printed materials.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P47_S5	As a result, we expect that, in the near-term, sales and marketing expense will increase in line with revenue growth.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Sales and marketing expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), depreciation, and amortization, except for a portion of amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses for research and development employees (including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, non-billable travel, lodging, and other out-of-pocket employee-related expenses) and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	We expect that, in the near-term, research and development expenditures will increase in absolute terms and will likely increase as a percent of revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services; however, the amount of expenditures that should be capitalized as software development costs versus expensed as research and development could vary based on the specific projects we undertake.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	out-of-pocket employee-related expense), occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities for space occupied by the Company), and insurance premiums; and, outside professional fees for accountants, lawyers, external costs associated with acquisitions, change in the fair value of contingent consideration, and consultants.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development and acquisition costs, which we amortize over a two to three-year period from the time of release of related software code.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	As we grow, we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	In the near term we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase as a percentage of total revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Other income (expense) is primarily comprised of interest expense.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our term and revolving loans under our credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing fees.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Income tax (provision) benefit consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and India.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	The difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory rate is mainly related to transaction costs associated with stock acquisitions, any changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to non-tax deductible goodwill, the treatment of Incentive Stock Options ( ISOs ), and the impact of certain tax deduction limits related to certain of our highly compensated officers.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Transaction costs related to stock acquisitions are primarily non-tax deductible.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	The changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to non-tax deductible goodwill and the treatment of disqualifying dispositions related to ISOs are also treated as discrete items, which means that they are recorded in the quarter in which they occur and could cause significant differences between the quarterly and annual effective tax rate.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	We substantially ceased issuing ISOs in 2009, but we expect continued volatility related to these options since we cannot anticipate when disqualifying dispositions related to these stock options will occur.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012, and 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Percentages for each line item may not sum to the totals or subtotals for each fiscal year due to rounding.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 41% due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase in business services revenue is primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services, and additionally due to revenue from sponsored clinical information and decision support services and subscriptions.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	The increases in the number of physicians and providers using our revenue cycle and practice management service, athenaCollector; electronic health record management service, athenaClinicals; and patient communication management service, athenaCommunicator; are as follows:
1131096_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The amount of collections processed are as follows:
1131096_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	The year ended December 31, 2013 includes $52.4 million of total revenue attributable to sponsored clinical information and decision support services and subscriptions.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The increase in revenue from implementation and other revenue was primarily driven by third-party tenant revenue of $9.7 million associated with the Arsenal on the Charles property from the date of acquisition in May through December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Implementation and other revenue was also increased by new client implementations and increased professional services for our larger client base.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients increased during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The increase in direct operating expense is primarily due to the expense of providing these services, including transactions expense and employee-related costs.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Direct operating employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, increased $28.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 , to the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to a 12% increase in headcount since December 31, 2012 , and an increase in fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	We increased headcount to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base continues to expand and includes larger medical groups.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	Headcount at December 31, 2013 includes 57 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	Also contributing to the increase in direct operating expense was amortization related to purchased intangible assets, which increased $8.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 , to the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to our acquisitions of Epocrates during the three months ended March 31, 2013, and the Arsenal on the Charles during the three months ended June 30, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	Direct operating expense from the Arsenal on the Charles acquisition date of May 10, 2013, through the period ended December 31, 2013 , includes $4.7 million of costs associated with third-party tenant revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P61_S5	No cost associated with third-party tenant revenue was included in direct operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, internal sales commissions and external channel partner commission, which increased approximately $26.6 million, or 40%, from $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , to $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The cost of compensation is primarily driven by headcount.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Our sales and marketing headcount increased 34% since December 31, 2012 , as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	Headcount at December 31, 2013 also includes 59 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S3	Also contributing to the increase in selling and marketing expense was a $9.0 million increase in other general marketing-related costs.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S4	Finally, amortization related to purchased intangible assets allocated to selling and marketing expense increased $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to our acquisition of Epocrates during the three months ended March 31, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S5	The increase in research and development expense was due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased approximately $23.8 million , or 70%, from $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , to $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S6	This increase is primarily due to a 68% increase in headcount from December 31, 2012 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S7	The additional research and development personnel were necessary in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S8	Headcount at December 31, 2013 also includes 97 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P63_S9	We anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	Employee-related compensation increased $21.1 million, largely due to a 28% increase in headcount from December 31, 2012 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	We increased our general and administrative personnel to support our growth.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	General and administrative headcount at December 31, 2013 also includes 29 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Included in the employee-related compensation is an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $7.9 million.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	The stock-based compensation increase for the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily related to acceleration of vesting for certain Epocrates employees upon termination and an increase in the fair value of recently issued stock-based awards due to an increase in the stock price.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The increase we experienced in headcount drove an increased investment in our infrastructure of $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Additionally, transaction costs associated with the Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles acquisitions increased general and administrative expenses by $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	These costs were partially offset by a $2.5 million net gain in the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to the early termination of our lease and the realization of the remaining balance in deferred rent upon acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles property where our corporate headquarters are located in Watertown, Massachusetts.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	Comparatively, in the year ended December 31, 2012 , there was a net fair value adjustment of a $5.1 million credit related to contingent consideration compared to a less than $0.1 million charge in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was $43.6 million , an increase of approximately $17.9 million , or 70%, from depreciation and amortization of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation from fixed asset expenditures in 2013 and 2012, the acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles, and higher amortization related to an increase in our software development costs of $8.9 million, $2.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P66_S6	Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding compared to the prior year.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The change from an income tax provision to an income tax benefit is primarily due to lower pre-tax income and an increase in research and development tax credits, offset by larger permanent items for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Research and development tax credits increased $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	This increase is primarily attributable to completion of a multi-year research and development tax study.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	Additionally, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law reinstating the federal research and development credit for the 2012 and 2013 years.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	Under the accounting guidance on this topic, the effects are recognized as a component of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the financial statements for the period that includes the enactment date.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P67_S5	The benefit related to the 2012 federal research and development credit of $0.9 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P67_S6	The offsetting higher permanent items for the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily due to non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of Epocrates of $2.2 million.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased almost entirely due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The increase in business services revenue is primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The summary of changes in the physicians and providers using our revenue cycle management service, athenaCollector, electronic health record management service, athenaClinicals, and patient communication management service, athenaCommunicator are as follows:
1131096_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The amount of collections processed are as follows:
1131096_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	The increase in revenue from implementation and other revenue was driven by new client implementations and increased professional services for our larger client base.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase in implementation and other revenue is the result of the increase in the volume of our new business.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The increase in direct operating expense is primarily due to an increase in the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients and the related expense of providing services, including transactions expense and employee-related costs.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the direct operating employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, which increased $28.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2011, to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to the 28% increase in headcount since December 31, 2011, and an increase in the fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	We increased headcount to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base has expanded and includes larger medical groups.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Amortization related to purchased intangible assets increased $1.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2011, to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, internal sales commissions and external partner channel commissions of $15.7 million, or 31%, from $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, to $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Our sales and marketing headcount increased by 28% since December 31, 2011, as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	The increase was also due to a $3.4 million increase in travel-related expenses and consulting and a $5.4 million increase in online marketing, offline marketing and other marketing events for the year.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	Research and development expense increased due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense of $8.5 million, or 42%, from $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, to $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	This increase is due in part to a 45% increase in headcount from December 31, 2011, as we hired additional research and development personnel in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S4	The increase was also due to a $1.9 million increase in travel-related expenses, infrastructure and consulting.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S5	General and administrative expense increased partially due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, of $6.2 million, due to an increase in headcount and in the fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S6	Our general and administrative headcount increased by 26% since December 31, 2011, as we added personnel to support our growth.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S7	The increase in headcount drove an increase in our expenditures related to infrastructure by $3.4 million.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S8	General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 included an increase of $2.3 million in legal, audit, tax, consulting, and external costs associated with acquisitions and insurance expenses along with an increase of $2.6 million in travel expenses, recruiting and corporate events.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S9	These increases are offset by a decrease in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $1.0 million due to less accounts requiring higher reserve percentages due to increased collection activity and a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration of $5.1 million.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S10	The fair value considerations related to each of the contingent considerations are fully disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P76_S11	The impact of those described changes in the fair value of the contingent considerations on General and Administrative Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:
1131096_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $25.6 million, an increase of $8.9 million, or 53%, from depreciation and amortization of $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation from fixed asset expenditures in 2012 and 2011 and higher amortization related to an increase in our software development costs.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	The effective tax rate is higher due to larger permanent items for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily related to compensation in excess of tax deduction limits which had a 1.5% unfavorable impact, the change in the Anodyne contingent consideration which is treated as additional non-taxable goodwill which had a 1.5% unfavorable impact and the transaction costs related to the pending acquisition of Epocrates which had a 0.5% unfavorable impact.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	The rate was also impacted by ISO disqualifying events which impacted the rate favorably by 2% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	Comparatively, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was not impacted by compensation in excess of tax deduction limits, changes related to the Anodyne contingent consideration or non-deductible transaction costs but did have a favorable impact of 2.5% due to ISO disqualifications.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law reinstating the federal research and development credit for the 2012 and 2013 years.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	Under the accounting guidance on this topic, the effects are recognized as a component of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the financial statements for the interim or annual period that includes the enactment date.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	The benefit related to the 2012 federal research and development credit of $0.9 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity As of December 31, 2013 , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $65.0 million .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , we have outstanding indebtedness of $223.8 million.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	On October 20, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a five -year $100 million revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Agreement ).
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including consolidated leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	The interest rates applicable to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement are at either (i) the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the bank s prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% , and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00% ) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	We paid a commitment fee during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement which varied between 0.20% and 0.30% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	There was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S5	In connection with the planned acquisition of Epocrates, on January 3, 2013, we borrowed $100 million from our revolving credit facility and, on January 9, 2013, we repaid the borrowed amount in full.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S6	The Revolving Credit Agreement was increased by $55 million on January 7, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S7	On March 11, 2013, we borrowed $155.0 million from the revolving credit facility to fund the Epocrates acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P81_S8	The entire amount borrowed under this facility was repaid as of May 10, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	On May 10, 2013, we entered into a five -year $325 million senior credit facility consisting of a $200 million unsecured term loan facility and a $125 million unsecured revolving credit facility ( Senior Credit Facility ).
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	The Senior Credit Facility replaced the Revolving Credit Agreement.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	The Senior Credit Facility contains terms and conditions that are customary to facilities of this nature, and may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance the acquisition of the real estate known as the Arsenal on the Charles, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	We may increase the Senior Credit Facility up to an additional $100 million subject to certain terms, including obtaining lender commitments.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , we had $188.8 million outstanding on the unsecured term loan facility and $35.0 million outstanding on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , we had $90.0 million available on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S6	As of December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with our covenants under the Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S7	We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to finance our strategic initiatives, to make payments on our contractual obligations, and to purchase property and equipment in the foreseeable future.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S8	Our analysis is supported by the growth in our new customer base and a high rate of renewal with our existing customers and the corresponding increase in billings and collections.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P82_S9	There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under these credit facilities or obtain additional financing.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Commitments We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the 2014 fiscal year.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , is primarily due to a $37.8 million increase in net income after non-cash adjustments are added back.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	The increase in non-cash adjustments reflects an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $32.7 million , primarily the result of the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles, and an increase in stock-based compensation of $15.4 million .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	The increase in stock-based compensation is the result of an increase in the fair value of recently issued stock-based awards due to an increase in the stock price, as well as the accelerated vesting of stock awards related to the termination of certain employees associated with the integration of Epocrates.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	The change in cash (used in) provided by operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , is mainly driven by a $8.6 million decrease on the cash used related to accounts receivable, a $6.1 million change on the cash provided/used related to deferred revenue, and a $3.9 million related to the cash used for accrued expenses, all offset by the $8.8 million decrease in the cash provided by the prepaid and other assets.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	The changes in cash used in the accounts receivable is a result of the Epocrates transaction, as typically a portion of each Epocrates clinical information services contract is billed upfront, with the balance paid upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	The change on the cash provided/used related to deferred revenue is due to a decrease in the amount of implementation fees collected upfront, as small group practices are only doing remote implementations and therefore there is no charge for implementation.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition, Epocrates deferred revenue is normally billed, collected and recognized over a period of one year which has decreased the rate in which deferred revenue contributes to our cash inflows from working capital.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	The changes related to accrued expenses are primarily due to timing of invoices.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	The changes in prepaid and other assets is due to the fact we are currently in an income taxes receivable position and we continue to offset a portion of our income tax assessments with net operating losses from prior years and tax benefits from current year as shown by the excess tax benefit amounts.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	The amount of excess tax benefit utilized was lower in the current year due to a lower pre-tax net income in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $424.8 million to $424.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for the acquisitions of Epocrates of $242.8 million, net of cash acquired, and the Arsenal on the Charles of $167.3 million .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	The increase in net cash used in investing activities is also attributable to increases in purchases of property and equipment of $14.4 million and increases in capitalized software development costs of $13.5 million .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	We make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Our increased investment in property for the period ended December 31, 2013, consists of our expansion to support our growth, including the build-out of our Corporate headquarters.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	Our increased investment in equipment for the period ended December 31, 2013 consists primarily of purchases of technology infrastructure to provide service stability and additional capacity to support our expanding client base.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	Our investment in software development consists of company-managed design, development, and testing of new application functionality.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	The increase in capitalized software development costs for the period ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the period ended December 31, 2012 , is primarily related to the new automation activities related to the new athenaCoordinator service offering as well as our athenaClinicals offering.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S5	We expect these investments to increase in the foreseeable future to support our continued growth and new service offerings, as well as to support expansion in four of our locations during 2014, including our Corporate headquarters and new office space.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S6	These increases in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , are partially offset by a $12.8 million decrease in net proceeds and purchases of investments.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S7	The net change in proceeds and purchases of our available-for-sale investments is based upon the changes in maturity of our investments in securities, and additionally, we decreased the amount of available-for-sale investments in 2013 due to the the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles property.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S8	Financing Cash Flow Activities Net cash provided by financing activities increased $214.6 million to $241.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to cash provided by financing activities of $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_14_ITEM7_P89_S9	Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , is primarily attributable to the $200.0 million in proceeds from our term loan which we utilized in our acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles, and $35.0 million received in net proceeds from our line of credit.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	The increase in cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, is mainly attributable to the actual and proportionate increase in the amount of non-cash adjustments compared to the net income for those periods.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	The non-cash adjustments include an increase of stock-based compensation of $8.3 million and depreciation and amortization of $10.1 million offset by a decrease in the change in fair value of the contingent consideration of $5.1 million when comparing these periods.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	The increase in stock-based compensation is a result of an increase in the fair value of recently issued stock-based awards due to an increase in the stock price.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P90_S3	We continue to offset our portion of our income tax assessments with net operating losses from stock based compensation from prior years and tax benefits from current year exercises as shown by the excess tax benefit amounts.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P90_S4	We no longer have significant net operating losses from prior years and expect the amount of taxes paid will increase in future years.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The year over year decrease in cash used in operating assets and liabilities is mainly driven by the change in deferred revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	The increase in the deferred revenue balance of $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, is primarily due to the fact that we began waiving implementation fees for remote implementations and for some sales offerings.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	The cash used by investing activities decreased $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment, capitalized software development costs, and our investment activities.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	We make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Our investment in equipment consists primarily of purchases of technology infrastructure to provide service stability and additional capacity to support our expanding client base.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	Our increase of $7.2 million in equipment is primarily related to several new servers for our new data center located in Dallas, Texas and existing data centers located in Bedford, Massachusetts, and Belfast, Maine, as well as build out of new leasehold and building improvements to accommodate our headcount growth.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Our investment in software development consists of company managed-design, development, and testing of new application functionality.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	Our capitalized software development costs increased by $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily related to the new automation activities related to the new athenaCoordinator service offering as well as our athenaClinicals service offering.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	The change of restricted cash is due to the timing of the payments made for contingent consideration relating to the Anodyne acquisition completed in 2009.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2012, we acquired Healthcare Data Services, LLC for $5.8 million.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2011, we acquired a conference center located in Maine for $7.0 million and Proxsys for $27.9 million.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	The net change in proceeds and purchases of our available for sale investments is based upon the changes in maturity of our investments in securities.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	We decreased the amount of available for sale investments at December 31, 2012, in anticipation of the proposed acquisition of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles property that we anticipate will both close in the first half of 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	The cash provided by financing activities was $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P95_S3	The change is primarily attributable to the $9.7 million payment related to our debt and interest rate swap in 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P95_S4	We elected to repay all of our outstanding debt balances under our equipment line of credit and term loan, as well as terminate our related interest rate derivative in May 2011.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	The increase of $4.6 million in cash received from the exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, is primarily due to the overall increase in the strike price of the options exercised along with an increase in the number of options exercised during the comparable time periods.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	This increase was offset by an increase of $4.2 million related to the cash paid to settle tax obligations through the net settlement method that our employees can elect when restricted stock units vest in the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	units in 2010 and have since experienced an increase in the proportionate number of restricted stock units granted compared to options granted.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	We expect that the cash paid to settle tax obligations will increase in the near future as these issued restricted stock units begin to vest.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The payment of contingent consideration relates to the portion of the Anodyne contingent consideration that was accrued at acquisition date.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	We expect that our cash flows from financing activities will increase in the near future as we anticipate that we will need to borrow to fund the pending transactions discussed in the Recent Developments section.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013 :
1131096_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	(1) We have cash interest requirements due on the Senior Credit Facility payable at variable rates which are not included in the above table.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	The commitments under our operating leases shown above consist primarily of lease payments for our offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Alpharetta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Austin, Texas; San Francisco, California; San Mateo, California; Ewing, New Jersey; Princeton, New Jersey; Durham, North Carolina; and Chennai, India.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	Other consists of uncertain tax benefits.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	We have not utilized these uncertain tax benefits, nor do we have an expectation of when these uncertain tax benefits would be challenged.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P100_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1131096_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	Other than our operating leases for office space, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	None of our consolidated revenues are generated outside the United States.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	None of our vendor relationships, including our contracts with our offshore service providers for work performed in India and the Philippines, is denominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, less than 1% of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in Chennai, India, and was incurred in Indian rupees.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not likely.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We had $223.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we utilized an interest rate swap to manage exposure to interest rates on the variable rate of our indebtedness.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S9	Our interest rate swap is with a major financial institution and is not used for speculative or trading purposes.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S10	We have designated our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in other comprehensive income.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S11	Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, associated with the interest rate swap will be reported by us in interest expense.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S12	We did not utilize an interest rate swap during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S13	We recorded the interest rate swap at fair value, which amounted to a liability of $0.4 million at December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM7A_P0_S14	A one hundred basis point change in the interest rate on our borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2013 , would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $2.2 million annually.
1131096_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are located beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 are (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2013 (the Evaluation Date ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934).
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management evaluated the effectiveness of athenahealth s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , excluding an assessment of internal control over Epocrates, Inc., which was acquired on March 12, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the revenue transactions of Epocrates are being processed by Epocrates legacy systems and under the internal controls over financial reporting existing at the acquisition date.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	All other transactions of Epocrates are maintained on the Company s systems.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Epocrates revenue transactions included in the consolidated financial statements aggregate 9% of our consolidated financial statement amounts for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2013 , our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Deloitte and Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 .
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Changes in Internal Control We are in the process of evaluating and integrating Epocrates revenue internal control processes and controls with ours.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Other than the change noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2013 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over the revenue cycle of Epocrates, Inc., which was acquired on March 12, 2013 and constitutes 9% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting over the revenue cycle at Epocrates, Inc.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P6_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P7_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_14_ITEM9A_P7_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February 7, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P6_S1	Watertown, Massachusetts We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P6_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_14_ITEM15_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P7_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P7_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P7_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P7_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P7_S4	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 7, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General athenahealth, Inc. (the Company , we , us , or our ) is a business services company that provides ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services to its customers.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P13_S1	The Company provides these services with the use of a single instance of athenaNet, a proprietary Internet-based practice management application.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	The Company s customers consist of medical group practices ranging in size throughout the United States of America.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P14_S1	In March 2013, the Company acquired Epocrates, Inc.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P15_S0	Epocrates is recognized for developing a leading medical application among U.S. physicians for clinical content, practice tools, and health industry engagement at the point of care.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P15_S1	The features available through the Epocrates services are used by health care professionals to make more informed prescribing decisions, improve workflow, and enhance patient safety.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P16_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P16_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P17_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including the estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock-based compensation; (5) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (6) fair value of identifiable purchased tangible and intangible assets in a business combination; (7) fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment test and (8) litigation reserves.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P17_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the customer, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	The Company derives its revenue from business services associated with our four integrated services and from subscriptions to and sponsored clinical information and decision support services for our point of care medical application.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P18_S2	Our four integrated services consist of athenaCollector for revenue cycle and practice management; athenaClinicals for electronic health records ( EHR athenaCommunicator for automated, live and online patient communications; and athenaCoordinator for care coordination.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P18_S3	athenahealth s clients typically purchase one -year service contracts related to our integrated services that renew automatically upon completion.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P18_S4	In most cases, the Company s clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P18_S5	The Company typically retains the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Company s clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenaNet, minimum fees, flat fees, or per-claim fees where applicable.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	The Company does not recognize revenue for business services fees until these collections are made, as the services fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	Subscriptions to the Epocrates point of care medical application are entered into by a member via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable license code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	Basic subscriptions are free and do not expire.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P20_S2	Premium subscription fees are assessed on the length of the subscription period, typically one year, and payment occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed, and is recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P20_S3	Premium subscriptions are recognized ratably over the contracted term of delivery, typically one year.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P20_S4	If a license code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	Clients in the health care industry typically enter into sponsored clinical information and decision support service arrangements that contain various combinations of services that are generally fulfilled within one year.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	The clients are charged a fee for the entire group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	Because billings typically occur in advance of services being performed, these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when billed.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P21_S3	Each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P21_S4	Further, the Company s revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return, as we deliver services and not products.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company considers a deliverable to have standalone value if it sells this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is then accounted for as a separate unit; deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion, and the Company allocates arrangement consideration to each deliverable using its best estimate of selling price ( BESP ) if it does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price ( VSOE ) of fair value or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of fair value.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Any discount or premium inherent in the arrangement is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	Multiple element arrangements require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	We maintain a standard price list by service; however, certain incentives, such as discounts, may be offered to clients when they purchase multiple services.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	Such discounting is subject to various levels of management approval and any discount offered is based on the total contract value.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	Due to the specific nature of these agreements and the variability in the amount of discount offered for individual services across multiple contracts, we have not been able to conclude that a consistent number of standalone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established VSOE.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	When we cannot establish VSOE of fair value, we then determine if we can establish TPE of fair value.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Our services differ significantly from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P26_S3	Therefore, we are typically unable to determine TPE.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P26_S4	If both VSOE and TPE do not exist, we use BESP to establish fair value and to allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that product, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, and pricing practices.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Implementation revenue consists primarily of professional services fees related to assisting customers with the implementation of the Company s services and are generally billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation is complete and then, as the service does not have stand-alone value, it is recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	The Company evaluates the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on its experience with customer contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those customers will receive benefits from the Company s current portfolio of services.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the asset carrying value.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P41_S3	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 .
1131096_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	Capitalized Interest Cost Interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically the Company s corporate headquarters campus project and capitalized internal-use software development costs, are capitalized until the underlying asset is placed into service.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the effective interest rate of the outstanding debt by the qualifying costs.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	As the qualifying asset is placed into service, the qualifying asset and the related capitalized interest are amortized over the useful life of the related asset.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	The Company evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	If the fair value of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P47_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company concluded for certain purchased intangible assets that the pattern of economic benefit approximated straight-line method therefore the use of the straight-line method was appropriate as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Accrued expenses and accrued compensation Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of rent escalation payment terms, tenant improvement allowances and other incentives received from landlords related to the Company s operating leases for its facilities.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Rent escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which is recorded by the Company over the term of the lease, including any construction period.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	The excess is recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord as part of the negotiated terms of the lease or reimbursements of moving costs.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	These cash payments are recorded as deferred rent from landlords and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense, over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	arrangements associated with sponsored clinical information and decision support services which is recognized based upon contractual deliverables, and implementation services fees which are recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be twelve years.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	Business Combinations are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	The associated acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; non-controlling interests, if any, are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development ( IPR D ), if any, is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination, if any, are generally expensed rather than capitalized; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will affect income tax expense; and goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P56_S3	The results of the newly acquired businesses operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the combined entity beginning on the date of acquisition.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P57_S5	One customer accounted for 11% of accounts receivable as of the year ended December 31, 2012 due to the timing of receipt of payments.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value share-based awards and determine the related compensation expense.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company generally issues previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options; however, the Company may reissue previously acquired treasury shares to satisfy these issuances in the future.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Certain employees have received grants for which the ultimate number of shares that will be subject to vesting is dependent upon the achievement of certain financial targets for the year.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	Such determination is not made until the grant s vesting determination date, which is the date the Company s fiscal year financial statements are available.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The grant is initially recorded at the maximum attainable number of shares that is most likely to be subject to vesting based on available financial forecasts as of the date of grant.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	ACQUISITIONS Watertown, MA Corporate Headquarters - Arsenal on the Charles On May 10, 2013, athenahealth, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Athena Arsenal, LLC, completed the acquisition of the real estate commonly known as the Arsenal on the Charles, located in Watertown, Massachusetts.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Arsenal on the Charles is an expansive 29 -acre, multi-building, commercial property where the Company was leasing space for its headquarters and related operating activities prior to the transaction.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	The purpose of this acquisition is to allow for future expansion of the corporate headquarters to accommodate anticipated headcount growth.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P68_S3	The purchase price was $168.5 million , subject to working capital adjustments.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P68_S4	The fair value of the consideration paid was $167.3 million , all of which was paid in cash.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P68_S5	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition:
1131096_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions and are based on the information that was available as of the date of the acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	liabilities assumed, but certain items such as the working capital adjustments to the purchase price may be subject to change as additional information is received about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	Thus, the provisional measurements of fair value set forth above are subject to change.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P70_S2	We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	The following table sets forth the fair value of the preliminary components of the identifiable intangible assets acquired by asset class:
1131096_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	The value of any in-place lease is estimated to be equal to the property owners avoidance of costs necessary to re-lease the property for a lease term equal to the remaining primary in-place lease term and the value of investment grade tenancy.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	The cost avoidance to the property owners of vacancy/leasing costs necessary to lease the property for a lease term equal to the remaining in-place lease term is derived first by determining the in-place lease term on the subject lease.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	Then, based on the Company s review of the market, the cost to be borne by a property owner to replicate a market lease to the remaining in-place term was estimated.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P72_S3	These costs consist of: (i) rent lost during downtime (e.g., assumed periods of vacancy), (ii) estimated expenses that would be incurred by the property owner during periods of vacancy, (iii) rent concessions (e.g., free rent), (iv) leasing commissions, and (v) tenant improvement allowances.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P72_S4	The Company determine these values using its own estimates along with third-party appraisals.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	We amortize the capitalized value of in-place lease intangible assets to expense over the remaining initial term of each lease.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	We amortize the capitalized value of above market leases to expense over the initial and expected renewal terms of the leases.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P73_S2	No amortization period for intangible assets will exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P73_S3	The amounts of third-party tenant revenue (included in the line item Implementation and other ) and net loss from the Arsenal on the Charles included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from the acquisition date of May 10, 2013, through the period ended December 31, 2013 , are $9.7 million and $4.8 million , respectively.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for Epocrates, less cash and short-term investments acquired, was approximately $237.6 million , which consisted of the following:
1131096_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	The value of the share consideration for Epocrates common stock was based on the average closing sales prices per share of athenahealth common stock for the ten trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the closing of the acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The fair value of the stock options and restricted stock units assumed by us was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The share conversion ratio of 0.1239 was applied to convert Epocrates stock options and restricted stock units to athenahealth stock options and restricted stock units.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	We assumed stock options and restricted stock units with a fair value of $22.6 million .
1131096_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	Of the total consideration, $13.0 million was allocated to the purchase consideration and $9.6 million was allocated to future services and will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the remaining service periods.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	The goodwill resulting from the acquisition arises largely from the synergies expected from combining the operations of the acquisition with our existing service operations, as well as from the benefits derived from the assembled workforce of the acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	The goodwill recognized is deductible for tax purposes.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P90_S2	Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, and shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P90_S3	Under the treasury stock method, dilutive securities are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the periods and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P90_S4	Securities are excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P90_S5	The following table reconciles the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated:
1131096_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 0.4 million , 0.4 million , and 0.8 million of stock options and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 , respectively, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P92_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had no outstanding debt.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	The following table presents information about the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P93_S1	In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities obtained from readily available pricing sources for similar instruments.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P93_S2	The fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable values which are supported by little or no market activity.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	Money markets, certificates of deposit, U.S. government-backed securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper are valued using a market approach based upon the quoted market prices of identical instruments when available or other observable inputs such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets or similar securities.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	It is the Company s policy to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period; however, there have been no such transfers during any periods presented.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	The estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreement with a certain financial institution at December 31, 2013 , was $0.4 million , based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the interest rate swap (Level 2).
1131096_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	Inputs include preset value of fixed and projected floating rate cash flows over term of the swap contract.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	There was no interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P96_S1	Refer to Note 9 Debt for further information.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as an element of consideration paid with subsequent adjustments recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	At the acquisition date and reporting date, the fair value of the accrued contingent consideration was determined using a probability-weighted income approach based on upside, downside and base case scenarios.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P97_S2	This approach is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which are referred to as Level 3 inputs.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had accrued a liability $0.4 million for the estimated fair value of contingent considerations estimated to be payable upon the acquired companies reaching specific performance metrics over a specified period of operations or time after acquisition.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P98_S2	Anodyne The first potential contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Anodyne Health Partners, Inc. ( Anodyne ) in 2009 ranged from zero to $4.8 million and was payable in one installment based upon operational performance for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P98_S3	Based on the actual operational performance for the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company paid $2.4 million relating to the first potential contingent consideration in March of 2011 .
1131096_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	The second potential contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Anodyne in 2009 ranged from zero to $2.9 million and was payable in quarterly installments based upon the cross selling of the Company s services for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the six-month period ended June 30, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P99_S1	Any amounts not earned in the first potential contingent consideration could be earned under the second potential contingent consideration in excess of the initial $2.9 million bringing the total second potential contingent consideration to $5.3 million .
1131096_14_ITEM15_P99_S2	On December 31, 2011, the Company estimated the fair value of the second contingent consideration at $1.4 million based on key assumptions including a probability adjusted level of 50% for the base case scenario and 25% for the upside and downside scenarios.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P99_S3	The significant judgment related to the estimated earn-out payments by scenario was primarily based on the Company s i) past experience of our cross selling, ii) past experience of the timeline for converting pipeline opportunities into customers and iii) the remaining time period of this contingent consideration.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	At December 31, 2011, a large cross sell customer opportunity was included in the upside scenario which had a 25% probability.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	On March 31, 2012, the Company estimated the fair value of the second contingent consideration at $3.4 million based on key assumptions including a 20% for the base case scenario, 70% for the upside scenario and 10% for the downside scenario.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S2	At March 31, 2012, this large cross sell opportunity was in final contract negotiations with the Company and therefore a higher probability was assigned to the upside scenario.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S3	The time period through which the contingent consideration could be earned elapsed on June 30, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S4	The Company accrued $1.8 million as of June 30, 2012, for the final payment based on the final cross selling results which was paid during the three months ended September 30, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S5	The change in fair value of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , was an increase in the general and administrative line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S6	The Company paid $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 , and $3.9 million over the entire term of the second contingent consideration.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S7	The first potential contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Proxsys LLC ( Proxsys ) in 2011 ranges from zero to $3.0 million and is payable in one installment in the first quarter of 2013 based upon revenue and new sales performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S8	In order to qualify for the earnout payment, the acquired subsidiary must have achieved a minimum revenue threshold which was derived from both recurring revenue and revenue generated from new customers brought onto the service after the acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S9	Once that minimum revenue threshold is met, the amount of the payment is then determined by new sales of the Company s athenaCoordinator service offering since date of acquisition.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S10	At acquisition date and on December 31, 2011, the Company estimated the fair value of the first potential contingent consideration at $2.4 million , the key assumptions relating to this potential contingent consideration included the athenaCoordinator revenue budget for the 2012 fiscal year, which included recurring revenue and estimates related to new revenue generated from new customers based upon the existing sales pipeline and historical implementation timeline and a probability adjusted level of 60% for the base case and 25% and 15% for the upside and downside scenarios, respectively.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S11	The athenaCoordinator revenue budget for the 2012 fiscal year exceeded the minimum revenue threshold.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S12	The downside scenarios included a worse case scenario where the acquired subsidiary did not achieve the minimum revenue target.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S13	Certain contracts that were in an advanced negotiation stage at December 31, 2011, and estimated to close in the first quarter of 2012, did not close during the three months ended March 31, 2012; therefore as of March 31, 2012, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the minimum revenue threshold for athenaCoordinator will not be achieved by a margin of 5 - 10% .
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S14	On March 31, 2012, the Company determined that based on the reforecasted amounts and the pass fail structure of this contingent payment, the probability percentages have been adjusted to 90% for the worse case scenario and 10% for the upside scenario.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S15	On March 31, 2012, the Company estimated the fair value of the first potential contingent consideration at $0.3 million .
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S16	On June 30, 2012, the Company estimated the fair value of the first potential contingent consideration to have no value.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S17	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , the Company did not meet the minimum revenue threshold and therefore zero consideration was earned related to the first contingent consideration.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S18	The change in fair value of $2.4 million is a decrease in the general and administrative expense line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S19	The second potential contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Proxsys in 2011 ranges from zero to $5.0 million and is payable in quarterly installments based upon the cross selling of the Company s athenaCollector services into Proxsys new and acquired customer and physician sender base, from acquisition to the second year anniversary of the acquisition in the third quarter of 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S20	On December 31, 2011, and through June 30, 2012, the key assumptions relating to this potential contingent consideration included scenarios primarily based on the Company s (i) past experience of our cross selling related to the Anodyne acquisition, (ii) past experience of the timeline for converting pipeline opportunities into customers and (iii) the remaining time period of this contingent consideration and a probability adjusted level of 65% for the base case and 25% and 10% for the upside and downside scenarios, respectively.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S21	As of September 30, 2012, over one year after the acquisition, the Company determined that it now had sufficient information into the actual cross sell opportunity base to adjust the scenarios.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P100_S22	The Company lowered its expectations of achievable cross sells within the earn out period for all scenarios and has a probability adjusted level of 60% for the base case and 20% for the upside and downside scenarios.

Epocrates, Inc., et al. , Case No. 519078, was filed in San Mateo County Superior Court (the Court ) on behalf of a putative class of Epocrates shareholders against Epocrates and each member of the Epocrates board of directors.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S1	This complaint challenged the proposed merger between Epocrates and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S2	On January 25, 2013, a similar complaint was filed in the Court captioned DeJoice v. Epocrates, et al. , Case No. 519461.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S3	This second complaint made similar allegations against Epocrates and each member of the Epocrates board of directors and included a claim against us for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S4	On January 31, 2013, the Bushansky complaint was amended to include additional allegations.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S5	Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Epocrates directors breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly agreeing to sell Epocrates at an unfair and inadequate price, failing to take steps to maximize the sale price of Epocrates, and making material omissions to the preliminary proxy statement dated January 25, 2013.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S6	The complaints sought to enjoin the merger, other equitable relief, and monetary damages.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S7	On March 5, 2013, Epocrates and the plaintiffs signed a memorandum of understanding in which the parties agreed to enter into a stipulation of settlement whereby the plaintiffs and all class members would release all claims related to the merger in exchange for Epocrates filing a supplement to its definitive proxy statement regarding the merger with the SEC, which would include additional disclosures regarding the merger agreement, and an agreement to negotiate in good faith regarding the amount of attorneys fees and expenses for which plaintiffs may seek approval from the Court.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S8	On October 4, 2013, the Court granted final settlement approval including a grant of fees and expenses in the amount of $0.3 million to plaintiffs counsel.

1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S12	When the likelihood of a loss contingency becomes at least reasonably possible with respect to any of these disputes, or, as applicable in the future, if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may have been incurred, we will revise our disclosures in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S13	Additionally, we will accrue liability for loss contingencies when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.
1131096_14_ITEM15_P143_S14	We will review these accruals and adjust them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information.

1131096_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Overview athenahealth is a leading provider of cloud-based services and mobile applications for medical groups and health systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our mission is to be health care providers most trusted service, helping them do well by doing the right thing.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	We deliver cloud-based services for revenue cycle management and medical billing, electronic health records ( EHR ), patient engagement, care coordination, population health management, and clinical intelligence and decision support.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	Through these services, we connect health care information and processes and drive meaningful, measurable results for more than 62,000 health care providers in medical practices and health systems nationwide.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	Our model combines cloud-based software, networked knowledge, and back-office work to help keep health care providers profitable and prepared for every change.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our service offerings include: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management and medical billing; athenaClinicals for EHR management; athenaCommunicator for patient engagement and communication; athenaCoordinator for care coordination, population health, and financial and quality management; and Epocrates for clinical intelligence and decision support services.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P0_S6	We offer athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, athenaCommunicator, and athenaCoordinator Core as a package of integrated services called athenaOne.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	In most cases, we charge clients a percentage of collections for our services, aligning our financial results directly with those of our clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	In 2014, we generated revenue of $752.6 million from the sale of our services, compared to $595.0 million in 2013 and $422.3 million in 2012.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on August 21, 1997, as Athena Healthcare Incorporated.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	We changed our name to athenahealth.com, Inc. on March 31, 2000, and to athenahealth, Inc. on November 17, 2000.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	We believe our market opportunity is massive and growing.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P2_S4	Our services have been predominantly focused on the ambulatory health care market.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P2_S5	As we begin to support the full continuum of care, including entry into the market for acute care services, our market opportunity may grow.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	The health care industry is complex, disconnected, and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that cannot support the current needs for collaboration, flexibility, and interoperability.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	A disproportionate amount of communication still takes place on paper instead of via automated communications.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Outdated, inflexible systems and paper workflows create significant costs for health care organizations, which suffer with substantial administrative work, duplicated efforts, and errors.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	The complex business of health care is becoming increasingly more reliant on interoperability the easy, open flow of clinical and financial information.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Whether health systems are moving rapidly or slowly towards value-based reimbursement, the success of health systems increasingly hinge on their ability to engage patient populations and to coordinate patient care across a multitude of settings, while optimizing efficiency along the way.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	By addressing these problems, health care providers can focus on the practice of medicine and free their staff to spend time on higher-value tasks.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	The activities required to ensure appropriate payment for health care services rendered have increased in number and complexity for the following reasons:
1131096_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Legislative reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), has been driving fundamental shifts in the health care reimbursement landscape.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	For example, as part of the ACA millions of additional patients have been required to purchase health insurance coverage.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Health insurers have introduced a wide range of benefit structures, many of which are customized to the unique goals of particular employer groups.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Such insurers also continually update their reimbursement rules based on ongoing monitoring of consumption patterns, in response to new medical products and procedures, and to address changing employer demands.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	This has resulted in an increase in the rules regarding who is eligible for health care services, what health care services are eligible for reimbursement, and who is responsible to pay for health care services delivered.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	It has also resulted in more plans that require a larger proportion of patient contribution for services delivered; these increase the burden on health systems and medical groups to manage and pursue receivables directly with the patient.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Health systems and medical groups need to be continually aware of the diversity and dynamic nature of health benefit plan design.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	While the fee-for-service framework can be complicated enough, rapidly emerging outcome-based payment models are even more complex, requiring health care providers to capture and provide appropriate data to obtain payments.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Accountable care programs also require a much greater focus on care coordination and cost efficiency across multiple health care providers.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	To complicate reimbursement even further, some models, such as Pay-For-Performance, demand that health care providers first identify programs for which they are eligible, and then enroll, identify eligible patients, and record relevant billing and clinical data for each eligible encounter.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P8_S3	These newer models continue to evolve and grow in both number and complexity.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Financial incentives for the use of EHRs .
1131096_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	The federal government enacted a financial incentive program through the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act ) for health care providers who demonstrate Meaningful Use of a certified EHR technology.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	While payments under the program do not represent a sustained market opportunity, they have shifted buying patterns since they were instituted, with many health care providers accelerating their purchase of EHRs and making revenue cycle system decisions tied to an EHR selection.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	In addition to administering typical business functions, health care providers must dedicate significant time and resources to physician orders, including referrals to specialists, imaging centers, laboratories, pharmacies, and inpatient admissions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	This requires a series of communications to ensure the care is appropriate and eligible for reimbursement.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	To process these communications, medical practices often interact with multiple software systems, manage communications via fax, and are challenged with having to contact patients, payers, and other trading partners to effectively exchange the right information to accompany clinical orders.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our mission is to be health care providers most trusted service, helping them do well by doing the right thing.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	In almost all cases, we price our services as a percentage of collections, a strategy that incentivizes us to improve performance and reduce cost through more efficient operations.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	As medical groups and health systems face rising costs and complexity, they need solutions for a diverse set of problems, including the ever increasing administrative work driven by that increased complexity, new, more complicated reimbursement models, partners demand for electronic data exchange, pressure to adopt expensive EHRs, continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards, new payer rules, and the challenges of collecting payments from uninsured, underinsured, and high deductible health plan patients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	We believe the traditional software model fails to address these needs.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P11_S4	As a system of limited connectivity and flexibility, conventional software does not allow for rapid, intelligent evolution of system functionality and client needs.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P11_S5	Additionally, locally installed software favors larger organizations that can afford a sizable up-front investment in hardware and software, plus the staff to manage and maintain these systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	With the traditional software model, the client is still responsible for all of the back-office work from managing claims to handling time-consuming clinical paperwork.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	In contrast, cloud-based software can solve a greater set of problems because it can quickly be updated and delivered to all clients as a single, shared instance of software without expensive installations or upgrades.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	However, there are challenges that require cloud-based software to have corresponding service components, such as processing and sorting a practice s incoming paper documents; identifying and managing payer rules; and having a live operator take patient phone calls after a practice closes for the day.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	Bringing these services, and many more, to our cloud-based software, is the crux of our cloud-based services model.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S4	As our software delivers the right knowledge to the right person at the right time, our back-office services execute work, at scale, that would otherwise fall upon the practice.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S5	The connectivity and system infrastructure we provide would normally be out of reach for small independent practices, which make up a large portion of the health care provider market.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S6	However, because we automate processes and scale work across our entire provider network, we can efficiently deliver our services to medical practices of every size.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S7	By giving small practices the same technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefits not only to those practices, but also to their clinical exchange and trading partners with whom they share vital information.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S8	As practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility enhances our ability to compete, regardless of whether a practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P12_S9	Key elements of our strategic priorities include:
1131096_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Equip providers to win at alternative reimbursement .
1131096_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	As newer payment models continue to integrate cost efficiency and outcomes into reimbursement formulas, new activities will become more important in driving performance.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	Only health systems and medical groups that can fully integrate these activities with their revenue cycle will have visibility into their true financial health.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	These can include coordinating care smoothly with other health care providers, directly tying lab results back to the right patient records, and delivering patient adherence reminders.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	The rules embedded in athenaClinicals are becoming increasingly tied to reimbursement as Pay-for-Reporting, Pay-for-Performance, shared savings, and other bonus payments require specific action at the point of care.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Without the type of automation found in our athenaClinicals service, participation in these payment programs may burden physicians, distracting them from the practice of medicine.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Open athenaNet and build an ecosystem of partners .
1131096_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Through our More Disruption Please (MDP) program, we will ensure that all of athenaNet is open with application programming interfaces for new generations of innovators and entrepreneurs looking to disrupt the health care industry.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our MDP program consists of three major pillars: network, marketplace, and accelerator.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	The network is comprised of innovative thinkers, entrepreneurs, and startups with a shared mission to improve the state of health care.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P15_S4	The marketplace features technology partners with capabilities that integrate with athenaNet, adding value to our overall service offerings and client experience.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P15_S5	The accelerator provides seed funding, free office space, and ongoing mentorship from our experts, advisers, and partners.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Support the full continuum of care .
1131096_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our vision is to build a unified clinical experience that allows providers to cross environments (inpatient, outpatient, etc.) without having to log into different systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	We aim to present a single clinical and financial record, integrating information for the user from any system on which information resides.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	We also intend to expand our service offerings across the care continuum whether organically, through acquisitions, or through integration with our MDP partners solutions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	We believe that technology should enable intimate time between a provider and patient.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Providers should only be given and only asked for the relevant information for that moment of patient care.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	We intend to transform the provider user experience of our cloud-based services platform, athenaNet, through a new look and feel as well as a streamlined version of the clinical chart.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	The enhanced athenaNet will include a refined look, more intuitive navigation, and redesigned home pages for all users.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	The streamlined view will strive to reinforce effective delegation, encourage lightweight documentation, and illuminate the patient s clinical story.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our Services By combining three distinct but interconnected components cloud-based software, networked knowledge, and back-office work we empower our clients to achieve and sustain financial health while staying focused on quality patient care.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	We provide a single instance of cloud-based software to clients through the athenaNet platform.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	Each health care provider across the network accesses the same continuously updated instance of software.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our software is the primary conduit through which we exchange information among clients, payers, trading partners, and our staff of experts.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The athenaNet platform enables every client to benefit from the collective knowledge of all other clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	This networked knowledge is culled, curated, and implemented through our patented billing rules engine and clinical quality management engine.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	As we work with clients, payers, and other partners, more expert knowledge is infused into each service, making the network smarter and more powerful for all clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	This work ranges from receiving, scanning, and delivering incoming faxes to tracking claims with payers.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P19_S5	We automate these processes whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work at massive scale with our teams of experts.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P19_S6	This unique combination of software, knowledge, and work is the core of our service model and value proposition to clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	athenaCollector athenaCollector is our cloud-based medical billing and practice management solution.

1131096_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	At the heart of athenaCollector is the industry s largest database of payer-specific reimbursement requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	This proprietary billing rules engine delivers in-depth insight and knowledge that helps clients get paid by payers.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our rules engine contains information amassed over years, is updated daily based on our research and the collective experience of thousands of clients, and tracks the evolving requirement of hundreds of payers and thousands of benefit plans.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	Clients route their day-to-day electronic and paper-based payer communications to us, which we then process using our patented billing rules engine to avoid denials and reimbursement delays, and improve practice performance.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The core focus of the rules database is on payer rules, which are the key drivers of claim payment and denials.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	By understanding denials, we add rules to the rules database that help the entire client base avoid future denials, resulting in increased automation of our workflow processes.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our back-office service team interacts with clients at all key steps in the revenue cycle, including:
1131096_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	providing proactive and responsive client support to manage issues, address questions, identify training needs, and communicate trends.

1131096_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	This includes distribution of different procedure codes (leveling), incidence of different diagnoses, timeliness of turnaround by lab companies and other intermediaries, and other key performance indicators.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our cloud-based platform enables health information exchange so patients can smoothly transition across care settings.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our unique, powerful quality management engine is continuously updated with clinical guidelines, rules, and value-focused initiatives.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	As reporting and quality programs have collectively become a greater portion of physician revenue, clinical data must be captured according to the requirements and incentives of different payers and plans.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	This can be very difficult to manage on paper or in a static software system.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our quality management engine is designed to: identify the specific clinical activities required to meet Pay-for-Performance and outcome-based programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid Meaningful Use programs, access medication formularies, and identify potential medication errors (such as drug-to-drug interactions or drug-allergy reactions).
1131096_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	We have a dedicated team of specialists who take on clients clinical paperwork and reporting requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	Health systems and medical groups that use an EHR can still receive a substantial number of paper clinical documents from third parties, creating a significant administrative burden.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	Our service operations team captures inbound paper documents, converts them to electronic format, attaches them to the appropriate patient chart, classifies them according to type, and associates results with the original order where applicable.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	Additionally, even if the provider creates an order in the EHR, the intended recipient may not accept orders electronically; in that case, our service operations team converts the electronically generated order to paper for delivery on the client s behalf.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P30_S5	We also perform many of the Pay-for-Performance program identification and enrollment tasks on behalf of clients so they can participate without significant up-front research and effort.

1131096_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our patient portal enables patients to view lab results, review appointment information, exchange secure messages with providers, update personal information, and pay bills.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	Clients who also use athenaClinicals can choose to allow their patients to view specific portions of their medical record via the patient portal.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	athenaCommunicator enables clients to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	They can set patient or group-specific communication preferences that will automatically tailor communications to the preferred timing and mode of delivery, including phone call, SMS message, e-mail, or patient portal.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	These communication rules allow each patient to receive a personalized experience, including delivery of messages with branding and using the Caller ID of the client, if desired.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	Clients spend a great deal of time fielding phone calls from patients, on topics ranging from scheduling requests and clinical cases to driving directions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S4	As part of the athenaCommunicator service, we provide live operators who field calls on behalf of clients, especially beneficial during peak phone call periods or after hours.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S5	The live operator service includes re-directing automated calls for appointment scheduling, patient payments, and message-taking.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S6	Additionally, we print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of the client to assist with patient payment collection.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P34_S7	Collectively, these activities expand the availability of the medical practice to patients and help alleviate phone burden, freeing staff to focus on more critical tasks.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our athenaCoordinator service offerings include athenaCoordinator Core, athenaCoordinator Analytics, and athenaCoordinator Enterprise.

1131096_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Each of our athenaCoordinator service offerings include software, knowledge, and work; however, we do not break out these components below as we have for our other service offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Core is a stand-alone solution for providers and facilities that receive and fulfill health care orders.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	We created a streamlined ordering workflow between facilities and the providers that use our cloud-based EHR service, athenaClinicals.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	This makes it easy for community physicians to find the facility and providers within our national database.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Core allows providers, via an easy-to-use online portal, to electronically prepare and send a clean order for a referral meaning all the pertinent information needed to streamline care coordination is complete and a patient can arrive at his or her appointment with another physician, or at a hospital or lab, with information already entered and verified.

1131096_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	These services include: clinical messaging, virtual representative services, market research, and formulary hosting.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	The majority of health care professionals using our clinical information services access the free versions of our applications; premium subscriptions for some of these services are available, and some services are sponsored by clients in the health care industry ( e.g. , pharmaceutical companies, managed care companies, and market research firms) that seek opportunities to engage with our network of members.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Epocrates network of members consists of over one million health care professionals, including approximately 50% of U.S. physicians.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	The features available through our Epocrates application help health care professionals make more informed prescribing decisions, improve workflow, and enhance patient safety.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our Epocrates services include software and knowledge components similar to our other service offerings through mobile applications and our medical information team, respectively, but lacks the third component of work.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	We aim to add the work component as we integrate our Epocrates services with our other service offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	In response to changes in the market, and to better serve medical groups and health systems, our research and development efforts focus on enhancing our service offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S5	All of our clients use the same version of athenaNet, with some rules designed to take effect locally for particular clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S6	We continually update our software and rules, and execute frequent, periodic releases of new software functionality for our clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S7	Our software development life cycle methodology ensures that each software release is properly designed, built, tested, and rolled out.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S8	Our software development technologists are primarily located in the United States; we complement this team s work with software development services from third-party technology development providers, as well as our own employees at our development center operated through our subsidiary in Chennai, India.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P48_S9	In addition to our core software development activities, we dedicate full-time staff to our ongoing development and maintenance of our rules database.

1131096_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	These services are generally commercially available at comparable rates from other service providers.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We depend on satisfied clients to succeed, and have aligned our financial goals with that of our clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our client contracts require minimum commitments by us on a range of tasks, including claims submission, payment posting, claims tracking, and claims denial management.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	We also make a commitment to our clients that athenaNet will be accessible 99.7% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Each quarter, our management conducts a survey of clients to identify client concerns and track progress against client satisfaction objectives.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	In our most recent survey, our net promoter score was 42.0% for athenahealth-branded services and 70% for Epocrates-branded services.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	The net promoter score is the percentage of clients who chose 9 or 10 (defined as promoters) less the percentage of clients who chose 0 through 6 (defined as detractors) on a scale of 1 to 10 when asked if they would recommend athenahealth or Epocrates, as applicable, to a trusted friend or colleague.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	In addition to the services described above, we also provide client support services, including:
1131096_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	active, real-time performance monitoring for clients with complex and highly scaled operations.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Sales and Marketing We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of health care providers, medical groups, and health systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	We expect to expand our network by selling our complete suite of services to new clients and cross-selling additional services into our existing client base.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is divided into three groups for sales of athenahealth-branded services: the enterprise team, which is dedicated to serving the very largest managed care organizations, as well as those with high growth potential; the group team, which is dedicated to medical practices with seven to 150 physicians; and the small group team, which is dedicated to practices with one to six physicians.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S4	We also have a sales team dedicated to sales of our Epocrates-branded services for pharmaceutical clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S5	Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S6	Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients, we conduct a consultative sales process, which includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S7	In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S8	We refer to these third parties as channels and the individuals and organizations involved as our channel partners.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S9	In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for providing us sales lead information that results in sales.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S10	These channel partners typically do not make direct sales.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S11	Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as an independent sales representative, a purchasing agent (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or a joint marketer of combined service offerings that we jointly develop with that third party.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S12	In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P54_S13	Our channel relationships include our clients, state medical societies, health care information technology product companies, health care product distribution companies, consulting firms, group purchasing organizations, health systems, regional extension centers, and payers.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Marketing Initiatives Since our service model is relatively new to most health care providers, our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so they will view our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, we have started to use the Epocrates member network as a lead-generation platform for selling our athenahealth-branded services.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our marketing initiatives are generally targeted toward specific segments of the health care market.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Competition We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition in the marketplace.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our primary competition uses locally installed software to manage the various clinical and financial workflow needs within the medical group or health system.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	Other nationwide competitors offer services they refer to as on-demand or software-as-a-service models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P57_S3	Companies that sell practice management, EHR, and care coordination software and services include: ADP AdvancedMD Software, Inc.; Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; CareCloud Corporation; Cerner Corporation; eClinicalWorks, LLC; Epic Systems Corporation; Greenway Health, LLC; McKesson Corp.; NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC; OptumInsight, Inc.; Practice Fusion, Inc.; and SCI Solutions, Inc.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
1131096_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	However, some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with health care providers.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	As a result, these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	These companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, patent prosecution and litigation, and to finance capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	Our Epocrates services compete for users of the types of clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P59_S5	Competitors providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	The primary competition for pharmaceutical promotional spend comes from companies, such as WebMD, that offer other marketing channels to health care professionals.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our market research business competes with companies that recruit physicians for surveys and the recruitment arms of market research companies that have their own survey panels of health care professionals.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	We compete primarily on our ability to reach and communicate with health care professionals under the Epocrates brand, which is recognized and endorsed among health care professionals as a trusted and accurate source of drug and clinical information; the breadth and loyalty of this large and active network is not easily replicated, and it enhances our ability to market our sponsored services.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the services we provide are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws, including regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as additional regulation.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Government Regulation of Health Information HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules .
1131096_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it (collectively, HIPAA ) contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	These are embodied in the Privacy Rule and Security Rule portions of HIPAA.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules apply directly to covered entities, such as health care providers who engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P63_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from the HIPAA-prescribed electronic forms and other forms, we are a clearinghouse and therefore a covered entity.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	In order to serve as a business associate for our clients and provide them with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires the execution of business associate agreements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	Such agreements obligate us to provide adequate written assurances that we will properly safeguard the privacy and security of protected health information exchanged pursuant to each agreement.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	We also must enter into business associate agreements with entities who act as business associates for us.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P64_S3	HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to health care billing must be conducted using prescribed electronic formats.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P64_S4	As a covered entity subject to HIPAA, we must meet these requirements, and, moreover, we must structure and provide our services in a way that supports our clients HIPAA compliance obligations.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	HITECH Act and HIPAA Omnibus Rule .
1131096_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	The HITECH Act, the regulations issued under it, and the corresponding amendments to the HIPAA regulations in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule have altered and enhanced our obligations with respect to protected health information.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	In addition to HIPAA and the HITECH Act, most states have enacted laws related to the security of confidential medical information.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and the HITECH Act, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Government Regulation of Reimbursement Our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	Given the breadth of these laws, they are potentially applicable to our business activities, including the transactions that we undertake on behalf of our clients and the financial arrangements through which we market, sell, and distribute our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	Accordingly, we are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government health care programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	During recent years, there have been numerous legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement future reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement under government programs that adversely affect our business, our client base, or our cost of providing our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Fraud and Abuse A number of federal and state laws, loosely referred to as fraud and abuse laws, prohibit a variety of activities that could result in excessive expenditure of funds on health care, such as the payment of kickbacks, fraudulent billing, and referrals for health care services where a conflict of interest exists.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	These laws include, but are not limited to: Anti-Kickback Laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	Courts have construed the federal Anti-Kickback Law broadly to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of one of the arrangements is to encourage patient referrals or other federal health care program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	There are several limited and narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	There are numerous federal and state criminal and civil laws that prohibit, among other things, the submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	In some cases, these laws also prohibit abuse in connection with such submission and payment, for example, by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing for the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P72_S2	How these concepts apply to services such as ours that rely substantially on automated processes has not been well defined in the regulations or relevant case law.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P72_S3	As a result, our errors with respect to the formatting, preparation, or transmission of such claims and any mishandling by us of claims information that is supplied by our clients or other third parties may be determined to be, or may be alleged to be, false claims under a false claims law.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	In addition to the provisions relating to health care access, financing, and delivery, the ACA made changes to health care fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	The ACA expands false claim laws, amends key provisions of other anti-fraud and abuse statutes, provides the government with new enforcement tools and funding for enforcement, and enhances both criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	The ACA may result in increased anti-fraud enforcement activities.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and health care entities.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	Physicians are prohibited from referring patients for certain designated health services reimbursed under certain federal health care programs to entities with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, unless such referrals fall within a specific exception.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	Reimbursement claims that we submit for care rendered under prohibited referrals could be deemed false or fraudulent, resulting in liability under other fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope and may not be limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government health care program.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	In many states, there are laws that prohibit non-licensed persons from practicing medicine, prevent corporations from employing licensed practitioners, and prohibit licensed medical practitioners from practicing medicine in collaboration with non-physicians, including business corporations.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	Some states also prohibit physicians from splitting their professional fees with non-physicians.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of the physician clients collections or charges.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P76_S3	There are also federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P76_S4	Some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P76_S5	In particular, the Medicare program specifically requires that billing agents who receive Medicare payments on behalf of health care providers must meet certain requirements, and the agent s compensation may not be related in any way to the amount billed or collected or the actual collection of payment.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P76_S6	Medicaid regulations similarly provide that Medicaid payments may be received by billing agents in the name of their clients without violating anti-assignment requirements if payment to the agent is related to the cost of the billing service, not related on a percentage basis to the amount billed or collected, and not dependent on collection of payment.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Electronic Prescribing Laws States have differing prescription format and signature requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	Due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	In addition, effective on January 1, 2006, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated its final E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program regulations.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P77_S3	These regulations, issued pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ), consist of detailed standards and requirements, in addition to the HIPAA standards discussed previously, for prescription and other information transmitted electronically in connection with a drug benefit covered by the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P77_S4	These standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P77_S5	Aspects of our services are affected by such regulation, as our clients need to comply with these requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Anti-Tampering Laws For certain prescriptions that cannot or may not be transmitted electronically from physician to pharmacy, both federal and state laws require that the written forms used exhibit anti-tampering features.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	For example, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 require that most prescriptions covered by Medicaid must demonstrate security features that prevent copying, erasing, or counterfeiting of the written form.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	Because our clients will, on occasion, need to use printed forms, we must take these laws into consideration for purposes of the prescription functions of our athenaClinicals service.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	Electronic Health Records Certification Requirements The HITECH Act directs the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ( ONCHIT ) to support and promote meaningful use of certified EHR technology nationwide through the adoption of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria programs.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	In January 2011, HHS issued a final rule to establish a permanent certification program for EHR technology.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	Our athenaClinicals service has been certified as a 2014 Edition Complete EHR in accordance with the applicable certification criteria.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	United States Food and Drug Administration The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices and a proposed rule for reclassification of medical device data systems under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ( FDCA ).
1131096_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	The FDA has stated that health information technology software is a medical device under the FDCA, and we expect that the FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in health care settings regardless of whether the draft policy or proposed rule is finalized or changed.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	In April 2014, a draft report developed by the FDA was released proposing a regulatory framework for health information technology that promotes innovation, protects patient safety, and avoids regulatory duplication.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	If our computer software functionality is considered a medical device under the FDCA, we could be subject to additional regulatory requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	FDA regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and import and export.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	FDA requirements with respect to devices that are determined to pose lesser risk to the public include:
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecutions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	Foreign Regulations Our subsidiary in Chennai, India, is subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	These regulations include Indian federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws, and qualification for tax status and tax incentives.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S4	We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S5	We have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , we held fourteen U.S. patents and two foreign patents, with a number of U.S. patent applications and foreign patent applications pending.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S7	Our issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2020 and 2031.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S8	We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to protect our brand.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S9	We will continue to file and prosecute applications for patents and trademarks when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies and our brand.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P84_S10	While our patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe the following factors are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage:
1131096_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	a continued focus on the improved financial, operational, and clinical results of our clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	We have a policy of requiring employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P86_S3	Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of health systems and medical groups and our clients in the pharmaceutical industry.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P87_S2	Our pharmaceutical clients budgeting process impacts the timing of revenue related to sales of sponsored clinical information and decision support services, which has historically been highest in the fourth quarter.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P87_S3	In addition, as further explained in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2014 , we had 3,676 full-time employees, with 1,797 in service operations, 582 in sales and marketing, 952 in research and development, and 345 in general and administrative functions.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	Of these full-time employees, 3,211 were located in the U.S. and 465 were located in Chennai, India.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	The financial information required under this Item 1 is incorporated herein by reference to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Where You Can Find More Information Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, proxy and information statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a), 14, and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available through the Investors portion of our website ( www.athenahealth.com ) free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1131096_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other securities filings unless specifically incorporated herein by reference.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	The public may read and copy these materials at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P90_S3	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P90_S4	In addition, our filings with the SEC may be accessed through the SEC s Interactive Data Electronic Applications ( IDEA ) system at http://www.sec.gov.
1131096_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	All statements made in any of our securities filings, including all forward-looking statements or information, are made as of the date of the document in which the statement is included, and we do not assume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The provision by third parties of medical billing and practice management services to medical practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty, a limited set of payers, or a limited geographical area.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We anticipate that the software, statistical, and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	EHR and practice management software for health systems and medical groups has historically been dominated by large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Some of these entities are now offering hosted services or a software-as-a-service model under which software is centrally administered, and these vendors may also provide administrative and billing services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The size, financial strength, and breadth of offerings of the larger entities are increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and health care industries.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We expect large integrated technology companies to continue to become more active in our markets, both through acquisition and internal investment.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, a few smaller companies have started providing single-instance, Internet-based software using a model similar to ours; the offerings of these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage of our services and impact our market share.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Further, while the market for patient engagement and care coordination services is growing and is not as yet dominated by a small group of vendors with significant resources, our patient engagement and care coordination services face competition from a wide variety of market participants.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	For example, certain health systems have developed their own patient portals or care coordination systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S8	If we fail to distinguish our patient engagement and care coordination offerings from the other options available to health care providers, the demand for and market share of those offerings may decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S9	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, we compete with other companies for users of the types of drug and clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from our pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S10	We compete within a broad industry of health care content providers for the attention of health care professionals who can choose to use mobile, online or print media to reference clinical information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S11	Companies providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S12	Competition from each of these sources of clinical reference content may lead to a loss of our existing network members and a reduction in the rate at which we attract new members for our clinical information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S13	Our primary competition for the promotional spend available from our pharmaceutical clients in the area of interactive services is from companies, including WebMD, that help such companies market their products, programs, and services to health care professionals.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S14	Our market research business competes with numerous companies that recruit physicians to participate in surveys in a variety of formats, as well as the recruitment arms of market research companies that have assembled their own survey panels of health care professionals.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S15	To the extent competing channels are available to access health care professionals, including physicians, the value of our interactive services to our clients is reduced.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S16	Some of our current large competitors, such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Cerner Corporation; Epic Systems Corporation; NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC; McKesson Corp.; Quality Systems, Inc.; and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S17	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S18	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S19	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S20	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S21	Further, in light of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P4_S22	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition to new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target markets.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but that offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If we are unable to retain existing members of our Epocrates network and attract new members, especially physician members with desired characteristics for our interactive services who actively participate in those services, our revenue will decline, the anticipated benefits of our Epocrates acquisition may not be realized, and our business will suffer.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Most of the members of our Epocrates network use only our free drug reference product and may stop using the products at any time without loss.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Members who subscribe to our premium drug and clinical reference products usually do so for a term of one year and may elect to cancel the subscription for any renewal terms.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Under certain circumstances, our members may cancel their subscriptions prior to expiration.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Factors that may affect the retention rate of our existing members and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools include:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unless we are able to provide current, relevant, and reliable health care content, drug and clinical reference tools, formulary hosting, and other services that meet and continue to meet the needs of health care professionals, including physicians, the value of those services to new and existing members will decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our provision of such services depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified physician and pharmacist editors and authors, license accurate and relevant content from third parties, contract with health plans and insurers to host formulary information, monitor and respond to changes in member interest in specific topics, and develop new or enhanced services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we cannot meet our staffing needs or develop or acquire needed content at a reasonable cost, if there are errors or omissions in such content, if our competitors obtain exclusive access to or develop content that health care professionals consider superior to ours, or if we cannot meet the needs of our members, the value of our content and services would diminish.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The reputation of our Epocrates brand is dependent in large part on the medical community s continued perception of us as independent from our health care industry clients, particularly pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If health care professionals believe that we are too closely associated with such clients as a result of the revenue we receive from their purchase or sponsorship of our interactive services, the credibility of our brand will diminish.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Although we take precautions to remain independent from our health care industry clients, including separating the development of our application content from our commercial dealings with such clients and clearly labeling the source and responsibility of sponsored messages, programs, and activities, we cannot assure you that the medical community will view our content as sufficiently unbiased.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If the reputation of our brand is damaged, it will be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to restore the quality of our brand with health care professionals and our business could suffer.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the developers of mobile operating systems and mobile devices with which our products and services are compatible fail to remain competitive in the marketplace and to be adopted into medical practice and practice workflow, members will be less inclined to use our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing products and services, including mobile, Web-based, and traditional products and services offered by competitors or through online resources and searches may affect our retention rate and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The availability of download sites such as the Apple App Store SM that offer numerous free or low-priced competing products at one location has also reduced the demand for our paid subscription products.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We expect the use of such sites to expand, reducing the number of paying members for our drug and clinical reference tools as a percentage of total members.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition to the loss of subscription revenue, our inability to attract or retain members, especially physician members with desired characteristics, such as specialty and prescribing habits, who update their mobile devices through our servers with sufficient frequency, may cause an even more significant decline in revenue from our interactive services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients are attracted to our large, engaged member network for the delivery of their clinical messages, formularies, and other sponsored content, and, without sufficient active members who meet desired criteria, those clients may reduce their subscription for our interactive services, and our revenue may decline.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Even if the number of our members is not materially reduced, their participation in our services may decrease, which could impact our revenues.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We have established limits on the number and the mix of sponsored and non-sponsored messages delivered to members in order to promote the quality of members experience with our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S8	If an insufficient number of members update during a given service period, or the demand for promotional clinical messaging sponsorship exceeds the available supply, our health care clients could become dissatisfied with our service.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S9	As a result, we may be unable to grow our interactive services revenue beyond the bounds we have set, as changes to such limits could cause our members to be dissatisfied with our services and the response to our interactive services to decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Furthermore, if our members generally become less responsive to participating in our services, the value of these interactive services will likely decline.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S11	This could cause our revenue to remain flat or to decline.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P9_S12	Finally, if there is a reduction in the number of network members or their participation in our services, certain anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Epocrates, such as increased name recognition and reputation, cross-sell potential, and the market acceptance of joint services may not be fully realized, if at all.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The market for cloud-based services for health care information technology may not develop substantially further or develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While cloud-based services for health care information technology have become more widely accepted, the market for these services remains narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of cloud-based services in general, and for their revenue, clinical, and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to a cloud-based service.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Changes in the health care industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S7	As the health care industry evolves, changes in our member, client, and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S8	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of health care providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Such larger health care organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S11	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S12	General reductions in expenditures by health care companies, or reductions in such expenditures within market segments that we serve, could have similar impacts with regard to our interactive services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S13	Such reductions may result from, among other things, reduced governmental funding for health care; a decrease in the number of, or the market exclusivity available to, new drugs coming to market; government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which health care providers interact with patients, pharmaceutical companies, payers, or other health care industry participants ( e.g. , limitations on advertising to physicians or required disclosure of payments made to them); or adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting health care payers or providers, the pharmaceutical industry, or other health care companies that subscribe for our interactive services ( e.g. , changes in the design of health plans).
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S14	Any of these changes could reduce the purchase of our services by such interactive services clients, reducing our revenue and possibly requiring us to materially revise our offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S15	In addition, our interactive services clients expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to services of the types we provide.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S16	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to clients and users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S17	Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client and user requirements, and sustain market acceptance.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S18	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients or users.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S19	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients and users will want, while offering these services at competitive prices.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S20	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may lose clients and users.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S21	Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients and users, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S22	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S23	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P10_S24	Failure to manage our growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have been experiencing a period of strong growth.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We believe that increasing awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread adoption of our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Promotional activities may not generate an increase in awareness or revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building awareness.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Besides awareness, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Failure to manage our growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; reduce client or user satisfaction; limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources and management attention from other projects, such as the development of new or enhanced services or the acquisition of suitable businesses or technologies.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as access and use restrictions and other contractual provisions, to protect these rights.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Our attempts to protect our intellectual property through copyright, patent, and trademark registration may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S9	While we have fourteen issued U.S. patents (seven applicable to our Epocrates services), two issued foreign patents (applicable to our Epocrates services), and a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending as of December 31, 2014 , the scope of issued patents may be insufficient to prevent competitors from providing products and services similar to ours, our patents may be successfully challenged, and we may not be able to obtain additional meaningful patent protection in the future.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Our agreements with clients and users and with certain vendors and strategic partners limit their use of, and retain our rights in, our intellectual property and proprietary information and grant us ownership of intellectual property created in the performance of those agreements to the extent that it relates to the provision of our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S11	In addition, we require certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition, and assignment of inventions agreements and certain of our vendors and strategic partners to agree to contract provisions regarding confidentiality and non-competition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S12	However, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Further, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in preventing the unauthorized access to, or use of, our proprietary information or the reverse engineering of our technology.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P12_S14	In any event, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technology or authoring clinical information that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or the information we distribute.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, our platforms incorporate open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	For example, some open source licenses require that those using the associated code disclose modifications made to that code and that such modifications be licensed to third parties at no cost.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use, and we could lose the right to use technologies that are the subject of such claims.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients, partners, and third-party service providers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Although many of our partners and third-party service providers are obligated to indemnify us if their products infringe the rights of others, such indemnification may not be effective or adequate to protect us or the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S8	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology or information to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services; or that we would not need to change our product and design plans, which could require us to redesign affected products or services or delay new offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S12	Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including government agencies, patients of our clients, or stockholders.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S13	For example, in May 2013 we purchased the property on which our corporate headquarters are located.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S14	This property is a former Superfund site, and our ownership of it, or any of our other properties, could expose us to liability under applicable environmental laws, as well as to liability as a landlord or as owner of property that may be used by members of the public.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S15	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S16	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P18_S17	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS We depend upon third-party service providers for important functions of our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have entered into service agreements with Vision Business Process Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc. (formerly Perot Systems Corporation), and Access Healthcare Services USA, LLC to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our client service operations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Among other things, these providers process critical claims data and clinical documents.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, we rely on our banking partner, U.S. Bank, for depositing client funds that we collect into our clients bank accounts.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If such services fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation, and operating results could be harmed.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Failure of these service providers to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves, which increases our risk.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We depend on client satisfaction to succeed, both with respect to our cloud-based software and client support services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our sales organization is dependent on the quality of our service offerings, our business reputation, and strong recommendations from existing clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	If our cloud-based software does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert claims against us or terminate their contracts with us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or retain clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We provide client support services to resolve any issues related to our service offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Our client support team may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support, particularly as we increase the size of our client base.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	It is difficult to predict client demand for support services and if client demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly-responsive client support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly-responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective clients, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S11	We conduct operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, unfavorable intellectual property protection, and pandemics.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, client and user satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain clients and users, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In the foreign countries where we operate, local laws and customs may differ from those in the U.S.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For example, it may be a local custom in certain countries for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies from giving or offering money, gifts, or anything of value to a foreign official to obtain or retain business, and requires businesses to make and keep accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Even though we conduct formal FCPA compliance training, we cannot guarantee that our employees, contractors, and agents will comply with all of our policies and procedures.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we or our employees, contractors, or agents fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, government authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S6	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and software engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S9	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S10	For example, Epocrates has experienced high turnover in recent years, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fill all open positions on a timely basis, or at all, on acceptable terms or that the limited exposure to Epocrates business of those hired will not hinder our ability to manage and grow that business effectively, regardless of the extent of their past professional experience.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S11	In addition, our search for replacements for departed employees may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, impact employee hiring and retention, and adversely impact our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P22_S13	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Volatility in the price of our stock or failure to obtain stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under our equity plans may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Furthermore, the requirements to expense equity awards may discourage us from granting the size or type of equity awards that job candidates require to join our company.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If we acquire or invest in companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions or investments, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, additional amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, any of which could harm our financial condition, operating results, or value of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature in the short term, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower-than-expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer-than-expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If the revenue of our clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Under most of our client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S6	With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government health care programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid or initiatives under the ACA, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Also, although we currently estimate our expected customer life for clients of athenahealth-branded services to be twelve years, this is only an estimate, and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated on 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S9	The majority of our clinical information subscriptions have terms of one year, and our contracts with our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients for our interactive services typically range from one to three years.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S10	We cannot assure you that members of our Epocrates network and other Epocrates-branded services clients will continue to participate in our existing programs beyond the terms of their existing contracts or that they will enter into any additional contracts for new programs that we offer.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S11	If our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S12	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S13	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P27_S14	A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete on pricing with other vendors, and otherwise harm our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the states in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of, taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles for our athenahealth services, and the uncertainty as to the timing of the fulfillment of our Epocrates services, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The sales cycle for our athenahealth services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution, although this period can be substantially longer.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation, although some of our new-client set-up projects especially those for larger clients are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated customer life, currently 12 years, or the contract term.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Even if implementation has begun, there can be no assurance that we will recognize revenue on a timely basis or at all from our efforts.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Implementation for a given client may be canceled, as our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or no reason on 90 days notice.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, implementation may be delayed, or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future, for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If implementation periods are extended, our provision of our athenahealth services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the canceled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, the time between the date of the signing of the contract with a pharmaceutical client for a program, the actual fulfillment of the services under such contract and the revenue recognition associated with such revenues may be lengthy, especially for larger contracts with multiple deliverables, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including those that result from that client s need for internal approvals.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S7	These factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S8	As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Because we recognize revenue from our drug and clinical reference tool subscriptions and certain of our interactive services over the term or at the end of the service period, a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results, which may make it more difficult to evaluate our prospects.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S10	We recognize revenue from our Epocrates subscription agreements monthly over the terms of these agreements, which are typically one year.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S11	In most cases, we recognize revenue from our interactive services over the terms of these agreements or upon delivery of each service element.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P32_S12	As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from subscription and service agreements entered into during prior periods.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	subscriptions or service agreements in any one quarter may not materially affect our financial performance in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, we may be unable to adjust our costs, many of which are fixed, in response to reduced revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our services may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make our reported results less indicative of our future prospects.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we fail to meet our current credit agreement s financial covenants, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We currently have a credit agreement which contains financial covenants, including maintaining a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio, and a consolidated senior leverage ratio.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we borrowed $208.8 million under the agreement and were in compliance with its financial covenants.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S6	There is no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with all of the covenants under the agreement, and, if at any point we fail to comply with the financial covenants, the lenders can demand immediate repayment of our outstanding balance and deny future borrowings under the agreement.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S7	This could have a negative impact on our liquidity, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes and adversely affecting our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P33_S8	RISKS RELATED TO OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our applications from operating properly.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If our systems do not function reliably or fail to achieve user or client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us, and members could choose to terminate their use of our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients and members.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Errors may result from sources beyond our control, including the receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information; interface of our services with legacy systems that we did not develop; or errors in data provided by third parties.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S7	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients or members may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Therefore, despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes following introduction to the market.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S9	For example, changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, so we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S10	Because clients rely on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data-including information to assist providers in tracking and treating ill patients-and members rely on our services to provide timely and accurate information regarding medical conditions and medicines, they may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S11	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby give rise to a product liability claim or errors or omissions claim.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S12	Such claims could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of those claims.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P34_S13	While our subscription and services agreements typically contain limitations of liability and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software or content, such limitations and disclaimers may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from related claims.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In light of this, defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share; liability to clients, members, their patients, or others; failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion; diversion of development and management resources; delays in the introduction of new services; injury to our reputation; and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients or members from purchasing services from us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P35_S5	The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If our security measures are breached or fail or unauthorized access is obtained to a client s or member s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients and members may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our services involve the web-based storage and transmission of clients and members proprietary information, including personal or identifying information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce customer confidence and require substantial resources to address.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client, member, or patient data.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely upon users of our systems for key activities to promote security of those systems and the data within them, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	On occasion, our users have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Failure of users to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales, clients, and members.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	In addition, we use third-party technology and service providers, and our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their patients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S6	For example, we depend on third-party service providers for processing claims data and clinical documents for our clients and we partner with other health care information technology companies to offer our clients more seamless integration with those companies through electronic interfaces.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Although we have developed a vendor management program and process for assessment of our partners information security designed to reduce the risk of a security breach, such programs and processes cannot provide absolute security.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our clients may have their own computer systems (whether internally developed or provided by a third party) to manage, store, and transmit clinical and financial data, which may interact with or contain information obtained from our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because we do not control our vendors , partners , or clients information security systems, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of these systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	A security breach of our vendors , partners , or clients system may damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to cancel their contracts, subject us to third-party lawsuits, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S5	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S6	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S7	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S8	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S9	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Various events could interrupt users access to our systems, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S11	The ability to access our systems is critical to our clients administration of care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S12	Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) terrorism and acts of war; (iv) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our systems or those of others; and (v) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our systems or those of others.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S13	We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S14	If users access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to those clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P39_S15	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely in part upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	we carry business interruption insurance, it only covers some, but not all, of these potential events, and even for those events that are covered, it may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events, including, for example, loss of market share and diminution of our brand, reputation, and member and client loyalty.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users or clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we serve our clients primarily from third-party data-hosting facilities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	In the case of a significant event at any of these data centers, we could move operations from that data center to our other data centers within a reasonable timeframe.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S7	However, these facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S8	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S10	Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S11	Our ability to deliver our Internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P40_S12	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable mobile device, telephone, facsimile, and pager systems.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments and meet user expectations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	However, we have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment or service providers, to provide our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users or clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and clients, adversely affect our brands and business, and expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients and members, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including database software from Oracle Corporation and storage devices from International Business Machines Corporation and EMC Corporation.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms; however, it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our services, which could damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract and maintain clients and members, and decrease our revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	While we have implemented certain features and safeguards designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, members, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our software, content, and services are used to assist clinical decision-making and provide information about patient medical histories, treatment plans, medical conditions, and the use of particular medications.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, members, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our athenaClinicals service is utilized in clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Therefore, if these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us by clients, clinicians, patients, or others.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Although the data stored and displayed in athenaClinicals is generally provided by our clients or third parties, and we often have little control over data accuracy, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of health care services or erroneous health information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our Epocrates clinical reference tools and interactive services provide health care professionals with access to clinical information, including information regarding particular medical conditions and the use of particular medications.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, or we introduce inaccuracies in the process of implementing third-party content, it is possible that patients, physicians, consumers, the providers of the third-party content, or others may sue us if they are harmed as a result of such inaccuracies.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control of the information that we publish or provide.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	However, we cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content, and we have had content errors in the past.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages; have our members assume responsibility for medical oversight and dosing decisions; and require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Furthermore, while we maintain general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S6	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S7	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P48_S8	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION Government regulation of health care creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the health care industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Many health care laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In particular, many existing health care laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the health care information and interactive services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate, particularly as we develop and release new and more sophisticated products and services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Some of the risks we face from health care regulation are described below: False or Fraudulent Claim Laws .
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that prohibit submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In some cases, these laws also prohibit abuse in connection with such submission and payment.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S5	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S6	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S7	CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to engage in or overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S8	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software and services relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S9	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P52_S10	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to those clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations .
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In particular, HIPAA includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity subject to HIPAA.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	access by the Department of Health and Human Services to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it (including the omnibus rule promulgated in January 2013) have provided clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	In addition, ONCHIT is coordinating the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the health care sector.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S5	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S6	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P55_S7	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, and their interpretations are no less stringent than ours, we seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our clients, and since we do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of those clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Among our services, we provide automated reminder services to patients, Internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	We believe that reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure of individually identifiable health information have been and are being taken in connection with these services, including the use of multiple-password security.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P56_S4	However, any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and other personally identifiable information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition to false claims and HIPAA requirements, we are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to health care providers and patients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	For example, the federal health care programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal health care program.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws prohibit bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients, vendors, or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Legislation relating to payments to physicians .
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	These laws may be interpreted to cover honorarium payments made to physicians for participation in market research activities sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Because we currently provide market research services involving participants from our member network, the increased adoption and enforcement of these laws and the application of any public disclosure requirements or other limitations may have a negative impact on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to sponsor these activities or the willingness of physicians to participate in the market research.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	To date, we have not experienced a significant reduction in our market research services business as a result of these laws in the few jurisdictions in which they have been enacted and become effective.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	However, we cannot predict how pharmaceutical companies or physicians will respond when such legislation becomes more widespread or becomes effective at the federal level.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P61_S4	A significant decline in the sponsorship of our market research services by pharmaceutical companies or the agencies that represent such companies, or a significant decline in physicians willingness to participate in such studies could negatively impact our operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with health care providers.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal anti-referral laws the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practice clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P62_S4	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws .
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P64_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our practice clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our service fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	States have differing prescription format requirements, and, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Any determination that we or our practice clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P66_S4	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	As a company that provides EHR functionality, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	certified as a 2014 Edition compliant Complete EHR by an ONC-ATCB in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	While we believe that our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability, we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of medical practice claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Although we do not determine what is billed to a payer, to the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our practice clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for health care services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and time frames may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by practice clients.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The practice of most health care professions requires licensing under applicable state law.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities from practicing medicine.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We do not believe that we engage in the practice of medicine and have attempted to structure our services, strategic relationships, and other operations to avoid violating these state licensing and professional practice laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P73_S3	We employ and contract with physicians who provide only medical information to our users, some of whom may be consumers, and we do not intend to provide medical care or advice.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Any determination that we are a health care provider and acted improperly as a health care provider may result in liability to us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Regulation of drug and medical device advertising and promotion .
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We provide services involving promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Any increase in regulation of these areas by the FDA; the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC; or other governmental bodies at the federal, state, or local level, could make it more difficult for us to contract for certain of our interactive services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Physician groups and others have criticized the FDA s current policies and have called for restrictions on advertising of prescription drugs and for increased FDA enforcement.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In response, the FDA has conducted hearings and sought public comment regarding its regulation of information concerning drugs on the Internet and the relationships between pharmaceutical companies and those disseminating information on drugs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We cannot predict what actions the FDA or industry participants may take in response to these criticisms.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P75_S3	It is also possible that new laws would be enacted that impose restrictions on such marketing and advertising.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Our interactive services revenues could be materially reduced by additional restrictions on the marketing or advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices, whether imposed by law or regulation or by policies adopted by industry members.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If the FDA, the FTC, or another governmental body finds that any information available on our website or distributed by us violates FDA, FTC, or other laws or regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state s consumer protection statutes or other new or existing laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, in February 2011 the FDA issued a final rule regarding regulation of Medical Device Data Systems (MDDS), which are systems that are intended to transfer, store, convert, or display medical device data.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	While EHRs are expressly exempted from the final rule, it is possible that future changes in our services could involve the transfer, storage, conversion, or display of medical device data.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In April 2014, a draft report developed by the FDA, ONCHIT, and the Federal Communications Commission, was released proposing a regulatory framework for health information technology for the purpose of promoting innovation, protecting patient safety, and avoiding regulatory duplication.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	To the extent that our software is considered a medical device under the policy or an MDDS under the final rule, or is the subject of additional regulation promulgated as a result of the report, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing software development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Potential health care reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new service types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Our services may be significantly impacted by health care reform initiatives and will be subject to increasing and changing regulatory requirements, any of which could affect our business in a multitude of ways.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Such reforms or changes could render our existing services obsolete, unprofitable, or impossible to provide or make the development of new services more costly, more time-consuming, or impracticable.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S5	Further, where we lead the industry in implementing new standards, changes in or delays in implementing those standards could impact our competitive position in the market.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S6	These effects could, in turn, impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment, further develop services or software, or rework our marketing strategy, as well as reduce our revenue or the demand for our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P80_S7	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and customer service providers, for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Due to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to government regulation unrelated to health care.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	While our services are primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to health care, certain aspects of those services may require us to comply with regulatory schemes from other areas.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Examples of such regulatory schema include: Anti-spam Laws .
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P83_S3	We may be required to comply with current or future anti-spam legislation by limiting or modifying some of our interactive services, such as our clinical messaging, which may result in a reduction in our revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	One such law, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM, became effective in the United States on January 1, 2004.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	CAN-SPAM imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with the sending of commercial e-mail.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	CAN-SPAM or similar laws may impose burdens on our member communication practices and on certain of our services, which in turn could harm our ability to attract new payer and pharmaceutical clients and increase revenues.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Our national cloud-based network allows us access to cost and pricing data for a large number of providers in most regional markets, as well as to the contracted rates for third-party payers.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P85_S3	To the extent that our services enable providers to compare their cost and pricing data with those of their competitors, those providers could collude to increase the pricing for their services, to reduce the compensation they pay their employees, or to collectively negotiate agreements with third parties.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Similarly, if payers are able to compare their contracted rates of payment to providers, those payers may seek to reduce the amounts they might otherwise pay.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Such actions may be deemed to be anti-competitive and a violation of federal antitrust laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P85_S6	To the extent that we are deemed to have enabled such activities, we could be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission and be required to curtail or terminate the services that permitted such collusion.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	As a billing service that offers patient communication and registration services, our employees or those of our service providers may from time to time come into contact with patients who owe our clients outstanding amounts.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Communications with patients that relate to amounts owed may be deemed to subject us or our service providers to federal or state debt collection laws and regulations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Such laws and regulations, if deemed to apply to us, could require registration with government agencies and compliance with significant administrative obligations ( e.g. , to maintain an in-state office with local employees), which could result in increased expenses and subject us to fines and penalties for violation.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Following the disclosure in 2012 of the methods used by debt collector Accretive Health to obtain payment of amounts owed by patients to one of its hospital clients, heightened focus on debt collection practices may lead to additional regulation and greater scrutiny of existing debt collection practices.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use, and dissemination of data, and the presentation of website or other electronic content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security, and access.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Courts may also adopt these developing standards.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	A number of states, including California, have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the release of credit card or other personal information received from consumers.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	In addition, several foreign governments have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S2	For example, the European Union, or EU, adopted the Data Protection Directive, or DPD, imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information online.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S3	The DPD provides for specific regulations requiring all non-EU countries doing business with EU member states to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Similarly, Canada s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S5	Foreign governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities, and our practice management services for practices along the Canadian border and our market research services could each involve the personal information of foreign residents.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S6	Furthermore, in the conduct of our market research activities outside of the United States, we rely upon a third party to identify and recruit respondents for the market research and to comply with the applicable privacy laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S7	We cannot assure you that this third party will successfully comply with such laws or that we would not be responsible for any failure of this third party to comply.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S8	While we have privacy policies posted with our services that we believe comply with applicable laws requiring notice to our users and clients about our information collection, use, and disclosure practices, we cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S9	Whether and how existing local and international privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the Internet and other online technologies is still uncertain and may take years to resolve.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S10	Privacy laws and regulations, if drafted or interpreted broadly, could be deemed to apply to the technology we use and could restrict our information collection methods or decrease the amount and utility of the information that we would be permitted to collect.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S11	The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or services, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S12	In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices, or those of our agents, do not meet these standards could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S13	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S14	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S15	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S16	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P88_S17	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Other relationships permit third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P90_S2	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P90_S3	In each of these cases, we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P90_S4	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided, as well as the channel relationships themselves, may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P90_S5	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P90_S6	Any misconduct by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients, any failure to follow contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and lead analysts or investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, resulting in reduction in the market price of our stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S5	If any of our employees or subcontractors takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S6	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S7	Subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand if we do not participate in such programs.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S8	In the past few years, various entities and federal programs have provided subsidies for services similar to ours, including EHR initiatives.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S9	While we have qualified for and participated in many of such subsidy programs, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S10	To the extent that we do not participate in such programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S11	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S12	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P91_S13	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P92_S3	If a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P92_S4	If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P92_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , we had approximately 38.1 million shares of common stock outstanding, with a large percentage held by institutional stockholders.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P92_S6	Moreover, certain holders of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our 1997 Stock Plan, 2000 Stock Plan, 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and we have assumed the 1999 Stock Option Plan, 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan of Epocrates, under which all issuable common stock has been registered.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P93_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding options to purchase approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock (approximately 1.2 million of which were exercisable at December 31, 2014 ) that, if exercised, would result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P93_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding restricted stock units totaling approximately 1.2 million that, if vested, would result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P93_S3	If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Actual or potential sales of our stock by our employees, including members of our senior management team, pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons, and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and our policies regarding stock transactions, a number of our directors and employees, including members of our senior management team, have adopted and will continue to adopt pre-arranged stock trading plans to sell shares of our common stock that they hold or will hold as the result of exercise or vesting of equity grants.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Generally, stock sales under such plans by members of our senior management team and directors require public filings.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Actual or potential sales of our stock by such persons could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P94_S3	For example, actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P94_S4	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P94_S5	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P94_S6	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	the ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our by-laws.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P95_S2	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally an entity that, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S3	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, stockholders ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S4	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S5	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S6	Therefore, investors are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_15_ITEM1A_P96_S7	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.
1131096_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Watertown, Massachusetts on the Arsenal on the Charles campus.
1131096_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Arsenal on the Charles is an expansive 29-acre, multi-building, commercial property which includes approximately 762,000 square feet of office space.
1131096_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	In May 2013, we purchased the Arsenal on the Charles campus where we were leasing space for our headquarters and related operating activities prior to the transaction.
1131096_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We currently occupy 331,00 square feet of these facilities and lease the remaining portion to third parties.
1131096_15_ITEM2_P1_S3	Additionally, we own a complex of buildings, including approximately 133,000 square feet of office space, on approximately 53 acres of land in Belfast, Maine, as well as a conference and training facility on approximately 396 acres of land in Northport, Maine.
1131096_15_ITEM2_P1_S4	We lease the remainder of our facilities in various locations in the United States, including: Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Princeton, New Jersey; and San Francisco, California; and in Chennai, India.

1131096_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	On July 18, 2011, we filed a complaint against ADP AdvancedMD, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

1131096_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	The complaint alleges that we have infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,343,271 with a listed issue date of January 29, 2002, entitled Electronic Creation, Submission, Adjudication, and Payment of Health Insurance Claims (the 271 Patent ).
1131096_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	The complaint seeks an injunction enjoining infringement, damages, pre- and post-judgment costs and interest, and attorneys fees.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	On September 8, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	No. 6,341,265 with a listed issue date of January 22, 2002, entitled Provider claim editing and settlement system, and U.S. Patent No. 7,194,416 with a listed issue date of March 20, 2007, entitled Interactive creation and adjudication of health care insurance claims.

1131096_15_ITEM3_P4_S4	On January 9, 2012, we filed a motion to stay the case pending completion of the patent reexamination, and on March 1, 2012, the Court granted our motion to stay the case.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P4_S5	We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the amended complaint and will continue to contest the claims vigorously.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P5_S0	Case No. 5:13-cv-945, on behalf of a putative class of Epocrates stockholders against Epocrates and its former officers and directors.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P5_S1	The complaint asserted claims under sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased Epocrates stock in its initial public offering ( IPO ) and claims under sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased shares between February 2, 2011 (the day after the IPO) and August 9, 2011.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P5_S2	On October 8, 2013, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging only claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and voluntarily dismissing a number of the individual defendants.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P5_S3	Plaintiffs allege that Epocrates made false or misleading statements with respect to the fact that Epocrates pharmaceutical clients were awaiting guidance from the Food and Drug Administration on the use of advertising and social media, which caused the clients to delay marketing and negatively impacted the timing of Epocrates sales and revenue growth.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P5_S4	The complaint seeks certification as a class action, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, plaintiffs costs, attorneys fees, and such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P5_S5	On December 9, 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P5_S6	On June 4, 2014, the court issued an order dismissing the complaint and granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S0	complaint, which asserts substantially similar claims as those set forth in the first amended complaint.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S1	On July 14, 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S2	On October 2, 2014, the court granted plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint by October 23, 2014, and denied the motion to dismiss as moot.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S3	Plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on October 23, 2014, which asserts substantially similar claims on behalf of all stockholders that purchased shares between February 1, 2011, and August 9, 2011.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S4	We filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint on November 10, 2014, which was fully briefed and heard by the court on December 18, 2014.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S5	On February 3, 2015, the court requested further briefing on limited issues related to plaintiffs third amended complaint, with all briefing to be completed by February 27, 2015.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S6	We deny the allegations in the third amended complaint and will contest the claims vigorously.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S7	In addition, from time to time we may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1131096_15_ITEM3_P6_S8	We do not, however, currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ATHN.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 5, 2015, was $146.31 per share.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 5, 2015, we had 83 holders of record of our common stock.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P1_S3	Dividends We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P1_S4	We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P1_S5	Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Performance Graph The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.
1131096_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	Set forth below is a graph comparing the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the NASDAQ Composite-Total Returns Index and the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 , assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.

1131096_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables summarize our consolidated financial data for the periods presented.
1131096_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	You should read the following financial information together with the information under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to these consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods.
1131096_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Included in each expense category above is stock-based compensation as illustrated in the table below:
1131096_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, $4.7 million , $2.2 million , and $0.8 million of stock-based compensation was capitalized in the Capitalized software costs, net line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, for which $2.3 million , $1.0 million , and $0.3 million was included in the depreciation and amortization expense line in the Consolidated Statements of Income in those same periods.
1131096_15_ITEM6_P2_S1	The amount of stock-based compensation related to capitalized software development costs in prior periods was not significant.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes to these financial statements, and the other financial information that appears elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements, including those regarding the increased levels of automation and volume of our services; implementation services provided by external service providers; expanded sales and marketing efforts; increased cross-selling efforts among our service offerings; market trends; investments to support continued growth, new service offerings, and infrastructure expansion; activity of stock option exercises and withholding of shares to cover taxes; integration of Epocrates; changes in expenses related to operations, selling, marketing, research and development, general and administrative matters, and depreciation and amortization; liquidity matters; and the expected performance period and estimated term of our client relationships, as well as more general statements regarding our management's expectations for future financial and operational performance and expenditure, profitability, and business outlook.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue; the negative of these terms; or other comparable terminology.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Forward-looking statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	These factors include, among other things, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Except as required by law, we are under no duty to update or revise any of such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview athenahealth provides cloud-based business services that help health care providers achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more revenue and greatly reducing their administrative work burden.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	These services are designed to minimize the hassles that health care providers and their staff face from complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many related tasks that can take attention away from delivering care.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	Our athenahealth-branded services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud-based platform, athenaNet, through which we continuously update and improve our services.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	These integrated service offerings include: athenaCollector for revenue cycle management and medical billing; athenaClinicals for EHR management; athenaCommunicator for patient engagement and communication; and athenaCoordinator for care coordination, population health, and financial and quality management.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	Each service is supported by a model comprised of three distinct but interconnected components: cloud-based software, networked knowledge , and back-office work.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S6	The software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients, payers, trading partners, and our staff of experts.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S7	Knowledge is infused into each service via our rules engine as we work with clients, payers, and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement, clinical quality measures, and other factors related to our clients performance, making the network smarter and more powerful for all clients.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P2_S8	The network s shared knowledge and transparency also allows clients to monitor and benchmark their performance against those of other practices across the network.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The third component to each service is the work that we perform on behalf of our clients.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Wherever possible, we replace manual processes with automation, but where automation is not possible, we perform the work on our clients behalf.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	These services range from receiving, scanning, and delivering incoming faxes to tracking claims with insurance payers.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	This unique service model of software, knowledge, and work is the core of our aligned success model.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	We also provide clients in the health care industry ( e.g. , pharmaceutical companies, managed care companies, and market research firms) the opportunity to sponsor clinical information and decision support services in order to engage with Epocrates member network, and offer the sale of subscriptions to Epocrates premium drug and clinical reference tools to health care professionals.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , we generated revenue of $752.6 million from the sale of our services compared to $595.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , and $422.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S6	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have also increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P3_S7	Our revenue is predominately derived from core athenahealth-branded business services, which excludes revenue from Epocrates-branded services, third-party tenant revenue, and other non-core revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients, connecting our financial results directly to that of our clients and our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Therefore, the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians and other medical providers working within our client accounts, the collections of these physicians, and the number of services purchased.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	To provide these services, we incur expenses in several categories, including direct operating, selling and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	In general, our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our intended growth rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	Our research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future, our overall business management activities, and our infrastructure.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity and to ensure adherence to related financial covenants.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2014, we began to sell go-live and training support services separately from the required implementation services.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Fees associated with required implementation services are included in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, they are being recognized ratably over the customer life.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Go-live and training support services can be purchased by the customer from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, are recognized upon delivery of service.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	Previously deferred revenue balances related to implementation services, including go-live and training support services, will continue to be amortized over those remaining customer lives.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	The effect of this change was not significant, nor do we expect that it will ever be significant, to our consolidated revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S5	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ).
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S6	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S7	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S8	The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained, and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S9	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and assumptions, and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S10	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P5_S11	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition, including our estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock compensation; (5) allocation of direct and indirect expenses; (6) fair value of acquired intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets in a business combination; (7) fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing; and (8) litigation reserves.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, as they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	All revenue, other than previously deferred implementation revenue, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the client, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	We derive our revenue from business services associated with our four integrated services and from subscriptions to and sponsored clinical information and decision support services for our point of care medical application.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our four integrated services consist of athenaCollector for revenue cycle and practice management, athenaClinicals for EHR management, athenaCommunicator for patient communication management, and athenaCoordinator for care coordination and financial and quality management.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year service contracts related to our integrated services that renew automatically.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to our cloud-based network, athenaNet; minimum fees; flat fees; or per-claim fees, where applicable.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	We do not recognize revenue for business services fees until these collections are made, as the services fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the subsequent month and delivered to clients primarily by e-mail.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	For most of our clients, amounts due are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Determining whether and when some of our revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied often involves judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	For example, our assessment of the likelihood of collection is a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	If we do not believe that collection is reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Multiple element arrangements require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable when deliverables are not delivered simultaneously.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We maintain a standard price list by service; however, certain incentives, such as discounts, may be offered to clients when they purchase multiple services.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Such discounting is subject to various levels of management approval and any discount offered is based on the total contract value.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Due to the specific nature of these agreements and the variability in the amount of discount offered for individual services across multiple contracts, we have not always been able to conclude that a consistent number of standalone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established VSOE.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	When we cannot establish VSOE of fair value, we then determine if we can establish TPE of fair value.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our services differ significantly from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	Therefore, we are typically unable to determine TPE.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our calculation of BESP may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	For example, if our BESP is too high or too low for an individual or group of deliverables, the amount of revenue recognized within each reporting period would be inaccurate.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	The amount of deferred revenue related to separable deliverables with BESP is $22.6 million and $22.4 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our estimate of the expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	For example, if, in the future, we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	On the other hand, if, in the future, we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	The amount of deferred revenue related to non-refundable upfront fees is $44.4 million and $41.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Description Judgment and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Subscriptions to the Epocrates point of care medical application are entered into by a member via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable license code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Basic subscriptions are free and do not expire.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Premium subscription fees are assessed on the length of the subscription period, typically one year, and payment occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed, and are recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	Premium subscriptions are recognized ratably over the contracted term of delivery, typically one year.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	If a license code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Sponsored clinical information and decision support service clients typically enter into arrangements that contain various combinations of services that are generally fulfilled within one year.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The clients are charged a fee for the entire group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Because billings typically occur in advance of services being performed, these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when billed.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	Further, our revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return, as we deliver services and not products.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	If both VSOE and TPE do not exist, we use BESP to establish fair value and to allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	We determine BESP for a service by considering multiple factors including an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that service, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, and pricing practices.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Multiple element arrangements require judgment as to whether deliverables meet the criteria to be separated into separate units of accounting.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the client.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Historically, we believed that our past go to market strategy of charging implementation services related to our integrated services was not separable from the ongoing business services, as the implementation services did not have value to the customer on a standalone basis.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	As the service did not have stand-alone value, it was recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected customer life.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	During 2014, we began to sell go-live and training support services separate from the required implementation services.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	Go-live and training support services can be purchased by the customer from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, have stand alone value and are recognized upon delivery of service.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P23_S5	Previously deferred revenue balances related to implementation services that were billed up front and did not have stand alone value, will continue to be amortized over those remaining customer lives.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P23_S6	Also, in 2014, we began to include the fees associated with the required implementation services in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, they are being recognized ratably over the customer life.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Description Judgment and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is then accounted for as a separate unit; deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion, and we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable using our best estimate of selling price ( BESP ) if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of fair value.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Any discount or premium inherent in the arrangement is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Other services consist primarily of tenant revenue which is straight-lined over the term of the lease.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	We determined the estimated customer life considering the following key factors: - Renewal rate considerations - Economic life of the product or service - Industry data The estimated customer life, or expected performance period, for the years presented is 12 years.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Business Combinations, including purchased intangible assets are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Measurement period adjustments relate to adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information that we should have known at the time of acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	All changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant s viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually on November 30th or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Fair value accounting as it relates to business combinations and impairment testing requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets and the fair value of the reporting unit during goodwill impairment tests include, but are not limited to, identifying reporting units, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers, expected future cash outflows, the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and a probability-weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Significant judgment in testing goodwill for impairment also includes assigning assets and liabilities to the reporting unit and determining the fair value of each reporting unit based on management s best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Management s best estimates and assumptions are employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets, which are finite-lived assets.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $198.0 million and $139.4 million, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $198.0 million and $168.4 million, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We derive our revenue from two sources: from business services, and implementation and other services.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Business services includes revenue from our revenue cycle and practice management service (athenaCollector); electronic health record management service (athenaClinicals); patient communication management service (athenaCommunicator); care coordination and financial and quality management service (athenaCoordinator); subscriptions, sponsored clinical information, and decision support services for our point of care clinical application (Epocrates); and consulting, training, and go-live support.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	No customers accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 , December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Business services accounted for approximately 95% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	Business services revenue for athenahealth-branded services is typically 2% to 8% of a practice s total collections depending upon the services purchased, the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice, plus a per statement charge for certain billing statements that are generated for patients.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	Accordingly, business services revenue is largely driven by: the number of physician practices and other service providers we serve, the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians, the mix of our services used by those physician practices and other medical providers, and our contracted rates.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Our pharmaceutical clients budgeting process impacts the timing of revenue related to sales of sponsored clinical information and decision support services, which has historically been highest in the fourth quarter.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Additionally, the volume of activity and related collections vary from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the flu season.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	While we believe that the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season will continue to impact collections by our physician clients, there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Implementation and other services revenue consists primarily of the amortization of deferred revenue on implementation services, as well as third-party tenant and other non-core revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	We expect the amortization of deferred implementation fees to decline, as we have begun to include implementation fees into our ongoing monthly rate in 2014 and charge separately for training and go-live services, which can also be purchased from a third-party vendor.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The effect of this change was not significant, nor do we expect that it will ever be significant, to our consolidated revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	Additionally, we expect third-party tenant and other non-core revenue to decline in the foreseeable future as tenants vacate and we occupy the previously rented space.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Direct operating expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) related to personnel who provide services, including implementation of new clients, and claim processing costs.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	We include in direct operating expense all service costs incurred to fulfill our customer contracts.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	We expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation, with higher volumes of work in particular functions, geographies, and medical specialties.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P42_S4	Although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future, direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenue as we increase automation.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P42_S5	Direct operating expense also includes costs associated with third-party tenant and other non-core revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P42_S6	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, and amortization, except for amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for sales and marketing employees and marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and online initiatives).
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	We have increased our sales and marketing expenses from year to year and we expect to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel and support personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients and to expand awareness through paid search and other similar initiatives.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	We also plan to expand our marketing activities, such as attending trade shows, expanding user groups, and creating new printed materials.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S5	As a result, we expect that, in the near-term, sales and marketing expense will increase in line with revenue growth.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S6	As we begin to leverage lower cost sales channels, we expect selling and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P43_S7	Sales and marketing expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, and amortization, except for amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for research and development employees and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	We expect that, in the near-term, research and development expenditures will increase in absolute terms and will likely increase as a percent of revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services; however, the amount of expenditures that should be capitalized as software development costs versus expensed as research and development could vary based on the specific projects we undertake.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	Research and development expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, and amortization.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for administrative employees, occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), and outside professional fees for accountants, lawyers, and consultants.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development, which we amortize over a two to three-year period from the time it is ready for its intended use.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	As we grow, we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase as we make investments to support our continued growth, new service offerings, and infrastructure expansion.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Other (expense) income is primarily comprised of interest expense.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our term and revolving loans under our credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing fees.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Income tax benefit (provision) relates to federal and state jurisdictions in the United States and India.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	The difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory rate is mainly related to the fact that we are relatively close to break-even in pre-tax net income (loss) and have certain permanent items which include, but are not limited to, transaction costs associated with stock acquisitions, the treatment of Incentive Stock Options ( ISOs ) and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the impact of certain tax deduction limits related to certain of our highly compensated officers, lobbying, and meals and entertainment.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	Transaction costs related to stock acquisitions are primarily non-tax deductible.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to non-tax deductible goodwill and the treatment of disqualifying dispositions related to ISOs are also treated as discrete items, which means that they are recorded in the quarter in which they occur and could cause significant differences between the quarterly and annual effective tax rate.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	We substantially ceased issuing ISOs in 2009, but we expect continued volatility related to these stock options since we cannot anticipate when disqualifying dispositions related to these stock options will occur.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, the ASU provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including, but not limited to, when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	ASU 2014-09 provides companies with two implementation methods.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application).
1131096_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	We are currently in the process of evaluating this new guidance.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	We previously invested a total of $1.1 million in Castlight Health, Inc. ( Castlight ), a leading provider of cloud-based software that enables enterprises to control health care costs.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	This investment was initially recorded at cost.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	On March 14, 2014, an initial public offering ( IPO ) of shares of Castlight s Class B common stock was made available for sale on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CSLT.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	As a result of the IPO, we classified this investment as available-for-sale and marked the shares we hold to market based on quoted market prices.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate fair value of the investment was $41.0 million and is recorded in the Marketable securities line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	The unrealized gain on investment of $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 is included in other comprehensive income (loss), net of a $15.0 million short-term deferred tax liability for that same period.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 :
1131096_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Percentages for each line item may not sum to the totals or subtotals for each fiscal year due to rounding.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase in business services revenue is primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	The increases in the number of physicians and providers using our revenue cycle and practice management service, athenaCollector; electronic health record management service, athenaClinicals; and patient communication management service, athenaCommunicator; are as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The amount of collections processed is as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Implementation and other revenue increased primarily due to third-party tenant revenue and travel reimbursement, which increased $4.5 million and $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Direct operating expense increased primarily due to employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, which increased $28.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 , as a result of a 17% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Additionally, costs associated with external consulting services increased $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	We increased headcount and the use of consultants due to the increase in number of providers added to the network during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	In addition, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing arrangements and clearing house increased $12.8 million, as the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Direct operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 also increased $2.5 million due to costs associated with third-party tenant revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expense was in part due to compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, internal sales commissions, and external channel partner commissions, which increased approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , largely due to a 23% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Additionally, amortization related to purchased intangible assets allocated to selling and marketing expense increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to our acquisition of Epocrates during the three months ended March 31, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	Also contributing to the increase in selling and marketing expense was a $10.7 million increase in our marketing program costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased approximately $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , largely due to a 41% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	The additional research and development personnel were necessary in order to upgrade and expand our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S4	General and administrative expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher compensation costs and facilities-related expenses.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S5	Compensation costs, including stock-based compensation unrelated to the Epocrates acceleration of vesting associated with our acquisition, increased approximately $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , largely due to an 22% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S6	We increased our general and administrative personnel to support our growth.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S7	Facilities-related expenses, which include rent expense, increased $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S8	The increase in headcount drove an increased investment in our infrastructure, which resulted in expansion in four of our locations.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S9	The increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially offset by the absence of $11.8 million of transaction and integration costs we incurred associated with the Epocrates and Arsenal transactions and stock-based compensation related to the acceleration of vesting for certain Epocrates employees upon termination during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S10	Finally, the year ended December 31, 2013 reflected a $2.5 million net gain due to the early termination of our lease and the realization of the remaining balance in deferred rent upon our acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S11	Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S12	This increase was partially due to $15.2 million of amortization related to an increase in our software development costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 , and $6.0 million of depreciation from higher fixed asset expenditures for the same period, including the Arsenal on the Charles which was acquired during the three months ended June 30, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P62_S13	Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to a full 12 months of interest expense in 2014 for our newest debt agreement that was signed in May 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , is primarily due to a decrease in permanent differences related to non-deductible transaction costs associated with the Epocrates transaction in 2013 and our decrease in earnings before taxes.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 41% due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The increase in business services revenue is primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services, and additionally due to revenue from sponsored clinical information and decision support services and subscriptions.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	The increases in the number of physicians and providers using our revenue cycle and practice management service, athenaCollector; electronic health record management service, athenaClinicals; and patient communication management service, athenaCommunicator; are as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The amount of collections processed are as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The year ended December 31, 2013 includes $52.4 million of total revenue attributable to sponsored clinical information and decision support services and subscriptions.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase in revenue from implementation and other revenue was primarily driven by third-party tenant revenue of $9.7 million associated with the Arsenal on the Charles property from the date of acquisition in May through December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	Implementation and other revenue was also increased by new client implementations and increased professional services for our larger client base.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	The number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase in direct operating expense is primarily due to the expense of providing these services, including transactions expense and employee-related costs.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Direct operating employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, increased $28.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 , to the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to a 12% increase in headcount since December 31, 2012 , and an increase in fair value of our recently issued stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	We increased headcount to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base continues to expand and includes larger medical groups.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	Headcount at December 31, 2013 includes 57 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Also contributing to the increase in direct operating expense was amortization related to purchased intangible assets, which increased $8.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 , to the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to our acquisitions of Epocrates during the three months ended March 31, 2013, and the Arsenal on the Charles during the three months ended June 30, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Direct operating expense from the Arsenal on the Charles acquisition date of May 10, 2013, through the period ended December 31, 2013 , includes $4.7 million of costs associated with third-party tenant revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	No cost associated with third-party tenant revenue was included in direct operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, internal sales commissions, and external channel partner commissions, which increased approximately $26.6 million, or 40%, from $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , to $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	The cost of compensation is primarily driven by headcount.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Our sales and marketing headcount increased 34% since December 31, 2012 , as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	Headcount at December 31, 2013 also includes 59 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	Also contributing to the increase in selling and marketing expense was a $9.0 million increase in other general marketing-related costs.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	Finally, amortization related to purchased intangible assets allocated to selling and marketing expense increased $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to our acquisition of Epocrates during the three months ended March 31, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	The increase in research and development expense was due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased approximately $23.8 million , or 70%, from $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , to $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S6	This increase is primarily due to a 68% increase in headcount from December 31, 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S7	The additional research and development personnel were necessary in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S8	Headcount at December 31, 2013 also includes 97 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P72_S9	We anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Employee-related compensation increased $21.1 million, largely due to a 28% increase in headcount from December 31, 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	We increased our general and administrative personnel to support our growth.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	General and administrative headcount at December 31, 2013 also includes 29 employees from our acquisition of Epocrates in March 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Included in the employee-related compensation is an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $7.9 million.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	The stock-based compensation increase for the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily related to acceleration of vesting for certain Epocrates employees upon termination and an increase in the fair value of recently issued stock-based awards due to an increase in the stock price.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S4	The increase we experienced in headcount drove an increased investment in our infrastructure of $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S5	Additionally, transaction costs associated with the Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles acquisitions increased general and administrative expenses by $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S6	These costs were partially offset by a $2.5 million net gain in the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to the early termination of our lease and the realization of the remaining balance in deferred rent upon acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles property where our corporate headquarters are located in Watertown, Massachusetts.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P74_S7	Comparatively, in the year ended December 31, 2012 , there was a net fair value adjustment of a $5.1 million credit related to contingent consideration compared to a less than $0.1 million charge in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was $43.6 million , an increase of approximately $17.9 million , or 70%, from depreciation and amortization of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation from fixed asset expenditures in 2013 and 2012, the acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles, and higher amortization related to an increase in our software development costs of $8.9 million, $2.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding compared to the prior year.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The change from an income tax provision to an income tax benefit is primarily due to lower pre-tax income and an increase in research and development tax credits, offset by larger permanent items for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Research and development tax credits increased $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	This increase is primarily attributable to completion of a multi-year research and development tax study.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	Additionally, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law reinstating the federal research and development credit for the 2012 and 2013 years.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P76_S4	Under the accounting guidance on this topic, the effects are recognized as a component of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the financial statements for the period that includes the enactment date.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P76_S5	The benefit related to the 2012 federal research and development credit of $0.9 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P76_S6	The offsetting higher permanent items for the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily due to non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of Epocrates of $2.2 million.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity As of December 31, 2014 , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $114.7 million compared to $65.0 million as of December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we have outstanding indebtedness of $208.8 million compared to $223.8 million as of December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	The decrease in our indebtedness as of December 31, 2014 is due to periodic payments on our credit agreement, which was entered into primarily to fund our purchase of the Arsenal on the Charles.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	On October 20, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement which provided for a five -year $100.0 million revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility ).
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Revolving Credit Facility contained certain covenants, including consolidated leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	The interest rates applicable to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility were at either (i) the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the bank s prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% , and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00% ) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	We paid a commitment fee during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility which varied between 0.20% and 0.30% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S4	There was no balance outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2012.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S5	In connection with the planned acquisition of Epocrates, on January 3, 2013, we borrowed $100.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility and, on January 9, 2013, we repaid the borrowed amount in full.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S6	The Revolving Credit Facility was increased by $55.0 million on January 7, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S7	On March 11, 2013, we borrowed $155.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility to fund the Epocrates acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P78_S8	The entire amount borrowed under this facility was repaid as of May 10, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	On May 10, 2013, we entered into a five -year $325.0 million senior credit facility consisting of a $200.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $125.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Senior Credit Facility ).
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Senior Credit Facility replaced the Revolving Credit Facility.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	The Senior Credit Facility contains terms and conditions that are customary to facilities of this nature, and may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance the acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	We may increase the Senior Credit Facility up to an additional $100.0 million subject to certain terms, including obtaining lender commitments.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , we had $173.8 million outstanding on the unsecured term loan facility and $35.0 million outstanding on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , we had $90.0 million available on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with our covenants under the Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P79_S7	We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to finance our strategic initiatives, to make payments on our contractual obligations, and to purchase property and equipment in the foreseeable future.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under these credit facilities or obtain additional financing.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Commitments We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the 2015 fiscal year.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Operating Cash Flow Activities The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to an increase in net income after non-cash adjustments due to our growth in operations.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	The non-cash adjustments include an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $32.0 million resulting from the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities is due in part to an $26.3 million increase in accrued compensation due to our headcount growth.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	Further, the purchase of the Arsenal on the Charles, which we previously leased, and our recent execution of new leases which include free rent and other leasehold incentives, provided an additional increase of $12.1 million .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S4	These increases in cash was offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to our growth, which decreased cash provided by operating activities by $34.4 million in the period.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S5	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $297.6 million to $127.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S6	In the prior year, our spend included cash paid for the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles of $ 410.2 million , net of cash acquired, which was offset by $ 56.2 million of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S7	We have increased our investments in property and equipment in 2014 by $ 76.1 million .
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S8	In conjunction with our 2013 purchase of the Arsenal on the Charles, our Board of Directors approved a plan to improve the campus for our employees and to open the space to local residents.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S9	We began to recognize costs associated with this plan in 2014 and expect these investments to increase in the foreseeable future to support our continued growth and new service offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S10	Additional capital expenditures also relate to expansion in four of our office locations during 2014.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P83_S11	We have increased our investment in software development costs in 2014 by $ 53.5 million , and we expect investments to continue to increase as we develop and enhance new and existing services.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Financing Cash Flow Activities Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities decreased $254.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to the receipt of $200.0 million in proceeds from our term loan and $35.0 million in net proceeds from our line of credit during the year ended December 31, 2013, which we utilized in our acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles in the prior year.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that income taxes paid for the net settlement of stock unit awards will be greater than the cash received for stock option exercises because of the recent increase in our stock price and the increase in the issuance of restricted stock units compared to stock options.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Operating Cash Flow Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, is primarily due to a $37.8 million increase in net income after non-cash adjustments are added back.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The increase in non-cash adjustments reflects an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $32.7 million, primarily the result of the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles, and an increase in stock-based compensation of $15.4 million.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	The increase in stock-based compensation is the result of an increase in the fair value of recently issued stock-based awards due to an increase in the stock price, as well as the accelerated vesting of stock awards related to the termination of certain employees associated with the integration of Epocrates.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	used for accrued expenses, all offset by the $8.8 million decrease in the cash provided by the prepaid and other assets.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	The changes in cash used in the accounts receivable is a result of the Epocrates transaction, as typically a portion of each Epocrates clinical information services contract is billed upfront, with the balance paid upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	The change on the cash provided/used related to deferred revenue is due to a decrease in the amount of implementation fees collected upfront, as small group practices are only doing remote implementations and therefore there is no charge for implementation.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition, Epocrates deferred revenue is normally billed, collected and recognized over a period of one year which has decreased the rate in which deferred revenue contributes to our cash inflows from working capital.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	The changes related to accrued expenses are primarily due to timing of invoices.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	The changes in prepaid and other assets is due to the fact we are currently in an income taxes receivable position and we continue to offset a portion of our income tax assessments with net operating losses from prior years and tax benefits from current year as shown by the excess tax benefit amounts.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	The amount of excess tax benefit utilized was lower in the current year due to a lower pre-tax net income in the year ended December 31, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $424.8 million to $424.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for the acquisitions of Epocrates of $242.8 million, net of cash acquired, and the Arsenal on the Charles of $167.3 million.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	The increase in net cash used in investing activities is also attributable to increases in purchases of property and equipment of $14.4 million and increases in capitalized software development costs of $13.5 million.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	We make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Our increased investment in property for the period ended December 31, 2013, consists of our expansion to support our growth, including the build-out of our Corporate headquarters.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Our increased investment in equipment for the period ended December 31, 2013 consists primarily of purchases of technology infrastructure to provide service stability and additional capacity to support our expanding client base.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	Our investment in software development consists of company-managed design, development, and testing of new application functionality.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S4	The increase in capitalized software development costs for the period ended December 31, 2013, compared to the period ended December 31, 2012, is primarily related to the new automation activities related to the new athenaCoordinator service offering as well as our athenaClinicals offering.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S5	We expect these investments to increase in the foreseeable future to support our continued growth and new service offerings, as well as to support expansion in four of our locations during 2014, including our Corporate headquarters and new office space.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S6	These increases in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, are partially offset by a $12.8 million decrease in net proceeds and purchases of investments.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S7	The net change in proceeds and purchases of our available-for-sale investments is based upon the changes in maturity of our investments in securities, and additionally, we decreased the amount of available-for-sale investments in 2013 due to the the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles property.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S8	Financing Cash Flow Activities Net cash provided by financing activities increased $214.6 million to $241.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S9	Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, is primarily attributable to the $200.0 million in proceeds from our term loan which we utilized in our acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles, and $35.0 million received in net proceeds from our line of credit.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P89_S10	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2014 :
1131096_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	(1) We have cash interest requirements due on the Senior Credit Facility payable at variable rates which are not included in the above table.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	(2) We are party to agreements for non-cancelable operating leases for office space and data centers which expire between 2014 and 2029.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	(3) Other consists of uncertain tax benefits.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	We have not recognized these uncertain tax benefits, nor do we have an expectation of when these uncertain tax benefits would be challenged.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1131096_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	Other than our operating leases, which are primarily for office space and data centers, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	None of our consolidated revenues are generated outside of the United States.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	None of our vendor relationships, including our contracts with our offshore service providers for work performed in India and the Philippines, is denominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 , approximately 1% of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in Chennai, India, and was incurred in Indian rupees.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not likely.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We had $208.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2014 .
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	A one hundred basis point change in the interest rate on our borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2014 would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $0.7 million annually.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we utilized an interest rate swap to manage exposure to interest rates on the variable rate of our indebtedness.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Our interest rate swap is with a major financial institution and is not used for speculative or trading purposes.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	We have designated our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in other comprehensive income.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, associated with the interest rate swap will be reported in interest expense.
1131096_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	We recorded the interest rate swap at fair value, which amounted to a liability of $0.2 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , respectively.

1131096_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2014 (the Evaluation Date ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934).
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	evaluation described above that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P2_S4	In conducting this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2014 , our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Deloitte and Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Changes in Internal Control There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the three months ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_15_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P6_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P6_S1	Watertown, Massachusetts We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P6_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_15_ITEM15_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P7_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P7_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P7_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P7_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P7_S4	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General athenahealth, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our ) is a business services company that provides ongoing billing, clinical-related, and other related services to its customers.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	Our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud-based platform, athenaNet, through which we continuously update and improve our services.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P13_S2	Our customers consist of medical group practices ranging in size throughout the United States of America.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P13_S3	In March 2013, we acquired Epocrates, Inc.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	Epocrates is recognized for developing a leading medical application among U.S. physicians for clinical content, practice tools, and health industry engagement at the point of care.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P14_S1	The features available through the Epocrates services are used by health care providers to make more informed prescribing decisions, improve workflow, and enhance patient safety.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P16_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition; including the estimated expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock-based compensation; (5) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (6) fair value of identifiable purchased tangible and intangible assets in a business combination; (7) fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing; and (8) litigation reserves.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P16_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ), or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company, which uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has determined that it operates in one segment and the CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, uses non-GAAP adjusted operating income (defined as GAAP net (loss) income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes, total other income (expense), stock-based compensation expense, amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development, amortization of purchased intangible assets, integration costs, transaction costs, and gain on early termination of lease) as the measure of our profit on a regular basis.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we acquired and integrated two significant businesses and re-evaluated our operating segments.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , our CODM determined that the acquired businesses are so closely integrated, that he reviews and assesses the business as one operating segment.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the customer, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	We derive revenue from business services associated with our four integrated services and from subscriptions to and sponsored clinical information and decision support services for our point of care medical application.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P19_S2	Our four integrated services consist of athenaCollector for revenue cycle and practice management, athenaClinicals for electronic health records ( EHR ) management, athenaCommunicator for patient communication management, and athenaCoordinator for care coordination and financial and quality management.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P19_S3	Our clients typically purchase one -year service contracts for our integrated services that renew automatically.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P19_S4	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P19_S5	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to our cloud-based network, athenaNet; minimum fees; flat fees; or per-claim fees, where applicable.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P20_S1	We do not recognize revenue for business services fees until these collections are made, as the services fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P20_S2	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	Subscriptions to the Epocrates point of care medical application are entered into by a member via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable license code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	Basic subscriptions are free and do not expire.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	typically one year, and payment occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed, and are recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	Premium subscriptions are recognized ratably over the contracted term of delivery, typically one year.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P22_S2	If a license code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	Sponsored clinical information and decision support service clients typically enter into arrangements that contain various combinations of services that are generally fulfilled within one year.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	The clients are charged a fee for the entire group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P23_S2	Because billings typically occur in advance of services being performed, these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when billed.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P23_S3	Each service deliverable within these multiple element revenue arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P23_S4	Further, our revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return, as we deliver services and not products.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately, if the item is sold by another vendor, or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is then accounted for as a separate unit; deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion, and we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable using our best estimate of selling price ( BESP ) if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of fair value.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	Any discount or premium inherent in the arrangement is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	Multiple element arrangements require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	We maintain a standard price list by service; however, certain incentives, such as discounts, may be offered to clients when they purchase multiple services.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	Such discounting is subject to various levels of management approval and any discount offered is based on the total contract value.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P26_S2	Due to the specific nature of these agreements and the variability in the amount of discount offered for individual services across multiple contracts, we have not been able to conclude that a consistent number of standalone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established VSOE.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	When we cannot establish VSOE of fair value, we then determine if we can establish TPE of fair value.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Our services differ significantly from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P28_S3	Therefore, we are typically unable to determine TPE.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P28_S4	If both VSOE and TPE do not exist, we use BESP to establish fair value and to allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	We determine BESP for a service by considering multiple factors including an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that service, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, and pricing practices.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Implementation revenue consists primarily of deferred professional services fees related to assisting customers with required implementation services, which include implementation, go-live and training support services.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	Historically, all of these fees are billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation was complete, and then, as the service does not have stand-alone value, it is recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	We evaluate the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on our experience with customer contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those customers will receive benefits from our current portfolio of services.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	During 2014, we began to sell go-live and training support services separate from the required implementation services.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	Go-live and training support services can be purchased by the customer from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, have stand alone value and are recognized upon delivery of service.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P31_S3	Previously deferred revenue balances related to implementation services that were billed up front and did not have stand alone value, will continue to be amortized over those remaining customer lives.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P31_S4	Also, in 2014, we began to include the fees associated with the required implementation services in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, they are being recognized ratably over the customer life.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P31_S5	Certain expenses related to the implementation go-live and training of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P31_S6	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Direct Operating Expense Direct operating expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) related to personnel who provide services, including implementation go-live and training of clients, and claim processing costs.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	We expense these costs as incurred.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P32_S2	We include in direct operating expense all service costs incurred to fulfill our customer contracts.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P32_S3	Direct operating expense also includes costs associated with third-party tenant and other non-core revenue.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P32_S4	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, or amortization, except for amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P32_S5	Research and Development Expense Research and development expense consists primarily of compensation expense for research and development employees (including stock-based compensation) and consulting fees for third-party developers.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P32_S7	Research and development expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, or amortization.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, and share-based awards with compensation cost measured using the fair value of the awards issued.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value share-based awards and determine the related compensation expense.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P33_S2	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	We generally issue previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options; however, we may reissue previously acquired treasury shares to satisfy these awards in the future.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Certain employees have received grants for which the ultimate number of shares that will be subject to vesting is dependent upon the achievement of certain financial targets for the year.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	Such determination is not made until the grant s vesting determination date, which is the date our fiscal year financial statements are available.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	The grant is initially recorded at the maximum attainable number of shares that is most likely to be subject to vesting based on available financial forecasts as of the date of grant.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	This amount is adjusted on a quarterly basis as new financial forecasts become available.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	Stock based compensation expense for these grants is recorded over the requisite service period, generally four years.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P36_S3	Such options generally vest ratably over four years from the vesting determination date.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Advertising Expenses Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	Advertising expense totaled $15.5 million , $14.2 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity from the Company s date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	Restricted Cash As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , restricted cash balances totaled $0.0 million and $3.0 million , respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	The December 31, 2013 balance consists of escrowed funds held as a deposit associated with a possible pending lease.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P38_S3	The amount was returned to us when the lease was signed in January 2014.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Investments Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase based upon management s intent with regard to such investments.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	All investments, except for certain investments in privately-held companies which are accounted for at cost, are held as available-for-sale investments.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Scheduled maturity dates of U.S. government-backed securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper purchased that are within one year are classified as short-term.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company determines realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be, and are recorded at fair value.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	The remaining financial instruments' carrying values approximate their fair value, primarily because of their short-term nature.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Derivative financial instruments are used to manage certain of the Company s interest rate exposures.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	Derivatives are carried at fair value, as determined using standard valuation models, and adjusted when necessary for credit risk.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	Refer to Note 4 Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 9 Debt for additional information.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, and accounts receivable.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	With respect to customer accounts receivable, we manage our credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its customers.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	No single customer accounted for a significant portion of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1131096_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represents amounts due from customers for business services.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts, which is determined by establishing reserves for specific accounts and consideration of historical and estimated probable losses.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P48_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Equipment, furniture, and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from three to five years.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the applicable lease terms, excluding renewal periods.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	Buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over 30 to 40 years.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P51_S2	Building improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over 10 to 25 years.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P51_S3	Aircraft and land improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over 20 years and 10 years, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P51_S4	Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P51_S5	Capitalized Interest Cost Interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically the Company s corporate headquarters campus project and capitalized internal-use software development costs, are capitalized until the underlying asset is placed into service.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the effective interest rate of the outstanding debt by the qualifying costs.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	As the qualifying asset is placed into service, the qualifying asset and the related capitalized interest are amortized over the useful life of the related asset.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	We capitalize costs related to athenaNet services and certain other projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage, including stock-based compensation expense for employees working on these projects.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	The estimated useful life of the software is two to three years.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P54_S2	Amortization expense was $33.2 million , $18.0 million , and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 , respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P54_S3	Future amortization expense for all software development costs capitalized as of December 31, 2014 is estimated to be $34.6 million , $17.4 million and $2.7 million for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P54_S4	In addition to the future amortization expenses, we have a $1.7 million balance in a capitalization in progress account related to software development costs.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the asset carrying value.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P56_S2	Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P56_S3	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 .
1131096_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	Purchased Intangible Assets Purchased intangible assets consist of technology, a physician network, content, a trade name, customer backlog, non-compete agreements and customer relationships acquired in connection with business acquisitions and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of economic benefit expected from each asset.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	We concluded for certain purchased intangible assets that the pattern of economic benefit approximated the straight-line method, and therefore, the use of the straight-line method was appropriate, as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	Accrued expenses and accrued compensation Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of rent escalation, tenant improvement allowances and other incentives received from landlords related to the operating leases for our facilities.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	Rent escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which we record over the term of the lease.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P64_S2	The excess is recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord or paid on our behalf as part of the negotiated terms of the lease.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	These cash payments are recorded as deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense, over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	Deferred revenue includes amounts associated with multiple element arrangements associated with sponsored clinical information and decision support services which is recognized based upon contractual deliverables, and previously deferred implementation services fees which will continue to be recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the estimated expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P66_S2	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	We apply business combination accounting when we have acquired control over one or more businesses.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	Business combinations are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P67_S2	The associated acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; non-controlling interests are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed rather than capitalized; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will affect income tax expense; and goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	The results of the acquired businesses operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the combined entity beginning on the date of acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	We have applied this acquisition method to the transactions described in Note 2.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	Related Party Transaction During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we made a long-term investment in a vendor.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P69_S4	The total expense related to this vendor for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $11.3 million and $1.5 million , respectively, and the total amount payable related to this vendor at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $1.3 million and $0.4 million , respectively.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S2	In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S3	We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S4	Our income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the balance sheet date to be recognized in the related period.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S5	Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S6	From time to time, we receive incentives from various government agencies and programs.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S7	We account for the portion of the credits that are expected to be used to reduce non-income taxes as a grant.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P70_S8	Credits which are expected to be used to reduce non-income taxes are recognized when the requirements to earn the credits have been met.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	Sales and Use Taxes Our services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	Our contractual agreements with customers provide that payment of any sales or use tax assessments are the responsibility of the customer.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	In certain jurisdictions, sales taxes are collected from the customer and remitted to the respective agencies.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	These taxes are recorded on a net basis and excluded from revenue and expense in our financial statements as presented.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiary are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P73_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P73_S3	Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded within other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1131096_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	In addition, the ASU provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including, but not limited to, when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	ASU 2014-09 provides companies with two implementation methods.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	Companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application).
1131096_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	We are currently in the process of evaluating this new guidance.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P75_S3	This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	ACQUISITIONS Watertown, MA Corporate Headquarters Arsenal on the Charles On May 10, 2013, athenahealth, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Athena Arsenal, LLC, completed the acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles, located in Watertown, Massachusetts.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Arsenal on the Charles is an expansive 29 -acre, multi-building, commercial property where we were leasing space for our headquarters and related operating activities prior to the transaction.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P76_S2	The purpose of this acquisition was to allow for future expansion of the corporate headquarters to accommodate anticipated headcount growth.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P76_S3	The purchase price was $168.5 million , which was based on management s estimates and assumptions based on the information that was available as of the date of the acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P76_S4	The fair value of the consideration paid was $167.3 million , all of which was paid in cash.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management s estimates and assumptions and were based on the information that was available as of the date of the acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	Certain items, such as the working capital adjustments to the purchase price, were subject to change as additional information was received about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P78_S2	During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we finalized this valuation.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The following table sets forth the fair value of the components of the identifiable intangible assets acquired by asset class:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	The value of any in-place lease is estimated to be equal to the property owners avoidance of costs necessary to re-lease the property for a lease term equal to the remaining primary in-place lease term and the value of investment grade tenancy.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	The cost avoidance to the property owners of vacancy/leasing costs necessary to lease the property for a lease term equal to the remaining in-place lease term is derived first by determining the in-place lease term on the subject lease.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P80_S2	Then, based on our review of the market, the cost to be borne by a property owner to replicate a market lease to the remaining in-place term was estimated.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P80_S3	These costs consist of: (i) rent lost during downtime (e.g., assumed periods of vacancy), (ii) estimated expenses that would be incurred by the property owner during periods of vacancy, (iii) rent concessions (e.g., free rent), (iv) leasing commissions, and (v) tenant improvement allowances.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P80_S4	We determined these values using our own estimates along with third-party appraisals.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	We amortize the capitalized value of in-place lease intangible assets to expense over the remaining initial term of each lease.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	We amortize the capitalized value of above market leases to expense over the initial and expected renewal terms of the leases.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	No amortization period for intangible assets will exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P81_S3	The amounts of third-party tenant revenue (included in the line item Implementation and other ) and net (loss) from the Arsenal on the Charles included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from the acquisition date of May 10, 2013 through the periods ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 are as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	Direct operating expense from the acquisition date of May 10, 2013, through the period ended December 31, 2013 and the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 , includes $9.1 million and $13.6 million of costs associated with third-party tenant revenue for the Arsenal on the Charles.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P82_S1	We incurred transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, and $3.1 million in total.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P82_S2	These costs are included in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	On March 12, 2013, we acquired Epocrates, a leading provider of essential clinical content, practice tools, and health industry engagement via mobile devices at the point of care.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	synergies, and accelerated awareness of athenahealth s services across the physician market and to deliver high-value information to the clinical community.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for Epocrates, less cash and short-term investments acquired, was approximately $237.6 million , which consisted of the following:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	The value of the share consideration for Epocrates common stock was based on the average closing sales prices per share of athenahealth common stock for the ten trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the closing of the acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The fair value of the stock options and restricted stock units assumed by us was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	The share conversion ratio of 0.1239 was applied to convert Epocrates stock options and restricted stock units to athenahealth stock options and restricted stock units.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P87_S2	We assumed stock options and restricted stock units with a fair value of $22.6 million .
1131096_15_ITEM15_P87_S3	Of the total consideration, $13.0 million was allocated to the purchase consideration and $9.6 million was allocated to future services and is being expensed on a straight-line basis over the remaining service periods.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management s estimates and assumptions based on the information that was available as of the date of the acquisition.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	The fair values of certain items, such as accounts receivable, purchased intangible assets, current and non-current income taxes payable, deferred taxes, deferred revenue and uncertain tax benefits, were subject to change as additional information was received about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition and as certain tax returns were finalized.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	The fair values were finalized during the quarter ended December 31, 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	The physician network represents the fair values of the underlying relationships and agreements with Epocrates customers and the fair values of the savings associated with future marketing spend for the athenahealth services to the acquired physician network.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	All of the purchased intangible assets related to the Epocrates transaction have finite lives.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	For those purchased intangible assets where an income approach was used, we considered the projected undiscounted cash flows as the best indication of the pattern of economic benefit expected from each asset.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities when integrating Epocrates mobile device platform with the athenahealth service offerings.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	The goodwill balance is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P93_S2	The amounts of revenue and net income (loss) of Epocrates included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from the acquisition date of March 12, 2013 through the period ended December 31, 2013 and for the period ended December 31, 2014 are as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	(a) As we have fully integrated our operations, it is impracticable for us to disclose the net income (loss) associated with the acquired business for the year ended December 31, 2014 The net loss for the period ended December 31, 2013 includes $7.9 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the acceleration of certain individuals stock awards upon termination.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P94_S2	These costs are included in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	As part of the integration of Epocrates, we communicated to certain employees severance and retention bonuses which were expensed during 2013.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	If the employee did not fulfill the required employment period for the retention bonus, the amount was not paid and the expense was reversed.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P95_S2	The following table summarizes these amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The following pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for athenahealth as though the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles occurred on January 1, 2012.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	The unaudited pro forma financial information is as follows:
1131096_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	The pro forma financial information for all periods presented has been calculated after adjusting the results of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles to reflect the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions including the amortization expenses from acquired intangible assets, the depreciation expenses from acquired tangible assets, the stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock options and restricted stock units assumed, and the related tax effects as though the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2012.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P97_S1	The pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	Basic net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P98_S2	Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, and shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P98_S3	Under the treasury stock method, dilutive securities are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the periods and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P98_S4	Securities are excluded from the computations of diluted net (loss) income per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 0.4 million and 0.4 million of stock options and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , respectively, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their estimated fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P100_S2	These carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their variable rate nature at current market rates.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	During 2014, we launched our MDP Accelerator portfolio, a program designed to cultivate heath care information technology start-ups and expand services offered to our physician network.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	Our investment totals $0.8 million short-term convertible note receivable, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P101_S2	At December 31, 2014 , as there is no indication of performance risk and no conversion is currently contemplated, we estimate that the fair value of this note receivable approximates cost, based on inputs including the original transaction price, our own recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment, subsequent rounds of financing and changes in financial ratios or cash flows (Level 3).
1131096_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	Marketable equity securities and money market funds are valued using a market approach based upon the quoted market prices of identical instruments when available or other observable inputs such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets or similar securities.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	It is our policy to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period; however, there have been no such transfers during any periods presented.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	As a result of the IPO, we classified this investment as available-for-sale and marked-to-market the shares we hold based on quoted market prices.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	Our interest rate swap agreement was designed to manage exposure to interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	We have designated the interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P105_S2	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) until the hedged items are recognized in earnings.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P105_S3	Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, associated with the interest rate swap will be reported in interest expense.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , no amount was recognized in earnings for our interest rate swap.

1131096_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2014 will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	This amount will vary due to fluctuations in interest rates.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the swap counterparty.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	The estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreement with a certain financial institution at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was a liability of $0.2 million and $0.4 million , respectively, based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the interest rate swap (Level 2).

1131096_15_ITEM15_P109_S1	In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities obtained from readily available pricing sources for similar instruments.
1131096_15_ITEM15_P109_S2	The fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable values which are supported by little or no market activity.

1131096_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	athenahealth is a leading provider of cloud-based services and mobile applications for medical groups and health systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our mission is to be health care providers most trusted service, helping them do well by doing the right thing.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	We deliver cloud-based services for revenue cycle and practice management, electronic health records ( EHR ), patient engagement, patient access, care coordination, order transmission, population health management, and clinical decision support.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	Through these services, we connect health care information and processes across the continuum of care and drive meaningful, measurable results for more than 75,000 health care providers nationwide.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our model combines a cloud-based network, knowledge, and back-office work, which we refer to as network, knowledge and work, to help keep health care providers profitable and prepared for every change.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	In most cases, we charge clients a percentage of collections for our services, aligning our financial results directly with those of our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	In 2015, we generated revenue of $924.7 million primarily from the sale of our services, compared to $752.6 million in 2014 and $595.0 million in 2013.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on August 21, 1997, as Athena Healthcare Incorporated.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	We changed our name to athenahealth.com, Inc. on March 31, 2000, and to athenahealth, Inc. on November 17, 2000.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	We believe our market opportunity is massive and growing.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P2_S4	Our services have historically been focused on the ambulatory health care market.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P2_S5	Following our acquisition and integration in 2015 of Razor Insights, LLC, a provider of cloud-based billing and EHR software services to rural and community hospitals, we entered into the acute care market.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P2_S6	As we begin to support the full continuum of care, our market opportunity may grow.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	The health care industry is complex, disconnected, and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that may not be able to support the current needs for collaboration, flexibility, and interoperability.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	A disproportionate amount of communication still takes place on paper instead of via automated communications.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Outdated, inflexible systems, and paper workflows create significant costs for health care organizations, which suffer from substantial administrative work, duplicated efforts, and errors.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	The complex business of health care is becoming increasingly more reliant on interoperability the easy, open flow of clinical and financial information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Whether health systems and medical groups are moving rapidly or slowly towards value-based reimbursement, the success of health systems and medical groups increasingly hinges on their ability to engage patient populations and to coordinate patient care across a multitude of settings, while optimizing efficiency along the way.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	By allowing athenahealth to address these problems, health care providers can focus on the practice of medicine and free their staff to spend time on higher-value tasks.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	The activities required to ensure appropriate payment for health care services rendered have increased in number and complexity for the following reasons:
1131096_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Legislative and regulatory reform efforts .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Legislative reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), has been driving fundamental shifts in the health care reimbursement landscape.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	For example, as part of the ACA millions of people have been required to purchase health insurance coverage.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, the passage of the Medicare Access and Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) Reauthorization Act of 2015 ( MACRA ) represents a significant upcoming shift in payment and delivery models and codifies the transition from volume-based reimbursement to value-based payments.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	Also, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) rule adopts the International Classification of Diseases 10 th Revision ( ICD-10 ) code set for diagnoses and procedures, which represents a more complex and detailed reporting scheme that requires claims to be filed with ICD-10 codes in order to be processed and paid.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	ICD-10 went into effect in the United States on October 1, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Health insurers have introduced a wide range of benefit structures, many of which are customized to the unique goals of particular employer groups.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Such insurers also continually update their reimbursement rules based on ongoing monitoring of consumption patterns, in response to new medical products and procedures, and to address changing employer demands.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	This has resulted in an increase in the number of rules regarding who is eligible for health care services, what health care services are eligible for reimbursement, and who is responsible to pay for health care services delivered.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	It has also resulted in more plans that require a larger proportion of patient contribution for services delivered; these dynamics increase the burden on health systems and medical groups to manage and pursue receivables directly with the patient.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Health systems and medical groups need to be continually aware of the diversity and dynamic nature of health benefit plan design.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	While the fee-for-service framework can be complicated enough, rapidly emerging outcome-based payment models are even more complex, requiring health care providers to capture and provide appropriate data to obtain payments.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Accountable care programs also require a much greater focus on care coordination and cost efficiency across multiple health care providers.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	To complicate reimbursement even further, some models, such as Pay-For-Performance, demand that health care providers first identify programs for which they are eligible, and then enroll in programs, identify eligible patients, and record relevant billing and clinical data for each eligible encounter.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	These newer models continue to evolve and grow in both number and complexity.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Financial incentives for the use of EHRs .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	The federal government enacted a financial incentive program through the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act ) for health care providers who demonstrate Meaningful Use of a certified EHR technology.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	While payments under the program do not represent a sustained market opportunity, they have shifted buying patterns since they were instituted, with many health care providers accelerating their purchase of EHRs and making revenue cycle system decisions tied to an EHR selection and their ability to demonstrate "Meaningful Use".
1131096_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	In addition to administering typical business functions, health care providers must dedicate significant time and resources to physician orders, including referrals to specialists, imaging centers, laboratories, pharmacies, and inpatient admissions.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	This requires a series of communications to ensure the care is appropriate and eligible for reimbursement.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	challenged with having to contact patients, payers, and other trading partners to effectively exchange the right information to accompany clinical orders.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our mission is to be health care providers most trusted service, helping them do well by doing the right thing.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	In almost all cases, we price our services as a percentage of collections, a strategy that incentivizes us to improve performance and reduce costs through more efficient operations.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	As medical groups and health systems face rising costs and complexity, they need solutions for a diverse set of problems, including the ever increasing administrative work driven by that increased complexity, new, more complicated reimbursement models, partners demand for electronic data exchange, pressure to adopt expensive EHRs, continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards, new payer rules, and the challenges of collecting payments from uninsured, underinsured, and high deductible health plan patients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	Health care providers and practices also face time-consuming administrative challenges, such as processing and sorting a practice s incoming paper documents; identifying and managing payer rules; and having a live operator take patient phone calls after a practice closes for the day.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	We believe the traditional software model fails to address these needs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P13_S5	Conventional software does not allow for rapid, intelligent evolution of system functionality and client needs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P13_S6	Additionally, locally-installed software favors larger organizations that can afford a sizable upfront investment in hardware and software, plus the staff to manage and maintain these systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	With the traditional software model, the client is still responsible for all of the back-office work from managing claims to handling time-consuming clinical paperwork.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	In contrast, cloud-based software can solve a greater set of problems because it can quickly be updated and delivered to all clients as a single, shared instance of software without expensive installations or upgrades.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	The ability to perform administrative back-office services is also greatly facilitated by cloud-based software.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	Combining these back-office services, and many more, to our cloud-based network, is the crux of our services model.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S4	As our cloud-based software delivers the right knowledge to the right person at the right time, our back-office services execute work, at scale, that would otherwise fall upon the practice.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S5	The connectivity and system infrastructure we provide would normally be unattainable for small independent practices, which make up a large portion of the health care provider market.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S6	However, because we automate processes and scale work across our entire provider network, we can efficiently deliver our services to medical practices of every size.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S7	By giving small practices the same technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefits not only to those practices, but also to their clinical exchange and trading partners with whom they share vital information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S8	As practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility enhances our ability to compete, regardless of whether a practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P14_S9	Key elements of our strategic priorities include:
1131096_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Fully leverage the power of our network .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our ability to leverage the power of our network, which includes over 75,000 providers and over 38 million patients, is one of our greatest differentiators.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Through our network, we have the ability to connect doctors to other doctors, to payers, and to patients, and we will continue to find ways to monetize the network effects inherent in our platform.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Continue our expansion across the continuum of care .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our vision is to build a unified clinical experience that allows providers to cross environments (inpatient, outpatient, etc.) without having to log in to different systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	We aim to present a single clinical and financial record, integrating information for the user from any system on which information resides.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	We have made rapid progress in less than a year on our expansion into delivering services to hospitals and health systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	We will continue to expand our service offerings organically, through acquisitions, and through integration with our More Disruption Please ("MDP") partners solutions, to provide solutions for new modalities across every setting of care.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Equip providers to win at alternative reimbursement .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We will continue to orient our services to enable clients to participate in pay-for-reporting, pay-for-performance, shared savings, and other bonus payment programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	We will also establish new engagement points to connect with patients, as this stakeholder group will become an increasingly important part of such payment programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Configure our organization to enable greater scaling efficiencies .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	We will continuously refine our organizational structure to align with the objectives of achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness in execution.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	We will find ways to further streamline our business, including, for example, the ways in which we run product demonstrations, manage client onboarding and surface meaningful analysis in our clients' work flows, in an effort to create a better experience for our clients and reduce costs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	By combining three distinct but interconnected components network, knowledge, and work we empower our clients to achieve and sustain financial health while staying focused on quality patient care.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	We deliver the majority of our service offerings using a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	Including our clients on the same instance of software creates a network effect.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	We believe that this network effect enables each client to benefit from the collective experience of other clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	As the network grows, we believe these benefits also expand.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	athenaNet acts as a conduit for the exchange of information among clients, payers, trading partners, and our staff of experts.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	It enables us to learn continuously, innovate with agility, and deliver near-instant updates that rapidly improve performance.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	In addition, our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	This work ranges from receiving, scanning, and delivering faxes to tracking claims with payers and managing denials.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S4	We automate this work whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work at massive scale with our teams of experts.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S5	The knowledge we gain from doing work for our clients and discovering ways to improve their performance is culled, curated, and captured within athenaNet through mechanisms that include a patented billing rules engine and clinical quality management engine.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S6	As we work with clients, payers, and other industry trading partners, more expert knowledge is infused into each service, which we believe makes athenaNet smarter and more powerful for our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P21_S7	This unique combination of network, knowledge, and work is fundamental to our service model and value proposition to clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We also provide clients in the health care industry ( e.g. , pharmaceutical companies, managed care companies, and market research firms) the opportunity to sponsor clinical decision support services in order to engage with our Epocrates member network and offer the sale of subscriptions to Epocrates premium drug and clinical reference tools to health care professionals.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	We have developed a number of cloud-based services.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	We offer various combinations of our services to our clients, depending on whether they are medical groups and practices or hospitals and larger health systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	A description of each service component follows the table below.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	The foundation of athenahealth s service portfolio is athenaCollector, its cloud-based revenue cycle and practice management service, which became generally available in 2000.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Through this service, athenahealth helps to reduce administrative work and enables clients to improve performance and efficiency under reimbursement models, including Pay-for-Performance.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	athenaCollector helps clients improve revenue cycle management by checking patient eligibility prior to appointments, tracking practice activity in real-time and providing a workflow dashboard, as well as performance reporting tools including benchmarks, against other clients on athenaNet.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	This service helps clients maintain compliance with billing and claims management standards through a patented billing rules engine.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	athenaCollector also helps clients improve practice management by simplifying workflows related to patient registration, scheduling, check-in, charge entry, referral management, check-out, follow-up, collections, accounting and reporting.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P25_S3	It eliminates or reduces many time-consuming activities that typically burden our clients and their staff, allowing them to focus more on patient care and other business priorities.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	The patented billing rules engine that powers athenaCollector represents the industry s largest database of payer-specific reimbursement requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	It delivers in-depth insight and knowledge that helps clients collect the dollars they have earned.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our rules engine is updated daily based on information amassed through the collective experience of thousands of clients across the nation and through our research on the complex, evolving requirements of hundreds of payers and thousands of benefit plans.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	Clients route their day-to-day electronic and paper-based payer claims to us before they go to payers, which we then process using our patented billing rules engine to avoid denials and reimbursement delays and improve practice performance.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	When denials do occur, our teams of experts work to understand them and add new rules to the engine that help our entire client base avoid future denials.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our back-office services team partners with clients at all key steps in the revenue cycle, including: coordinating with payers to ensure that providers are properly set up for billing; submitting claims to payers directly or through intermediaries; obtaining confirmation of claim receipt from payers; receiving and processing checks and remittance information from payers and documenting the result of payers responses; evaluating denied claims and determining the best approach to appealing or re-submitting claims to obtain payment; billing patients for balances that are due; compiling and delivering management reporting about the performance of clients at both the account level and the provider level; transmitting key clinical data to the revenue cycle workflow to eliminate the need for code re-entry and to permit assembly of all key data elements required to achieve maximum appropriate reimbursement; and providing proactive and responsive client support to manage issues, address questions, identify training needs, and communicate trends.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	athenaCollector is offered as a stand-alone solution for revenue cycle and practice management; athenaCollector for Hospitals and Health Systems is offered as a stand-alone revenue cycle solution for hospital clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	In addition, our revenue cycle services are integrated with more comprehensive offerings: athenaOne and athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Certain legacy clients may purchase advanced analytical and reporting tools to supplement the native athenaCollector reporting suite.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	These additional tools were previously offered separately as athenaCoordinator Analytics, but that service is no longer offered on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	athenahealth s cloud-based EHR service is known as athenaClinicals.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	athenaClinicals is designed to make the documentation and exchange of health information easier by centering the workflow around the patient visit.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	This service encourages delegation by intelligently surfacing relevant clinical content based on physician behavior across the network, and helps with tedious administrative work associated with managing orders and results.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	It entered general availability in 2006 and was made available as a stand-alone service in 2010.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	athenaClinicals addresses the core clinical workflows of a practice including: a clinical facesheet; encounter documentation; order entry; results viewing; patient call tracking; clinical reminder tracking; and workflow task management.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	athenaClinicals displays key clinical measures related to the drivers of high-quality, efficient care delivery, lab results requiring review, patient referral requests, prescription requests, patient histories, and summaries of previous exams documented using athenaClinicals.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our cloud-based platform features robust clinical reporting and enables health information exchange so patients can smoothly transition across care settings, which is further enabled by the network effect of athenaNet.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our unique, powerful quality management engine is continuously updated with clinical guidelines and rules.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	As reporting and quality programs have collectively become a greater portion of physician revenue, clinical data must be captured according to the requirements and incentives of different payers and plans.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our quality management engine is designed to: identify the specific clinical activities required to meet Pay-for-Performance and outcome-based programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid Meaningful Use and Physician Quality Reporting System, programs, access medication formularies, and identify potential medication errors (such as drug-to-drug interactions or drug-allergy reactions).
1131096_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	In an effort to drive continuous improvement, our quality management team proactively monitors client performance throughout the year, compares it to national benchmarks, and recommends ways to optimize our clients performance based on clinical workflow best practices and our analysis of thousands of providers across the network.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Health systems and medical groups that use an EHR can still receive a substantial number of paper clinical documents from third parties, creating a significant administrative burden.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our service operations team captures inbound paper documents, converts them to electronic format, attaches them to the appropriate patient chart, classifies them according to type, and associates results with the original order where applicable.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	Additionally, even if the provider creates an order in the EHR, the intended recipient may not accept orders electronically; in that case, our service operations team converts the electronically generated order to paper for delivery on the client s behalf.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	We also perform many of the Pay-for-Performance program identification and enrollment tasks on behalf of clients so they can participate without significant upfront research and effort.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	In addition, we have worked with the National Committee for Quality Assurance, to have our services approved for automatic credit scores that are transferable to eligible client practices submitting for Patient-Centered Medical Home recognition.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	athenahealth also offers an EHR service to clients who provide care in the acute care setting athenaClinicals for Hospitals and Health Systems which transforms the core athenaClinicals services so that they are appropriate for the additional requirements of a non-ambulatory setting.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	Both athenaClinicals and athenaClinicals for Hospitals and Health Systems are also offered as part of comprehensive solutions: athenaOne and athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	athenahealth s cloud-based patient engagement and communication service, known as athenaCommunicator, entered general availability in 2010 and continues to help providers deepen their relationships with their patients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	This service offers a unique approach to patient communication by combining a web-based automated messaging platform and patient portal with the ability to speak to live operators for patients who receive specific call types.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	The automated messaging platform delivers phone calls, SMS messages, and e-mails to patients, including appointment reminders, past due balance alerts, disease management initiatives, secure test results, and other compliance-driven campaigns.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	Our patient portal enables patients to express communication preferences, view lab results, review appointment information, exchange secure messages with providers, update personal information, and pay bills.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P38_S4	Clients who also use athenaClinicals can choose to allow their patients to view specific portions of their medical record via the patient portal.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	athenaCommunicator enables clients to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	They can set patient or group-specific communication preferences that will automatically tailor communications to the preferred timing and mode of delivery, including phone call, SMS message, e-mail, or patient portal.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	Additionally, we print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of the client to assist with patient payment collection.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	Collectively, these activities expand the availability of the medical practice to patients and help alleviate the burden of administrative communications, freeing staff to focus on more critical tasks.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	athenaCoordinator is athenahealth s EHR-agnostic, cloud-based order transmission service, which entered general availability in 2012.

1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	In response to changes in the market, and to better serve medical groups and health systems, our research and development efforts focus on enhancing our service offerings.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	All of our clients use the same version of athenaNet, with some rules designed to take effect locally for particular clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	We continually update our software and rules, and execute frequent, periodic releases of new software functionality for our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S5	Our software development life cycle methodology ensures that each software release is properly designed, built, tested, and rolled out.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S6	Our software development technologists are primarily located in the United States; we complement this team s work with software development services from third-party technology development providers, as well as our own employees at our development center operated through our subsidiaries in India.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S7	In addition to our core software development activities, we dedicate full-time staff to our ongoing development and maintenance of our rules database.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S8	We also employ program management and product management personnel, who work continually on improvements to our service operations processes and our service design, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S9	Our operations team assists clients at each critical step in the revenue, clinical, patient engagement, and care coordination workflow, and provides services that include insurance benefits packaging, insurance eligibility confirmation, claims submission, claims tracking, remittance posting, denials management, payment processing, formatting and submission of lab requisitions, and monitoring and classification of all inbound faxes.

1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S11	We depend on satisfied clients to succeed, and have aligned our financial goals with that of our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S12	Our client contracts require minimum commitments by us on a range of tasks, including claims submission, payment posting, claims tracking, and claims denial management.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P51_S13	We also make a commitment to our clients that athenaNet will be accessible 99.7% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Each quarter, our management conducts a survey of clients to identify client concerns and track progress against client satisfaction objectives.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	In our most recent survey, our net promoter score was 40.7.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	The net promoter score is the percentage of clients who chose 9 or 10 (defined as promoters) less the percentage of clients who chose 0 through 6 (defined as detractors) on a scale of 1 to 10 when asked if they would recommend our services to a trusted friend or colleague.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	In addition to the services described above, we also provide client support services, including:
1131096_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	active, real-time performance monitoring for clients with complex and highly-scaled operations.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Sales and Marketing We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of health care providers, medical groups, and health systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	We expect to expand our network by selling our complete suite of services to new clients and cross-selling additional services into our existing client base.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is divided into four groups for sales of athenahealth-branded services: the enterprise team, which is dedicated to serving the very largest managed care organizations, as well as those with high growth potential; the group team, which is dedicated to medical practices with seven to 150 physicians; the small group team, which is dedicated to practices with one to six physicians; and the hospital team, which is dedicated to hospitals and hospital-owned clinics and medical groups with 50 beds or less.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	We also have sales teams dedicated to sales of our Epocrates-branded services for pharmaceutical and other institutional clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S6	Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients, we conduct a consultative sales process, which includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S7	In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S8	We refer to these third parties as channels and the individuals and organizations involved as our channel partners.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S9	In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for providing us sales lead information that results in sales.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S10	These channel partners typically do not make direct sales.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S11	Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as an independent sales representative, a purchasing agent (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or a joint marketer of combined service offerings that we jointly develop with that third party.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S12	In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S13	Our channel relationships include our clients, state medical societies, health care information technology product companies, health care product distribution companies, consulting firms, group purchasing organizations, health systems, regional extension centers, and payers.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S14	Our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so they will view our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S15	To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P55_S16	In addition, we use the Epocrates member network as a lead-generation platform for selling our athenahealth-branded services.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our marketing and awareness initiatives are generally targeted toward specific segments of the health care market.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Competition We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition in the marketplace.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our primary competition uses locally-installed software to manage the various clinical and financial workflow needs within the medical group or health system.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	Other nationwide competitors offer services they refer to as on-demand or software-as-a-service models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Epic Systems Corporation; Greenway Health, LLC; McKesson Corp.; NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC; Optum, Inc.; Practice Fusion, Inc.; Quality Systems, Inc.; and SCI Solutions, Inc.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
1131096_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	However, some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with health care providers.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	As a result, these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	These companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, patent prosecution and litigation, and to finance capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P60_S4	Our Epocrates-branded services compete for users of the types of clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P60_S5	Competitors providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	The primary competition for pharmaceutical promotional spend comes from companies, such as WebMD, that offer other marketing channels to health care professionals.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	We compete primarily on our ability to reach and communicate with health care professionals under the Epocrates brand, which is recognized and endorsed among health care professionals as a trusted and accurate source of drug and clinical information; the breadth and loyalty of this large and active network is not easily replicated, and it enhances our ability to market our sponsored services.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the services we provide are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws, including regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) of the HHS, as well as additional regulation.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Government Regulation of Health Information HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it (collectively, HIPAA ) contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	These are embodied in the Privacy Rule and Security Rule portions of HIPAA.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules apply directly to covered entities, such as health care providers who engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from the HIPAA-prescribed electronic forms and other forms, we are a covered entity in our capacity as a clearinghouse.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S4	In other capacities where we create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information on behalf of our clients or other parties, we serve as a business associate.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S5	HIPAA generally requires the execution of business associate agreements to ensure that the business associate will appropriately safeguard protected health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S6	Our business associate agreements obligate us to provide adequate written assurances that we will properly safeguard the privacy and security of protected health information exchanged pursuant to each agreement.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S7	We also must enter into business associate agreements with entities who act as business associates for us, to clarify and limit the business associates' permissible uses of protected health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P64_S8	HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to health care billing must be conducted using prescribed electronic formats.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	requirements, and, moreover, we must structure and provide our services in a way that supports our clients HIPAA compliance obligations.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	HITECH Act and HIPAA Omnibus Rule .
1131096_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	The HITECH Act, the regulations issued under it, and the corresponding amendments to the HIPAA regulations in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, have altered and enhanced our obligations with respect to protected health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	In addition to HIPAA and the HITECH Act, most states have enacted laws related to the security of confidential medical information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and the HITECH Act, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Government Regulation of Reimbursement Our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those federal and state agencies that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	Given the breadth of these laws, they are potentially applicable to our business activities, including the transactions that we undertake on behalf of our clients and the financial arrangements through which we market, sell, and distribute our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	Accordingly, we are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government health care programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	During recent years, there have been numerous legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	It is possible that federal or state governments will implement future reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement under government programs that adversely affect our business, our client base, or our cost of providing our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Fraud and Abuse A number of federal and state laws prohibit a variety of activities that could result in excessive expenditure of funds on health care, such as the payment of kickbacks, fraudulent billing, and referrals for health care services where a conflict of interest exists.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	These laws, generally referred to as fraud and abuse laws, include, but are not limited to: Anti-Kickback Laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Courts have construed the federal Anti-Kickback Statute broadly to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal health care program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	There are several limited and narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	There are numerous federal and state criminal and civil laws that prohibit, among other things, the submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	In some cases, these laws also prohibit abuse in connection with such submission and payment, including, for example, by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing for the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	How these concepts apply to services such as ours that rely substantially on automated processes has not been well defined in the regulations or relevant case law, particularly since false or fraudulent claim laws often contain a knowledge qualifier.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P73_S3	Given the lack of legal authority on this issue, our errors with respect to the formatting, preparation, or transmission of claims, and certain mishandling by us of claims information that is supplied by our clients or other third parties, may be alleged, or determined to be, false claims under a false claims law.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	In addition to the provisions relating to health care access, financing, and delivery, the ACA made changes to health care fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	The ACA expands false claim laws, amends key provisions of other anti-fraud and abuse statutes, provides the government with new enforcement tools and funding for enforcement, and enhances both criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	The ACA may result in increased anti-fraud enforcement activities.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and health care entities.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Physicians are prohibited from referring patients for certain designated health services reimbursed under certain federal health care programs to entities with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, unless such referrals fall within a specific exception.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	Reimbursement claims that we submit for care rendered under prohibited referrals could potentially violate the Stark Law, or be deemed false or fraudulent, resulting in liability under the Stark Law or other fraud and abuse laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope and may not be limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government health care program.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	In many states, there are laws that prohibit non-licensed persons from practicing medicine, prevent corporations from employing licensed practitioners, and prohibit licensed medical practitioners from practicing medicine in collaboration with non-physicians, including business corporations.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	Some states also prohibit physicians from splitting their professional fees with non-physicians.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of the physician clients collections or charges.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P77_S3	There are also federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P77_S4	Some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P77_S5	In particular, the Medicare program specifically requires that billing agents who receive Medicare payments on behalf of health care providers must meet certain requirements, and the agent s compensation may not be related in any way to the amount billed or collected or the actual collection of payment.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P77_S6	Medicaid regulations similarly provide that Medicaid payments may be received by billing agents in the name of their clients without violating anti-assignment requirements if payment to the agent is related to the cost of the billing service, not related on a percentage basis to the amount billed or collected, and not dependent on collection of payment.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	Electronic Prescribing Laws States have differing prescription format and signature requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	Due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	In addition, effective on January 1, 2006, the HHS promulgated its final E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program regulations.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	These regulations, issued pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ( MMA ), consist of detailed standards and requirements, in addition to the HIPAA standards discussed previously, for prescription and other information transmitted electronically in connection with a drug benefit covered by the MMA s Prescription Drug Benefit.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P78_S4	These standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P78_S5	Aspects of our services are affected by such regulation, as our clients need to comply with these requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	To the extent states have specific legal requirements which include state approval of the systems used to transmit electronic prescriptions, athenaClinicals has been approved.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Anti-Tampering Laws For certain prescriptions that cannot or may not be transmitted electronically from physician to pharmacy, both federal and state laws require that the written forms used exhibit anti-tampering features.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	For example, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 require that most prescriptions covered by Medicaid must demonstrate security features that prevent copying, erasing, or counterfeiting of the written form.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	Because our clients will, on occasion, need to use printed forms, we must take these laws into consideration for purposes of the prescription functions of our athenaClinicals service.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Electronic Health Records Certification Requirements The HITECH Act directs the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ( ONCHIT ) to support and promote meaningful use of certified EHR technology nationwide through the adoption of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	In January 2011, HHS issued a final rule to establish a permanent certification program for EHR technology.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our athenaClinicals service has been certified as a 2014 Edition Complete EHR in accordance with the applicable certification criteria.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	United States Food and Drug Administration The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices and a proposed rule for reclassification of medical device data systems under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ( FDCA ).
1131096_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	The FDA has stated that health information technology software is a medical device under the FDCA, and we expect that the FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in health care settings regardless of whether the draft policy or proposed rule is finalized or changed.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	In April 2014, a draft report developed by the FDA was released proposing a regulatory framework for health information technology that promotes innovation, protects patient safety, and avoids regulatory duplication.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	If our computer software functionality is considered a medical device under the FDCA, we could be subject to additional regulatory requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	FDA regulations govern, among other things, product development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and import and export.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P85_S2	FDA requirements with respect to devices that are determined to pose lesser risk to the public include:
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecutions.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S2	Foreign Regulations Our subsidiary in Chennai, India, is subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S3	These regulations include Indian federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws, and qualification for tax status and tax incentives.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S4	We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S5	We have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S6	As of December 31, 2015 , we held fourteen U.S. patents and two foreign patents, with a number of U.S. patent applications and foreign patent applications pending.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S7	Our issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2020 and 2031.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S8	We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to protect our brand.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S9	We will continue to file and prosecute applications for patents and trademarks when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies and our brand.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P86_S10	While our patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe the following factors are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage:
1131096_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	a continued focus on the improved financial, operational, and clinical results of our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	We have a policy of requiring employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P88_S3	Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of health systems and medical groups and our clients in the pharmaceutical industry.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	Our pharmaceutical clients budgeting process impacts the timing of revenue related to sales of sponsored clinical information and decision support services, which has historically been highest in the fourth quarter.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P89_S3	In addition, as further explained in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2015 , we had 4,668 full-time employees, with 2,296 in service operations, 668 in sales and marketing, 1,280 in research and development, and 424 in general and administrative functions.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	Of these full-time employees, 3,973 were located in the U.S. and 695 were located in India.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
1131096_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.

1131096_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS GENERAL We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The provision by third parties of medical billing and practice management services to medical practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty, a limited set of payers, or a limited geographical area.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We anticipate that the software, statistical, and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	EHR and practice management software for health systems and medical groups has historically been dominated by large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these entities are now offering hosted services or a software-as-a-service model under which software is centrally administered, and these vendors may also provide administrative and billing services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The size, financial strength, and breadth of offerings of the larger entities are increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and health care industries.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect large integrated technology companies to continue to become more active in our markets, both through acquisition and internal investment.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, a few smaller companies have started providing single-instance, Internet-based software using a model similar to ours; the offerings of these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage of our services and impact our market share.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Further, while the market for patient engagement, population health and care coordination services is growing and is not as yet dominated by a small group of vendors with significant resources, our patient engagement, population health, and care coordination services face competition from a wide variety of market participants.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we fail to distinguish our patient engagement, population health, and care coordination offerings from the other options available to health care providers, the demand for and market share of those offerings may decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, we compete with other companies for users of the types of drug and clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from our pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We compete within a broad industry of health care content providers for the attention of health care professionals who can choose to use mobile, online or print media to reference clinical information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Companies providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Competition from each of these sources of clinical reference content may lead to a loss of our existing network members and a reduction in the rate at which we attract new members for our clinical information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our primary competition for the promotional spend available from our pharmaceutical clients in the area of interactive services is from companies, including WebMD, that help such companies market their products, programs, and services to health care professionals.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Our market research business competes with numerous companies that recruit physicians to participate in surveys in a variety of formats, as well as the recruitment arms of market research companies that have assembled their own survey panels of health care professionals.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S7	To the extent competing channels are available to access health care professionals, including physicians, the value of our interactive services to our clients is reduced.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Some of our current large competitors, such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Cerner Corporation; Epic Systems Corporation; McKesson Corp.; NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC; and Quality Systems, Inc., have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S9	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S10	We expect to face new competitors as we continue to develop and offer services for the inpatient market.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S11	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S12	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S13	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S14	Further, in light of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P4_S15	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition to new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target markets.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but that offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we are unable to retain existing members of our Epocrates network and attract new members, especially physician members with desired characteristics for our interactive services who actively participate in those services, our revenue will decline, the anticipated benefits of our Epocrates acquisition may not be realized, and our business will suffer.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Members of our Epocrates network who subscribe to our premium drug and clinical reference products usually do so for a term of one year and may elect to cancel the subscription for any renewal terms.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Under certain circumstances, our members may cancel their subscriptions prior to expiration.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Factors that may affect the retention rate of our existing members and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools include:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Unless we are able to provide current, relevant, and reliable health care content, drug and clinical reference tools, formulary hosting, and other services that meet and continue to meet the needs of health care professionals, including physicians, the value of those services to new and existing members will decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our provision of such services depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified physician and pharmacist editors and authors, license accurate and relevant content from third parties, contract with health plans and insurers to host formulary information, monitor and respond to changes in member interest in specific topics, and develop new or enhanced services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we cannot meet our staffing needs or develop or acquire needed content at a reasonable cost, if there are errors or omissions in such content, if our competitors obtain exclusive access to or develop content that health care professionals consider superior to ours, or if we cannot meet the needs of our members, the value of our content and services would diminish.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The reputation of our Epocrates brand is dependent in large part on the medical community s continued perception of us as independent from our health care industry clients, particularly pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If health care professionals believe that we are too closely associated with such clients as a result of the revenue we receive from their purchase or sponsorship of our interactive services, the credibility of our brand will diminish.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We cannot assure you that the medical community will view our content as sufficiently unbiased.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	reputation of our brand is damaged, it will be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to restore the quality of our brand with health care professionals and our business could suffer.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the developers of mobile operating systems and mobile devices with which our products and services are compatible fail to remain competitive in the marketplace and to be adopted into medical practice and practice workflow, members will be less inclined to use our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing products and services, including mobile, Web-based, and traditional products and services offered by competitors or through online resources and searches may affect our retention rate and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The availability of download sites such as the Apple App Store SM that offer numerous free or low-priced competing products at one location has also reduced the demand for our paid subscription products.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We expect the use of such sites to expand, reducing the number of paying members for our drug and clinical reference tools as a percentage of total members.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition to the loss of subscription revenue, our inability to attract or retain members, especially physician members with desired characteristics, such as specialty and prescribing habits, who update their mobile devices through our servers with sufficient frequency, may cause an even more significant decline in revenue from our interactive services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients are attracted to our large, engaged member network for the delivery of their clinical messages, formularies, and other sponsored content, and, without sufficient active members who meet desired criteria, those clients may reduce their subscription for our interactive services, and our revenue may decline.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Even if the number of our members is not materially reduced, their participation in our services may decrease, which could impact our revenues.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We have established limits on the number and the mix of sponsored and non-sponsored messages delivered to members in order to promote the quality of members experience with our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	If an insufficient number of members update during a given service period, or the demand for promotional clinical messaging sponsorship exceeds the available supply, our health care clients could become dissatisfied with our service.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S9	As a result, we may be unable to grow our interactive services revenue beyond the bounds we have set, as changes to such limits could cause our members to be dissatisfied with our services and the response to our interactive services to decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Furthermore, if our members generally become less responsive to participating in our services, the value of these interactive services will likely decline.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S11	This could cause our revenue to remain flat or to decline.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S12	Finally, if there is a reduction in the number of network members or their participation in our services, certain anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Epocrates, such as increased name recognition and reputation, cross-sell potential, and the market acceptance of joint services may not be fully realized, if at all.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S13	The market for cloud-based services for health care information technology may not develop substantially further or develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S14	The market for cloud-based services for health care information technology remains narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S15	Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of cloud-based services in general, and for their revenue, clinical, and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S16	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to a cloud-based service.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S17	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S18	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S19	Changes in the health care industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S20	As the health care industry evolves, changes in our member, client, and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S21	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of health care providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S22	Such larger health care organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S23	Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P9_S24	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	General reductions in expenditures by health care companies, or reductions in such expenditures within market segments that we serve, could have similar impacts with regard to our interactive services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Such reductions may result from, among other things, reduced governmental funding for health care; a decrease in the number of, or the market exclusivity available to, new drugs coming to market; government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which health care providers interact with patients, pharmaceutical companies, payers, or other health care industry participants ( e.g. , limitations on advertising to physicians or required disclosure of payments made to them); or adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting health care payers or providers, the pharmaceutical industry, or other health care companies that subscribe for our interactive services ( e.g. , changes in the design of health plans).
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Any of these changes could reduce the purchase of our services by such interactive services clients, reducing our revenue and possibly requiring us to materially revise our offerings.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, our interactive services clients expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to services of the types we provide.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to clients and users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client and user requirements, and sustain market acceptance.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients or users.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S7	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients and users will want, while offering these services at competitive prices.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S8	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may lose clients and users.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients and users, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S10	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S11	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P10_S12	Failure to manage our growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have been experiencing a period of strong growth.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We believe that increasing awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread adoption of our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Promotional activities may not generate an increase in awareness or revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building awareness.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Besides awareness, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Failure to manage our growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; reduce client or user satisfaction; limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources and management attention from other projects, such as the development of new or enhanced services or the acquisition of suitable businesses or technologies.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S10	We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as access and use restrictions and other contractual provisions, to protect these rights.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Our attempts to protect our intellectual property through copyright, patent, and trademark registration may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S12	We have fourteen issued U.S. patents, two issued foreign patents, and a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending as of December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P11_S13	The scope of our issued patents may be insufficient to prevent competitors from providing products and services similar to ours, our patents may be successfully challenged, and we may not be able to obtain additional meaningful patent protection in the future.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	performance of those agreements to the extent that it relates to the provision of our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, we require certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain of our vendors and strategic partners to agree to contract provisions regarding confidentiality and non-competition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	However, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Further, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in preventing the unauthorized access to, or use of, our proprietary information or the reverse engineering of our technology.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In any event, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technology or authoring clinical information that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or the information we distribute.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, our platforms incorporate open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	For example, some open source licenses require that those using the associated code disclose modifications made to that code and that such modifications be licensed to third parties at no cost.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	There can be no assurance that efforts we take to monitor the use of open source software to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use, and we could lose the right to use technologies that are the subject of such claims.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients, partners, and third-party service providers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Indemnification obligations of our partners and third-party service providers may not be effective or adequate to protect us or the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology or information to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services; or that we would not need to change our product and design plans, which could require us to redesign affected products or services or delay new offerings.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P18_S12	Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including government agencies, patients of our clients, or stockholders.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	This property is a former Superfund site, and our ownership of it, or any of our other properties, could expose us to liability under applicable environmental laws, as well as to liability as a landlord or as owner of property that may be used by members of the public.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS We depend upon third-party service providers for important functions of our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We have entered into service agreements with Dell Marketing L.P., a subsidiary of Dell, Inc., and Access Healthcare Services USA, LLC to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in India and the Philippines to support our client service operations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Among other things, these providers process critical claims data and clinical documents.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, we rely on our banking partner, U.S. Bank, for depositing client funds that we collect into our clients bank accounts.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	If such services fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation, and operating results could be harmed.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Failure of these service providers to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves, which increases our risk.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources, and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We depend on client satisfaction to succeed, both with respect to our cloud-based software and client support services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our sales organization is dependent on the quality of our service offerings, our business reputation, and strong recommendations from existing clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	If our cloud-based software does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert claims against us or terminate their contracts with us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or retain clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We provide client support services to resolve any issues related to our service offerings.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Our client support team may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support, particularly as we increase the size of our client base.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S9	It is difficult to predict client demand for support services and if client demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly-responsive client support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly-responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective clients, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S12	We conduct operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, unfavorable intellectual property protection, and pandemics.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P21_S14	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, client and user satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain clients and users, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In the foreign countries where we operate, local laws and customs may differ from those in the U.S.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For example, it may be a local custom in certain countries for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ).
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies from giving or offering money, gifts, or anything of value to a foreign official to obtain or retain business, and requires businesses to make and keep accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We cannot guarantee that our employees, contractors, and agents will comply with all of our FCPA compliance policies and procedures.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we or our employees, contractors, or agents fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, government authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and software engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, our search for replacements for departed employees may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, impact employee hiring and retention, and adversely impact our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P23_S7	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Volatility in the price of our stock or failure to obtain stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under our equity plans may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we acquire or invest in companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions or investments, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, in 2015, we acquired Razor Insights, LLC ( RazorInsights ), a provider of cloud-based billing and EHR software services to rural and community hospitals, and purchased a suite of internally-developed clinical applications and an EHR system from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to accelerate our entry into the inpatient market.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We may not successfully use the webOMR technology to accelerate the development of our service offerings and integrate RazorInsights service offerings and realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, additional amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, any of which could harm our financial condition, operating results, or value of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature in the short term, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower-than-expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer-than-expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S7	If the revenue of our clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Under most of our client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P27_S9	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	reimbursement programs such as Medicaid or initiatives under the ACA, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Also, although we currently estimate our expected customer life for clients of athenahealth-branded services to be twelve years, this is only an estimate, and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated on 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The majority of our clinical information subscriptions have terms of one year, and our contracts with our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients for our interactive services typically range from one to three years.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	We cannot assure you that members of our Epocrates network and other Epocrates-branded services clients will continue to participate in our existing programs beyond the terms of their existing contracts or that they will enter into any additional contracts for new programs that we offer.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	If our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S6	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S7	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P29_S8	A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete on pricing with other vendors, and otherwise harm our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe that our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, we voluntarily approach state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the states in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of, taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles for our athenahealth services, and the uncertainty as to the timing of the fulfillment of our Epocrates services, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The sales cycle for our athenahealth services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution, although this period can be substantially longer.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation, although some of our new-client set-up projects especially those for larger clients are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated customer life, currently 12 years, or the contract term.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Even if implementation has begun, there can be no assurance that we will recognize revenue on a timely basis or at all from our efforts.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Implementation for a given client may be canceled, as our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or no reason on 90 days notice.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, implementation may be delayed, or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future, for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	are extended, our provision of our athenahealth services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the canceled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, the time between the date of the signing of the contract with a pharmaceutical client for a program, the actual fulfillment of the services under such contract and the revenue recognition associated with such revenues may be lengthy, especially for larger contracts with multiple deliverables, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including those that result from that client s need for internal approvals.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	These factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Because we recognize revenue from our drug and clinical reference tool subscriptions and certain of our interactive services over the term or at the end of the service period, a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results, which may make it more difficult to evaluate our prospects.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We recognize revenue from our Epocrates subscription agreements monthly over the terms of these agreements, which are typically one year.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S7	In most cases, we recognize revenue from our interactive services over the terms of these agreements or upon delivery of each service element.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S8	As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from subscription and service agreements entered into during prior periods.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions or service agreements in any one quarter may not materially affect our financial performance in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S10	In addition, we may be unable to adjust our costs, many of which are fixed, in response to reduced revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S11	Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our services may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make our reported results less indicative of our future prospects.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P34_S12	RISKS RELATED TO OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our applications from operating properly.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If our systems do not function reliably or fail to achieve user or client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us, and members could choose to terminate their use of our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients and members.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Errors may result from sources beyond our control, including the receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information; interface of our services with legacy systems that we did not develop; or errors in data provided by third parties.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S7	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients or members may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Therefore, despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes following introduction to the market.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S9	For example, changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, so we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S10	Because clients rely on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data-including information to assist providers in tracking and treating ill patients-and members rely on our services to provide timely and accurate information regarding medical conditions and medicines, they may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S11	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby give rise to a product liability claim or errors or omissions claim.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S12	Such claims could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of those claims.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P35_S13	Limitations of liability and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software or content which we may include in our subscription and services agreements may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from related claims.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In light of this, defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share; liability to clients, members, their patients, or others; failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion; diversion of development and management resources; delays in the introduction of new services; injury to our reputation; and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients or members from purchasing services from us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P36_S5	The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P36_S6	If our security measures are breached or fail or unauthorized access is obtained to a client s or member s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients and members may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our services involve the web-based storage and transmission of clients and members proprietary information, including personal or identifying information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce customer confidence and require substantial resources to address.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client, member, or patient data.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P37_S4	As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely upon users of our systems for key activities to promote security of those systems and the data within them, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	On occasion, our users have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Failure of users to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales, clients, and members.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	In addition, we use third-party technology and service providers, and our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their patients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S6	For example, we depend on third-party service providers for processing claims data and clinical documents for our clients and we partner with other health care information technology companies to offer our clients more seamless integration with those companies through electronic interfaces.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Vendor management programs and processes for assessment of our partners' information security which we have designed cannot provide absolute security.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our clients may have their own computer systems (whether internally developed or provided by a third party) to manage, store, and transmit clinical and financial data, which may interact with or contain information obtained from our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because we do not control our vendors , partners , or clients information security systems, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of these systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	A security breach of our vendors , partners , or clients system may damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to cancel their contracts, subject us to third-party lawsuits, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S7	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S8	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S9	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Various events could interrupt users access to our systems, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P39_S11	The ability to access our systems is critical to our clients administration of care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) terrorism and acts of war; (iv) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our systems or those of others; and (v) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our systems or those of others.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If users access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to those clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely in part upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Our business interruption insurance only covers some, but not all, of these potential events, and even for those events that are covered, it may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events, including, for example, loss of market share and diminution of our brand, reputation, and member and client loyalty.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S8	We rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users or clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S9	In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we serve our clients primarily from third-party data-hosting facilities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S10	These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S11	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S12	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S13	Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S14	Our ability to deliver our Internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P40_S15	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable mobile device, telephone, facsimile, and pager systems.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment or service providers, to provide our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users or clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and clients, adversely affect our brands and business, and expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The insurance coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Features and safeguards we have implemented to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, members, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our software, content, and services are used to assist clinical decision-making and provide information about patient medical histories, treatment plans, medical conditions, and the use of particular medications.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, members, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our athenaClinicals service is utilized in clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Therefore, if these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us by clients, clinicians, patients, or others.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	We often have little control over data accuracy, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of health care services or erroneous health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our Epocrates clinical reference tools and interactive services provide health care professionals with access to clinical information, including information regarding particular medical conditions and the use of particular medications.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, or we introduce inaccuracies in the process of implementing third-party content, it is possible that patients, physicians, consumers, the providers of the third-party content, or others may sue us if they are harmed as a result of such inaccuracies.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content, and we have had content errors in the past.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages; have our members assume responsibility for medical oversight and dosing decisions; and require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Furthermore, general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S7	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S8	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P46_S9	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION Government regulation of health care creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the health care industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Many health care laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	enacted, did not anticipate the health care information and interactive services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate, particularly as we develop and release new and more sophisticated products and services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Some of the risks we face from health care regulation are described below: False or Fraudulent Claim Laws .
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that prohibit submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In some cases, these laws also prohibit abuse in connection with such submission and payment.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S6	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S7	CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to engage in or overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S8	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software and services relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P51_S10	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to those clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations .
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In particular, HIPAA includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity subject to HIPAA.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In addition, our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	access by the HHS to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it (including the omnibus rule promulgated in January 2013) have provided clarification of certain aspects of both the Privacy and Security Rules, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the Security Rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In addition, ONCHIT is coordinating the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the health care sector.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P55_S5	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, and their interpretations are no less stringent than ours, we seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our clients, and since we do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of those clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Among our services, we provide automated reminder services to patients, Internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and other personally identifiable information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition to false claims and HIPAA requirements, we are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to health care providers and patients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	For example, the federal health care programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal health care program.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws prohibit bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients, vendors, or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Legislation relating to payments to physicians .
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Legislation enacted or pending in several states and enacted at the federal level as part of the ACA and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 mandates public disclosure of, or otherwise regulates or limits the providing of, certain gifts and payments by pharmaceutical companies to physicians.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	These laws may be interpreted to cover honorarium payments made to physicians for participation in market research activities sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Because we currently provide market research services involving participants from our member network, the increased adoption and enforcement of these laws and the application of any public disclosure requirements or other limitations may have a negative impact on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to sponsor these activities or the willingness of physicians to participate in the market research.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P60_S4	We cannot predict how pharmaceutical companies or physicians will respond when such legislation becomes more widespread or becomes effective at the federal level.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P60_S5	A significant decline in the sponsorship of our market research services by pharmaceutical companies or the agencies that represent such companies, or a significant decline in physicians willingness to participate in such studies could negatively impact our operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with health care providers.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	These vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal anti-referral laws the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practice clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P61_S4	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws .
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our practice clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our service fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	States have differing prescription format requirements, and, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Regulatory authorities such as the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Any determination that we or our practice clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P65_S4	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a company that provides EHR functionality, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The software component of our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2014 Edition compliant Complete EHR by an ONC-ATCB in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the HHS.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We cannot be certain that our system will meet future requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of medical practice claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	To the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our practice clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for health care services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and time frames may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by practice clients.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The practice of most health care professions requires licensing under applicable state law.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities from practicing medicine.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We employ and contract with physicians who provide only medical information to our users, some of whom may be consumers, and we do not intend to provide medical care or advice.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Any determination that we are a health care provider and acted improperly as a health care provider may result in liability to us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Regulation of drug and medical device advertising and promotion .
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	We provide services involving promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Any increase in regulation of these areas by the FDA; the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC; or other governmental bodies at the federal, state, or local level, could make it more difficult for us to contract for certain of our interactive services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Physician groups and others have criticized the FDA s current policies and have called for restrictions on advertising of prescription drugs and for increased FDA enforcement.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	In response, the FDA has conducted hearings and sought public comment regarding its regulation of information concerning drugs on the Internet and the relationships between pharmaceutical companies and those disseminating information on drugs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	We cannot predict what actions the FDA or industry participants may take in response to these criticisms.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P74_S3	It is also possible that new laws would be enacted that impose restrictions on such marketing and advertising.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Our interactive services revenues could be materially reduced by additional restrictions on the marketing or advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices, whether imposed by law or regulation or by policies adopted by industry members.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	If the FDA, the FTC, or another governmental body finds that any information available on our website or distributed by us violates FDA, FTC, or other laws or regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state s consumer protection statutes or other new or existing laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	In addition, in February 2011 the FDA issued a final rule regarding regulation of Medical Device Data Systems ("MDDS"), which are systems that are intended to transfer, store, convert, or display medical device data.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P76_S2	While EHRs are expressly exempted from the final rule, it is possible that future changes in our services could involve the transfer, storage, conversion, or display of medical device data.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In April 2014, a draft report developed by the FDA, ONCHIT, and the Federal Communications Commission, was released proposing a regulatory framework for health information technology for the purpose of promoting innovation, protecting patient safety, and avoiding regulatory duplication.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	To the extent that our software is considered a medical device under the policy or an MDDS under the final rule, or is the subject of additional regulation promulgated as a result of the report, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing software development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and customer service providers, for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Due to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to government regulation unrelated to health care.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	While our services are primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to health care, certain aspects of those services may require us to comply with regulatory schemes from other areas.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Examples of such regulatory schema include: Anti-spam Laws .
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P82_S3	We may be required to comply with current or future anti-spam legislation by limiting or modifying some of our interactive services, such as our clinical messaging, which may result in a reduction in our revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	One such law, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM, became effective in the United States on January 1, 2004.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	CAN-SPAM imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with the sending of commercial e-mail.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	CAN-SPAM or similar laws may impose burdens on our member communication practices and on certain of our services, which in turn could harm our ability to attract new payer and pharmaceutical clients and increase revenues.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Our national cloud-based network allows us access to cost and pricing data for a large number of providers in most regional markets, as well as to the contracted rates for third-party payers.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P84_S3	To the extent that our services enable providers to compare their cost and pricing data with those of their competitors, those providers could collude to increase the pricing for their services, to reduce the compensation they pay their employees, or to collectively negotiate agreements with third parties.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Similarly, if payers are able to compare their contracted rates of payment to providers, those payers may seek to reduce the amounts they might otherwise pay.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P84_S5	Such actions may be deemed to be anti-competitive and a violation of federal antitrust laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P84_S6	To the extent that we are deemed to have enabled such activities, we could be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission and be required to curtail or terminate the services that permitted such collusion.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	As a billing service that offers patient communication and registration services, our employees or those of our service providers may from time to time come into contact with patients who owe our clients outstanding amounts.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Communications with patients that relate to amounts owed may be deemed to subject us or our service providers to federal or state debt collection laws and regulations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Such laws and regulations, if deemed to apply to us, could require registration with government agencies and compliance with significant administrative obligations ( e.g. , to maintain an in-state office with local employees), which could result in increased expenses and subject us to fines and penalties for violation.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Following the disclosure in 2012 of the methods used by debt collector Accretive Health to obtain payment of amounts owed by patients to one of its hospital clients, heightened focus on debt collection practices may lead to additional regulation and greater scrutiny of existing debt collection practices.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use, and dissemination of data, and the presentation of website or other electronic content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security, and access.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Courts may also adopt these developing standards.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	A number of states, including California, have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the release of credit card or other personal information received from consumers.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	In addition, several foreign governments have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S2	For example, the European Union, or EU, adopted the Data Protection Directive, or DPD, imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information online.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S3	The DPD provides for specific regulations requiring all non-EU countries doing business with EU member states to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Similarly, Canada s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S5	Foreign governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities, and our practice management services for practices along the Canadian border and our market research services could each involve the personal information of foreign residents.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S6	Furthermore, in the conduct of our market research activities outside of the United States, we rely upon a third party to identify and recruit respondents for the market research and to comply with the applicable privacy laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S7	We cannot assure you that this third party will successfully comply with such laws or that we would not be responsible for any failure of this third party to comply.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S8	We cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P87_S9	Whether and how existing local and international privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the Internet and other online technologies is still uncertain and may take years to resolve.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	the amount and utility of the information that we would be permitted to collect.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or services, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S2	In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices, or those of our agents, do not meet these standards could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S4	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S5	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S6	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P88_S7	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Other relationships permit third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S2	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S3	In each of these cases, we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S4	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided, as well as the channel relationships themselves, may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S5	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S6	Any misconduct by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients, any failure to follow contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S7	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S8	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and lead analysts or investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, resulting in reduction in the market price of our stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S9	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S10	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S11	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S12	If any of our employees or subcontractors takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S13	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S14	Subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand if we do not participate in such programs.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S15	In the past few years, various entities and federal programs have provided subsidies for services similar to ours, including EHR initiatives.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S16	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to qualify for and participate in such subsidy programs in the future.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P90_S17	To the extent that we do not participate in such programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P92_S2	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P92_S5	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	the ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our by-laws.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P93_S2	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally an entity that, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P94_S2	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P94_S3	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, stockholders ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Therefore, investors are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_16_ITEM1A_P95_S3	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters is located in Watertown, Massachusetts on the Arsenal on the Charles campus, which we own.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Arsenal on the Charles is a 29-acre, multi-building, commercial property.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	It includes approximately 762,000 square feet of office space.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	In May 2013, we purchased the Arsenal on the Charles campus where we were leasing space for our headquarters and related operating activities prior to the transaction.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	We currently occupy 415,353 square feet of these facilities and lease the remainder to third parties.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P1_S4	Additionally, we own a complex of buildings, including approximately 210,400 square feet of office space, on approximately 53 acres of land in Belfast, Maine, as well as a conference and training facility on approximately 396 acres of land in Northport, Maine.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P1_S5	We lease the remainder of our facilities in various locations in the United States, including: Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Princeton, New Jersey; and San Francisco, California; and in Chennai, India.
1131096_16_ITEM2_P1_S6	Additionally, we operate data centers nationwide.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	Case No. 5:13-cv-945, on behalf of a putative class of Epocrates stockholders against Epocrates and its former officers and directors.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaint asserted claims under sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased Epocrates stock in its initial public offering ( IPO ) and claims under sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all stockholders that purchased shares between February 2, 2011 (the day after the IPO) and August 9, 2011.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	On October 8, 2013, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging only claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and voluntarily dismissing a number of the individual defendants.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S3	Plaintiffs allege that Epocrates made false or misleading statements with respect to the fact that Epocrates pharmaceutical clients were awaiting guidance from the Food and Drug Administration on the use of advertising and social media, which caused the clients to delay marketing and negatively impacted the timing of Epocrates sales and revenue growth.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S4	The complaint seeks certification as a class action, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, plaintiffs costs, attorneys fees, and such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S5	On December 9, 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S6	On June 4, 2014, the court issued an order dismissing the complaint and granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S7	On June 30, 2014, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which asserts substantially similar claims as those set forth in the first amended complaint.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S8	On July 14, 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S9	On October 2, 2014, the court granted plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint by October 23, 2014, and denied the motion to dismiss as moot.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S10	Plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on October 23, 2014, which asserts substantially similar claims on behalf of all stockholders that purchased shares between February 1, 2011, and August 9, 2011.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S11	We filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint on November 10, 2014, and the court denied the motion on March 13, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S12	On April 27, 2015, we filed our answer to the third amended complaint denying the allegations in the third amended complaint.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S13	On September 22, 2015, the parties reached an agreement in principle on a comprehensive settlement of all claims asserted in the lawsuit with no admission of liability by any defendants and with any settlement amounts being funded by insurance.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P0_S14	The court preliminarily approved the settlement on December 16, 2015 and set a final approval hearing for May 2016.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	On May 21, 2015, a class action petition was filed by St. Louis Heart Center, Inc. in the State Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, against athenahealth.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	The petition alleges we violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the TCPA ).
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company was served on July 11, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	On August 10, 2015, the case was removed to federal court in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Case No. 4:15-cv-01215.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S4	We served a Rule 68 offer of judgment, offering the plaintiff relief for its individual claims on August 11, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S5	On November 2, 2015, the court entered an order staying the case pending the United States Supreme Court s (the Supreme Court ) decision in Campbell-Ewald v. Gomez, No. 14-857 ( Campbell-Ewald ).
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S6	On January 20, 2016, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Campbell-Ewald.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P1_S7	We intend to vigorously defend this action.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	On September 4, 2015, a class action petition was filed by Michigan Urgent Primary Care Physicians, P.C., in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Case No. 2:15-cv-13156, against athenahealth.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The petition alleges we violated the TCPA.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	The Company was served on September 9, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P2_S3	We served a Rule 68 offer of judgment, offering the plaintiff relief for its individual claims on October 16, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P2_S4	On December 2, 2015, the court continued the matter for 60 days pending the Supreme Court s decision in Campbell-Ewald.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P2_S5	On January 20, 2016, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Campbell-Ewald.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P2_S6	We intend to vigorously defend this action.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	In addition, from time to time we may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1131096_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	We do not, however, currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ATHN.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 1, 2016 was $142.59 per share.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 1, 2016 , we had 81 holders of record of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P1_S3	Dividends We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P1_S4	We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P1_S5	Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Performance Graph The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Set forth below is a graph comparing the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the NASDAQ Composite-Total Returns Index and the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 , assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None.
1131096_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the quarter ended December 31, 2015 , there were no purchases made by us, on our behalf, or by any affiliated purchasers of shares of our common stock.
1131096_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables summarize our consolidated financial data for the periods presented.
1131096_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	You should read the following financial information together with the information under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to these consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods.
1131096_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) The Balance Sheet Data table above reflects the early adoption of ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance , and ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1131096_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the application of debt issuance costs as a reduction to the related debt liability; such costs were previously included in assets.
1131096_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	The adoption of ASU 2015-17 resulted in all current deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities being reported as non-current in 2015, while prior period deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were not adjusted.
1131096_16_ITEM6_P2_S2	We determined that neither adoption had a material effect on our financial position or earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes to these financial statements, and the other financial information that appears elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements, including those regarding our expectations about our growth; expanded sales and marketing efforts; market trends; investments to support continued growth, new service offerings, and infrastructure expansion; the expected benefits from the 'network effect'; acceleration of our entry into the inpatient market through use of the webOMR technology and integration of Razor Insights, LLC; changes in expenses related to operations, selling, marketing, research and development, general and administrative matters, and depreciation and amortization; liquidity matters; and the expected performance period and estimated term of our client relationships, as well as more general statements regarding our management's expectations for future financial and operational performance and expenditure, profitability, and business outlook.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue; the negative of these terms; or other comparable terminology.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Forward-looking statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	These factors include, among other things, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Except as required by law, we are under no duty to update or revise any of such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview athenahealth provides cloud-based business services that empower health care providers to achieve and sustain financial health while staying focused on quality patient care.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	These services are designed to minimize the hassles that health care providers and their staff face from complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many related tasks that can take attention away from delivering care.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	We deliver the majority of our service offerings using a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	These integrated service offerings include: revenue cycle and practice management, electronic health records ( EHR ), patient engagement, and order transmission.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our model combines a cloud-based network, knowledge, and back-office work, which we refer to as network, knowledge and work, to help keep health care providers profitable and prepared for every change.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	Including our clients on the same instance of software creates a network effect.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	We believe that this network effect enables each client to benefit from the collective experience of other clients.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	As the network grows, we believe these benefits also expand.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	athenaNet acts as the conduit for the exchange of information among clients, payers, trading partners, and our staff of experts.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	It enables us to learn continuously, innovate with agility, and deliver instant updates that rapidly improve performance.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	This work ranges from receiving, scanning, and delivering incoming faxes to tracking claims with payers and managing denials.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	We automate this work whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work at massive scale with our teams of experts.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	The knowledge we gain from doing work for our clients is culled, curated, and captured within athenaNet through mechanisms that include a patented billing rules engine and clinical quality management engine.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S6	As we work with clients, payers, and other industry trading partners, more expert knowledge is infused into each service, which we believe makes athenaNet smarter and more powerful for our clients.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S7	This unique combination of network, knowledge, and work is fundamental to our service model and value proposition to clients.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S8	We also provide clients in the health care industry ( e.g. , pharmaceutical companies, managed care companies, and market research firms) the opportunity to sponsor clinical decision support services in order to engage with our Epocrates member network and offer the sale of subscriptions to Epocrates premium drug and clinical reference tools to health care professionals.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S9	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we generated revenue of $924.7 million from the sale of our services compared to $752.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $595.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S10	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have also increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P3_S11	Our revenue is predominately derived from our athenahealth-branded business services, which excludes revenue from Epocrates-branded services, third-party tenant revenue, and other non-core revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	and our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Therefore, the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians and other health care providers working within our client accounts, the collections of these physicians and providers, and the number of services purchased.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	To provide these services, we incur expenses in several categories, including direct operating, selling and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	In general, our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our intended growth rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician and hospital clients.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	Our research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future, our overall business management activities, and our infrastructure.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P4_S5	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity and to ensure adherence to related financial covenants.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2014, we began to sell go-live and training support services separately from the required implementation services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Fees associated with required implementation services are included in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, they are being recognized ratably over the customer life.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Go-live and training support services can be purchased by the customer from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, are recognized upon delivery of service.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	Previously deferred revenue balances related to implementation services, including go-live and training support services, will continue to be amortized over those remaining customer lives.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	The effect of this change was not significant, nor do we expect that it will ever be significant, to our consolidated revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ).
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S7	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S8	The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained, and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S9	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and assumptions, and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S10	We may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P5_S11	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, as they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	All revenue, other than initial implementation and provider adds revenue, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the client, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	We derive the majority of our revenue from business services associated with our integrated services and from subscriptions to and sponsored clinical information and decision support services for our point of care medical application.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our integrated services consist of revenue cycle and practice management, EHR, patient engagement, and order transmission.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year service contracts related to our integrated services that renew automatically.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based upon a percentage of collections posted to our network, athenaNet; minimum fees; flat fees; or per-claim fees, where applicable.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	We do not recognize revenue for business services until these collections are made, as the fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the subsequent month and delivered to clients primarily by e-mail.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	For most of our clients, amounts due are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Determining whether and when some of our revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied often involves judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	For example, our assessment of the likelihood of collection is a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	If we do not believe that collection is reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Multiple element arrangements require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	We maintain a standard price list by service; however, certain incentives, such as discounts, may be offered to clients.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Due to the variability in the amount of discount offered for individual services across multiple contracts, we have not been able to conclude that a consistent number of stand-alone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	When we cannot establish VSOE of fair value, we determine if we can establish third-party evidence ( TPE ) of fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	Our services differ significantly from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P13_S6	Therefore, we are unable to determine TPE.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments is reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our calculation of BESP may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	For example, if our BESP is too high or too low for an individual deliverable or group of deliverables, the amount of revenue recognized within each reporting period would be inaccurate.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	The amount of deferred revenue related to separable deliverables with BESP is $23.1 million and $22.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our estimate of the expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	For example, if, in the future, we need to increase our expected performance period to a period longer than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	On the other hand, if, in the future, we need to decrease our expected performance period to a period shorter than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	The amount of deferred revenue related to initial implementation and provider add fees is $62.9 million and $60.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Description Judgment and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Subscriptions to the Epocrates point of care medical application are entered into by members via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable license code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Basic subscriptions are free and do not expire.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Premium subscription fees are assessed on the length of the subscription period, typically one year, and payment occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed; such payments are therefore recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	Premium subscriptions are recognized ratably over the contracted term of delivery.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	If a license code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Sponsored clinical information and decision support service clients typically enter into one-year arrangements containing various services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	These clients are charged a fee for the group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	Because billings typically occur in advance of services being performed, these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when billed.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return, as we deliver services and not products.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	We consider a deliverable to have stand-alone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	Since VSOE and TPE do not exist, we use BESP to establish fair value and to allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	We determine BESP for a service by performing an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that service, which takes into account market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, and pricing practices.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Multiple element arrangements require judgment as to whether deliverables meet the criteria to be separated into separate units of accounting.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We consider a deliverable to have stand-alone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the client.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	We concluded that our past go to market strategy of charging initial implementation services, as well as subsequent provider add fees, related to our integrated services was not separable from the ongoing business services, as these services did not have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	As these services did not have stand-alone value, they were recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected customer life.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	During 2014, we began to sell initial go-live and training support services separate from the initial required implementation services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	Go-live and training support services can be purchased from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, have stand-alone value and are recognized upon delivery of service.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P22_S5	Previously deferred revenue balances related to initial implementation services that were billed upfront and did not have stand-alone value will continue to be amortized over those remaining customer lives.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P22_S6	Also, in 2014, we began to include the fees associated with the initial required implementation services in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, they are being recognized ratably over the customer life.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Description Judgment and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is then accounted for as a separate unit; deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion, and we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable using our best estimate of selling price ( BESP ).
1131096_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Any discount or premium inherent in the arrangement is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Other services consist primarily of tenant revenue which is straight-lined over the term of the lease.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the expected customer life.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P25_S4	We determined the expected customer life considering the following key factors: - Renewal rate considerations - Economic life of the service - Industry data The expected customer life, or expected performance period, for the years presented is 12 years.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Business Combinations, including purchased intangible assets are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Measurement period adjustments relate to adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information that we should have known at the time of acquisition.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	All changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant s viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually on November 30 th or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets and the fair value of the reporting unit during goodwill impairment tests include, but are not limited to, identifying reporting units, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers, expected future cash outflows, the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, estimated useful lives of these intangible assets, and a probability-weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Significant judgment in testing goodwill for impairment also includes assigning assets and liabilities to the reporting unit and determining the fair value of each reporting unit based on management s best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management s best estimates and assumptions are employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets, which are finite-lived assets.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $229.2 million and $126.2 million, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $198.0 million and $139.4 million, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	All of our software is considered internal use for accounting purposes, as we do not market or sell our software.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	As a result, we capitalize certain costs associated with the creation of internally-developed software for internal use (i.e., athenaNet), the purchase of internally-developed software via asset acquisition (i.e., webOMR), and third-party software licenses.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	The total of these costs are recorded in the Capitalized Software Costs line on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of athenaNet services and other internally-developed software for internal use including those acquired via asset acquisition.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Costs incurred during the application development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable that the development will result in new or additional functionality.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), as well as external consultant fees for individuals working on these projects.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Capitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life when the asset has been placed in service for general availability.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Significant judgments related to internally-developed software include determining whether it is probable that projects will result in new or additional functionality; concluding on when the application development phase starts and ends; and deciding which costs, especially employee compensation costs, should be capitalized.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Additionally, there is judgment applied to the useful lives of capitalized software; we have concluded that the useful lives for capitalized internally-developed software are two to five years.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Purchased internally-developed capitalized software requires judgment regarding its relative fair value among the other assets or liabilities acquired.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Any services purchased from the acquiree, as well as contingent payments post-acquisition, must be assessed to ensure only costs associated with creating new or additional functionality within the application development phase are capitalized.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Transaction costs are generally capitalized as part of asset acquisitions.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Company management employs its best estimates and assumptions in determining the appropriateness of the judgments noted above on a project-by-project basis during initial capitalization as well as subsequent measurement.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	While we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments is reasonable, actual results could differ, and such differences could lead to an increase or decrease in expense.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts of internally-developed capitalized software and purchased internally-developed capitalized software via asset acquisition were $70.0 million and $22.0 million, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the carrying amounts of internally-developed capitalized software and purchased internally-developed capitalized software via asset acquisition were $45.6 million and $0 million, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	We derive our revenue from two sources: business services, and implementation and other services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Business services primarily consists of revenue from our revenue cycle and practice management service; EHR service; patient engagement service; order transmission service; patient access and care coordination service; population health management service; subscriptions, sponsored clinical information, and decision support services for our point of care clinical application (Epocrates); and consulting, training, and go-live support.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	No customers accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , December 31, 2014 , and December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Business services revenue accounted for 96% for the year ended December 31, 2015, and 95% of our total revenues for both of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P44_S4	Business services revenue for athenahealth-branded services is typically 2% to 8% of a practice s total collections depending upon the services purchased, the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice, plus a per statement charge for certain billing statements that are generated for patients.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P44_S5	Accordingly, business services revenue is largely driven by: the number of physician practices and other service providers we serve, the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians, the mix of our services used by those physician practices and other medical providers, and our contracted rates.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Typically, discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our pharmaceutical clients budgeting process impacts the timing of revenue related to sales of sponsored clinical information and decision support services, which have historically been highest in the fourth quarter.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Additionally, the volume of activity and related collections vary from year to year based in large part on the severity, length, and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	While we believe that the severity, length, and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season will continue to impact collections by our physician clients, there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Implementation and other services revenue consists primarily of the amortization of deferred revenue on implementation services, as well as third-party tenant revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	We expect the amortization of deferred implementation fees to remain constant or decline, as we began including implementation fees in our ongoing monthly rate in 2014 and charging separately for training and go-live services, which can also be purchased from a third-party vendor.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Additionally, we expect third-party tenant revenue to decline in the foreseeable future as tenants vacate and we occupy the previously rented space at our corporate headquarters.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Direct operating expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) related to personnel who provide services, including implementation of new clients, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing arrangements and clearing house, and claim processing costs.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	We include in direct operating expense all service costs incurred to fulfill our customer contracts.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	We expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation, with higher volumes of work in particular functions, geographies, and medical specialties.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	Although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future, direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenue as we increase automation.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	Direct operating expense also includes costs associated with third-party tenant and other non-core revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P48_S6	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, or amortization, except for amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for sales and marketing employees and marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and online initiatives).
1131096_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	Although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and an additional portion at the time our services commence.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	We expect to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional personnel and investing in marketing campaigns to increase our access to health care provider organizations, as well as increase the awareness of athenahealth in the marketplace.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P49_S4	As a result, we expect that, in the near-term, selling and marketing expense will increase in line with our intended revenue growth.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P49_S5	As we begin to leverage lower cost sales channels, we expect selling and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Sales and marketing expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, or amortization, except for amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Research and development expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for research and development employees and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Research and development expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, or amortization.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for administrative employees, occupancy and other indirect costs (including building maintenance and utilities), and outside professional fees for accountants, lawyers, and consultants.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets over the determined useful lives and amortization of capitalized software over a two to five-year period from the time it is ready for its intended use.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	As we grow, we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business and we will continue to capitalize software that we develop.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase as we make investments to support our continued growth, new service offerings, and infrastructure expansion.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our term and revolving loans under our current credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing fees.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P53_S4	Other income (expense) consists primarily of gains realized from the sale of marketable securities.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	We previously invested a total of $1.1 million in Castlight Health, Inc. ( Castlight ), a leading provider of cloud-based software that enables enterprises to control health care costs.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	This investment was initially recorded at cost.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	On March 14, 2014, an initial public offering ( IPO ) of shares of Castlight s Class B common stock was made available for sale on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CSLT.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result of the IPO, we classified this investment as available-for-sale and marked the shares we hold to market based on quoted market prices.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate fair value of the investment was $41.0 million and was recorded in the Marketable securities line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , all shares held in Castlight have been sold.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Income tax (provision) benefit relates to federal and state jurisdictions in the United States and India.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	The difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory tax rate is primarily related to the fact that we have certain permanent items which include, but are not limited to, the treatment of Incentive Stock Options ( ISOs ), our employee stock purchase plan, the impact of tax deduction limits related to certain of our highly compensated officers, lobbying, meals and entertainment, and transaction costs associated with stock acquisitions.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Transaction costs related to stock acquisitions are primarily non-tax deductible.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	We are currently experiencing volatility in our effective tax rate due to the timing of discrete other income items.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	On May 5, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the 2015 Credit Agreement ).
1131096_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	The 2015 Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement, dated as of May 10, 2013 (the "2013 Credit Agreement"), and provides for a $500.0 million senior credit facility consisting of a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2015 Senior Credit Facility ).
1131096_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	The term loans from the 2013 Credit Agreement were increased by $130.0 million and a portion of those proceeds were used to repay the outstanding revolving loans under the 2013 Credit Agreement such that there were no revolving loans outstanding on the closing of the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	On January 23, 2015, we signed an agreement to purchase a suite of internally-developed clinical applications and an EHR system from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) referred to as webOMR for $22.0 million in cash.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	The agreement also provides for up to an additional $18.0 million in contingent payments upon achievement of certain milestones in the future.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	In connection with the purchase of the webOMR technology, the parties also entered into a two-year collaboration agreement under which BIDMC will provide ongoing consultation services with respect to the webOMR technology and provide one of its facilities as a testing site for a new inpatient service offering.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	On January 13, 2015, we acquired Razor Insights, LLC ( RazorInsights ), a provider of cloud-based billing and EHR software services to rural and community hospitals, for $39.9 million in cash after net working capital adjustments.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	value of net assets acquired was $8.9 million, including purchased intangible assets of $7.0 million related to technology acquired and $4.0 million related to customer relationships.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The $31.1 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill, which is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	We incurred transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of $0.3 million, which are included in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	We purchased webOMR and acquired RazorInsights to accelerate our entry into the inpatient market.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which will require entities to present all deferred tax assets ( DTAs ) and deferred tax liabilities ( DTLs ) as non-current on the balance sheet.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	Early adoption is permitted, and entities may choose whether to adopt this update prospectively or retrospectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	We have evaluated ASU 2015-17 and determined that its adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position or earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	On December 31, 2015, we elected to adopt ASU 2015-17 and change our method of classifying DTAs and DTLs as either current or non-current to classifying all DTAs and DTLs as non-current, and have chosen to apply a prospective method.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Prior balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , that eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	The new standard should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	This guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Early adoption is permitted for all entities.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	We have evaluated ASU 2015-16 and determined that its adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position or earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance , which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	Under this guidance, an entity will present such costs in the balance sheet as a reduction of the related debt liability rather than as an asset.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Early adoption is permitted for all entities for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	We have evaluated ASU 2015-03 and determined that its adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position or earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	On December 31, 2015, we elected to adopt ASU 2015-03 and change our method of classifying debt issuance costs whereby we will include debt issuance costs as a reduction to the related debt liability.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	The guidance was applied on a retrospective basis as prior balance sheets were adjusted.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	In addition, ASU 2014-09 provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including, but not limited to, when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	ASU 2014-09 provides companies with two implementation methods.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	Companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application).
1131096_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	Public companies should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P73_S4	We continue to evaluate the expected impact of this new guidance and available adoption methods.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 :
1131096_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Percentages for each line item may not sum to the totals or subtotals for each fiscal year due to rounding.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	The increase in business services revenue was primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	The increases in the number of physicians and providers using our revenue cycle and practice management service; EHR service; and patient engagement service; are as follows:
1131096_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	The amount of collections processed was as follows:
1131096_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Direct operating expense increased primarily due to compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased $37.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 , as a result of a 28% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	We increased headcount due to the increase in the number of providers added to the network, as well as to start a go-live support team during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	In addition, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing and clearing house activities increased $14.2 million, as the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 .

1131096_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Selling and marketing expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to increases in compensation costs and other general selling and marketing-related costs.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase in compensation, which included commissions and stock-based compensation, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $25.0 million, and was largely due to a 15% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	We hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within new and existing markets.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , largely due to a 34% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	The additional research and development personnel were necessary in order to upgrade and expand our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	General and administrative expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and lease termination costs.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S4	Compensation costs increased $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , largely due to a 23% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S5	Additionally, general and administrative expense increased $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to lease termination costs incurred as a result of our growth and evolving strategy.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S6	In the year ended December 31, 2015, income from governmental bodies increased $3.0 million, which offset general and administrative expense, due to our participation in incentive programs.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S7	Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S8	This increase was primarily due to $18.4 million of amortization related to an increase in our software costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and partially due to $10.4 million of depreciation due to a higher fixed asset base.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P81_S9	Other income (expense) increased due to gains realized from the sale of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 , is primarily due to discrete items, specifically, the sale of marketable securities.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase in business services revenue is primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	The increases in the number of physicians and providers using our revenue cycle and practice management service; EHR service; and patient engagement service; are as follows:
1131096_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The amount of collections processed is as follows:
1131096_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Implementation and other revenue increased primarily due to third-party tenant revenue and travel reimbursement, which increased $4.5 million and $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Direct operating expense increased primarily due to employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, which increased $28.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 , as a result of a 17% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Additionally, costs associated with external consulting services increased $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	We increased headcount and the use of consultants due to the increase in number of providers added to the network during the year ended December 31, 2014 .

1131096_16_ITEM7_P86_S4	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Direct operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 also increased $2.5 million due to costs associated with third-party tenant revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expense was in part due to compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, internal sales commissions, and external channel partner commissions, which increased approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , largely due to a 23% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	We hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	Additionally, amortization related to purchased intangible assets allocated to selling and marketing expense increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to our acquisition of Epocrates during the three months ended March 31, 2013.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	Also contributing to the increase in selling and marketing expense was a $10.7 million increase in our marketing program costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased approximately $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , largely due to a 41% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	The additional research and development personnel were necessary in order to upgrade and expand our service offerings and develop new technologies.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	General and administrative expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher compensation costs and facilities-related expenses.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	Compensation costs, including stock-based compensation unrelated to the Epocrates acceleration of vesting associated with our acquisition, increased approximately $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , largely due to an 22% increase in headcount from December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S4	We increased our general and administrative personnel to support our growth.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S5	Facilities-related expenses, which include rent expense, increased $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S6	The increase in headcount drove an increased investment in our infrastructure, which resulted in expansion in four of our locations.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S7	The increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially offset by the absence of $11.8 million of transaction and integration costs we incurred associated with the Epocrates and Arsenal transactions and stock-based compensation related to the acceleration of vesting for certain Epocrates employees upon termination during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S8	Finally, the year ended December 31, 2013 reflected a $2.5 million net gain due to the early termination of our lease and the realization of the remaining balance in deferred rent upon our acquisition of the Arsenal on the Charles.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S9	Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S10	This increase was partially due to $15.2 million of amortization related to an increase in our software costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 , and $6.0 million of depreciation from higher fixed asset expenditures for the same period, including the Arsenal on the Charles which was acquired during the three months ended June 30, 2013.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P90_S11	Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to a full 12 months of interest expense in 2014 for our newest debt agreement that was signed in May 2013.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , is primarily due to a decrease in permanent differences related to non-deductible transaction costs associated with the Epocrates transaction in 2013 and our decrease in earnings before taxes.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity As of December 31, 2015 , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $141.9 million compared to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $114.7 million as of December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we have outstanding indebtedness of $300.0 million compared to $208.8 million as of December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	On May 10, 2013, we entered into the 2013 Credit Agreement that provided for a five-year $325.0 million senior credit facility consisting of a $200.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $125.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	On May 5, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the 2013 Credit Agreement, and provides for the 2015 Senior Credit Facility, consisting of a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	A portion of the proceeds received from the 2015 Senior Credit Facility were used to repay the outstanding revolving loans under the 2013 Credit Agreement such that there were no revolving loans outstanding on the closing of the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P93_S3	The 2015 Credit Agreement may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, including indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Agreement, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P93_S4	We may increase the revolving credit facility up to an additional $100.0 million and may increase the term loan facility to the extent that such amount will not cause us to be in breach of our financial covenants (such as compliance with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio, and consolidated senior leverage ratio), subject to certain conditions, including obtaining lender commitments.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P93_S5	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility matures on May 5, 2020.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	term loan facility and we had nothing drawn on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had $200.0 million available on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our covenants under the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to make payments on our contractual obligations, and to purchase property and equipment in the foreseeable future.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P94_S4	In addition, our 2015 Senior Credit Facility will provide flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives in the future, if needed.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P94_S5	Our analysis is supported by the growth in our new client base and a high rate of renewal with our existing clients, as well as the corresponding increase in billings and collections.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P94_S6	There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under these credit facilities or obtain additional financing.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Commitments We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the 2015 fiscal year.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Operating Cash Flow Activities Net income after non-cash and reclassification adjustments contributed an additional $21.9 million to cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	The non-cash adjustments were driven by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $24.2 million related to our growth, which was offset by $28.7 million in gains from the sales of Castlight stock.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	Additionally, there was a decrease in cash provided by working capital of $7.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily driven by the bonus accrual related to headcount growth.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S3	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $71.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily due to our acquisition of RazorInsights for $39.9 million, net of cash acquired, which is included in the payments for acquisitions line, and an increase of $44.3 million in capitalized software costs, which includes our purchase of webOMR for $22.0 million.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S4	We expect to continue to increase our investment in capitalized software costs as we develop new and enhance existing services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S5	Note that in 2015 we had cash spend of $ 97.8 million related to capitalized software.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S6	The cash spend consisted of $84.4 million related to internally-developed software, including the $22.0 million webOMR asset acquisition, while the remaining $13.3 million related to acquired software licenses.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S7	We increased our investments in property and equipment in 2015 by $11.1 million , primarily related to investments in computer equipment to support our data centers and continued improvements to our owned properties, as well as expansion in our leased facilities.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S8	Net cash used in investing activities was offset by $29.8 million of cash provided from the sales of Castlight stock.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S9	Financing Cash Flow Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily due to $106.3 million of net proceeds received from the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P97_S10	For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that income taxes paid for the net settlement of restricted stock unit awards will be greater than the cash received for stock option exercises due to the stock price and the increase in the issuance of restricted stock units compared to stock options.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Operating Cash Flow Activities The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to an increase in net income after non-cash adjustments due to our growth in operations.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	The non-cash adjustments include an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $32.0 million resulting from the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities is due in part to an $26.3 million increase in accrued compensation due to our headcount growth.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	Further, the purchase of the Arsenal on the Charles, which we previously leased, and our recent execution of new leases which include free rent and other leasehold incentives, provided an additional increase of $12.1 million.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	These increases in cash were offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to our growth, which decreased cash provided by operating activities by $34.4 million in the period.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S3	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $297.6 million to $127.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S4	In the prior year, our spend included cash paid for the acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles of $410.2 million, net of cash acquired, which was offset by $56.2 million of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S5	We have increased our investments in property and equipment in 2014 by $76.1 million.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S6	In conjunction with our 2013 purchase of the Arsenal on the Charles, our Board of Directors approved a plan to improve the campus for our employees and to open the space to local residents.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S7	We began to recognize costs associated with this plan in 2014 and expect these investments to increase in the foreseeable future to support our continued growth and new service offerings.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S8	Additional capital expenditures also relate to expansion in four of our office locations during 2014.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P99_S9	We have increased our investment in software costs in 2014 by $53.5 million, and we expect investments to continue to increase as we develop and enhance new and existing services.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Financing Cash Flow Activities Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities decreased $254.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the receipt of $200.0 million in proceeds from our term loan and $35.0 million in net proceeds from our line of credit during the year ended December 31, 2013, which we utilized in our acquisitions of Epocrates and the Arsenal on the Charles in the prior year.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that income taxes paid for the net settlement of stock unit awards will be greater than the cash received for stock option exercises because of the recent increase in our stock price and the increase in the issuance of restricted stock units compared to stock options.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 :
1131096_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	(1) We have cash interest requirements due on the 2015 Senior Credit Facility payable at variable rates which are not included in the above table.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	(2) We are party to agreements for non-cancelable operating leases for office space and data centers which expire between 2016 and 2030.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	(3) Other consists of uncertain tax benefits.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P101_S3	We have not recognized these uncertain tax benefits, nor do we have an expectation of when these uncertain tax benefits would be challenged.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P101_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1131096_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	Other than our operating leases, which are primarily for office space and data centers, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues are generated outside of the United States.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	None of our vendor relationships, including our contracts with our offshore service providers for work performed in India and the Philippines, is denominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 , approximately 1% of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in Chennai, India, and were incurred in Indian rupees.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not likely.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We had $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2015 Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility bears interest at the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an interest margin based on (i) our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P0_S8	A one hundred basis point change in the interest rate on our borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $1.8 million annually.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we utilized an interest rate swap to manage exposure to interest rates on the variable rate of our indebtedness.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our interest rate swap is with a major financial institution and is not used for speculative or trading purposes.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We have designated our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, associated with the interest rate swap will be reported in interest expense.
1131096_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	We recorded the interest rate swap at fair value, which amounted to a liability of $0.2 million at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are located beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2015 (the Evaluation Date ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934).
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial and Administrative Officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In conducting this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2015 , our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Deloitte and Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 .
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Changes in Internal Control There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the three months ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_16_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 4, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1131096_16_ITEM15_P6_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P6_S1	Watertown, Massachusetts We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P6_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P7_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P7_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P7_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P7_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P7_S4	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 4, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1131096_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General athenahealth, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our ) provides cloud-based business services that help health care providers achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more revenue and greatly reducing their administrative work burden.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P13_S1	We deliver the majority of our service offerings using a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet, which we continuously update to improve our services.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P13_S2	Our customers consist of medical group practices ranging in size throughout the United States of America.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P13_S3	In March 2013, we acquired Epocrates, Inc. ( Epocrates ).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P13_S4	Epocrates is recognized for developing a leading medical application among U.S. physicians for clinical content, practice tools, and health industry engagement at the point of care.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P13_S5	The features available through the Epocrates services are used by health care providers to make more informed prescribing decisions, improve workflow, and enhance patient safety.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	In January 2015, we acquired Razor Insights, LLC ( RazorInsights ), a provider of cloud-based billing and EHR software services to rural and community hospitals.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P15_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P16_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition, including the expected customer life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock-based compensation; (5) allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; (6) fair value of identifiable purchased tangible and intangible assets in a business combination; (7) determination of the reporting unit(s) for goodwill impairment testing; (8) litigation reserves; and (9) capitalized software costs.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P16_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) or decision-making group in assessing performance and making decisions regarding resource allocation.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	We use consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, and have determined that we operate in one segment.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	The CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, uses non-GAAP adjusted operating income (defined as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before (provision for) benefit from income taxes, total other income (expense), stock-based compensation expense, amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development, amortization of purchased intangible assets, integration and transaction costs, and restructuring costs) as the measure of our profit on a regular basis.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P17_S3	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , our CODM determined that, as our acquired businesses are fully integrated, he reviews and assesses the business as one operating segment.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the customer, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	We derive revenue from two sources: business services, and implementation and other services.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P18_S2	Business services includes revenue from our medical billing and revenue cycle management service; electronic health records ( EHR ) service; patient engagement service; order transmission service; patient access and care coordination service; population health management service; subscriptions, sponsored clinical information, and decision support services for our point of care clinical application; and consulting, training, and go-live support.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P18_S3	Our clients typically purchase one -year service contracts for our integrated services that renew automatically.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P18_S4	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P18_S5	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenaNet; minimum fees; flat fees; or per-claim fees, where applicable.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	We do not recognize revenue for athenahealth-branded business services fees until these collections are made, as the services fees are not fixed and determinable until such time.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P19_S2	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	Members enter into subscriptions to the Epocrates point of care medical application via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable license code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	Basic subscriptions are free and do not expire.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P20_S2	Premium subscription fees are assessed on the length of the subscription period, typically one year.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P20_S3	Payment occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed, and such amounts are recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P20_S4	Premium subscriptions are recognized ratably over the contracted term of delivery, typically one year.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P20_S5	If a license code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	Sponsored clinical information and decision support service clients typically enter into arrangements that contain various combinations of services that are generally fulfilled within one year.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	The clients are charged a fee for the entire group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P21_S2	Because billings typically occur in advance of services being performed, these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when billed.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P21_S3	Each service deliverable within these multiple element revenue arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P21_S4	This is the only criteria we need to assess because our revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return, as we deliver services and not products.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	We consider a deliverable to have stand-alone value if we sell this item separately, if the item is sold by another vendor, or could be resold by the customer.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is then accounted for as a separate unit; deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion, and we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable using our best estimate of selling price ( BESP ) if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value or third-party evidence ( TPE ) of fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Any discount or premium inherent in the arrangement is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	Multiple element arrangements require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P23_S2	Due to the specific nature of these agreements and the variability in the amount of discount offered for individual services across multiple contracts, we have not been able to conclude that a consistent number of stand-alone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established VSOE.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P23_S3	Due to the fact that our services differ significantly from that of our peers and contain a significant level of customization, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained and we are also typically unable to determine TPE.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P23_S4	We therefore use BESP to establish fair value and allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	We determine BESP for a service by considering multiple factors including an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that service, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, and pricing practices.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Implementation and other services revenue consists primarily of the amortization of deferred revenue on implementation services.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	Historically, all of these fees were billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation was complete, and then, as the service did not have stand-alone value, it was recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	We evaluate the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on our experience with customer contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those customers will receive benefits from our current portfolio of services.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	During 2014, we began to sell go-live and training support services separate from the required implementation services.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	Go-live and training support services can be purchased by the customer from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, have stand-alone value and are recognized upon delivery of service.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	When we made this change, we began to include the fees associated with the required implementation services in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, they are being recognized ratably over the customer life.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S4	Previously deferred revenue balances related to implementation services that were billed upfront and did not have stand-alone value will continue to be amortized over those remaining customer lives.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S5	Certain expenses related to the implementation go-live and training of a customer, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the customer.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S6	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S7	Other revenue consists primarily of tenant revenue which is straight-lined over the term of the lease.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S8	Direct Operating Expense Direct operating expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) related to personnel who provide services, including implementation of clients, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing arrangements and clearing house, and claim processing costs.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S9	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S10	We include in direct operating expense all service costs incurred to fulfill our customer contracts.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S11	Direct operating expense also includes costs associated with third-party tenant and other non-core revenue.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P26_S12	Direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, or amortization, except for amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	Research and Development Expense Research and development expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for research and development employees and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	All such costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain internal use software costs, which may be capitalized (refer to Note 6 Capitalized Software Costs).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P27_S2	Research and development expense does not include allocated amounts for rent, occupancy costs, depreciation, or amortization.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, and restricted stock units with compensation cost measured using the fair value of the awards issued.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value share-based awards and determine the related compensation expense.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P28_S2	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	We generally issue previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options; however, we may reissue previously acquired treasury shares to satisfy these awards in the future.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Certain employees have received awards for which the ultimate number of shares that will be subject to vesting is dependent upon the achievement of certain financial targets for the year.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Such determination is not made until the award s vesting determination date, which is the date our fiscal year financial statements are available.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	The award is initially recorded at the maximum attainable number of shares that is most likely to be subject to vesting based on available financial forecasts as of the date of grant.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	This amount is adjusted on a quarterly basis as new financial forecasts become available.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P31_S2	Stock based compensation expense for these awards is recorded over the requisite service period, generally four years.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P31_S3	Such awards generally vest ratably over four years from the vesting determination date.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Advertising Expenses Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	Advertising expense totaled $28.1 million , $15.5 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity from the Company s date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	Investments Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase based upon management s intent with regard to such investments.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Our convertible notes receivable from privately-held companies are accounted for as available-for-sale investments which are carried at cost, which we believe approximates fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Upon conversion, if any, we assess whether such equity investments should be accounted for on a cost basis or equity method, depending on whether we believe we have significant influence over the investee.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Marketable securities, if any, are also accounted for as available-for-sale investments and recorded at fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P34_S3	Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P34_S4	The Company determines realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P34_S5	Management monitors and assesses individual investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	We had no available-for-sale equity securities as of December 31, 2015 due to the sale of our holdings in Castlight Health, Inc. stock during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	We had the following available-for-sale equity securities as of December 31, 2014 :
1131096_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, notes receivables, and accounts receivable.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	We attempt to limit our credit risk associated with cash equivalents and investments by investing and/or depositing in highly-rated corporate and financial institutions, and engaging with highly-rated financial institutions as counterparties to our derivative transactions.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	With respect to customer accounts receivable, we manage our credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	No single customer accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	No single customer accounted for a significant portion of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1131096_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represents unbilled amounts and amounts due from customers for business services.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
1131096_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:
1131096_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
1131096_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the applicable lease terms, excluding renewal periods.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	Capitalized Interest Cost Interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically our corporate headquarters campus project and capitalized internal-use software costs, are capitalized until each underlying asset is placed into service.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the effective interest rate of the outstanding debt by the qualifying costs.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	As the qualifying asset is placed into service, the qualifying asset and the related capitalized interest are amortized over the useful life of the related asset.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Capitalized Software Costs We capitalize certain costs related to the development of athenaNet services and other internal-use software.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Costs incurred during the application development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable the development will result in new or additional functionality.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee wages and stock-based compensation expense, as well as external contractor costs for individuals working on these projects.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P45_S3	Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	The estimated useful life of the software is two to five years (refer to Note 6 Capitalized Software Costs).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the asset carrying value.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P48_S3	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	No impairment losses have been recognized in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 .
1131096_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Purchased Intangible Assets Purchased intangible assets consist of technology, a physician network, content, a trade name and trademark, customer backlog, non-compete agreements, customer relationships, above market leases, leases in place, and an indefinite-lived license related to the development of our headquarters' campus, most of which were acquired in connection with business acquisitions, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of economic benefit expected from each asset.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	We concluded for certain purchased intangible assets that the pattern of economic benefit approximated the straight-line method, and therefore, the use of the straight-line method was appropriate, as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Accrued expenses and accrued compensation Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of rent escalation, tenant improvement allowances and other incentives received from landlords related to the operating leases for our facilities.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	Rent escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which we record over the term of the lease.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	The excess is recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord or paid on our behalf as part of the negotiated terms of the lease.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	These tenant improvement allowances and other incentives are recorded when realizable as deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense, over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	Deferred revenue includes amounts associated with multiple element arrangements associated with sponsored clinical information and decision support services which are recognized based upon contractual deliverables, and previously, deferred implementation services fees which will continue to be recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected customer life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Preferred Stock Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	Our Board of Directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on our common stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of our common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	Common Stock Common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share and dividends, when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to any preferential rights of preferred stockholders.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	We apply business combination accounting when we acquire control over a business.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	Business combinations are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	The associated acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; non-controlling interests, if any, are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development, if any, is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period affect income tax expense; and goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, are based on management s estimates and assumptions, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P62_S3	The results of the acquired businesses operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the combined entity beginning on the date of acquisition.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P62_S4	We have applied this acquisition method to the transaction described in Note 2 Business Combinations.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Related Party Transaction We have a long-term investment in a vendor.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	The total expense related to this vendor for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $23.6 million , $11.3 million , and $1.5 million , respectively, and the total amount payable related to this vendor at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.3 million and $1.3 million , respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P64_S3	We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P64_S4	Our income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the balance sheet date to be recognized in the related period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P64_S5	Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	Sales and Use Taxes Our services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Our contractual agreements with customers provide that payment of any sales or use tax assessments is the responsibility of the customer.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	In certain jurisdictions, sales taxes are collected from the customer and remitted to the respective agencies.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	These taxes are recorded on a net basis and excluded from revenue and expense in our financial statements as presented.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Incentives Received from Governmental Bodies From time to time, we receive incentives from various government agencies and programs.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	We account for the portion of the credits that are expected to be used as grants by reducing general and administrative expense.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	Credits which are expected to be used to reduce general and administrative expense are recognized when the requirements to earn the credits have been met.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P67_S3	We recognized $4.1 million and $1.2 million from our participation in incentive programs during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiary are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P68_S3	Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded within other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	We sponsor a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the 401(k) Plan ), under which eligible employees may contribute, on a pre-tax basis, specified percentages of their compensation, subject to maximum aggregate annual contributions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	individual account and are invested in various investment options as directed by the employee.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	Employees cash contributions are fully vested and non-forfeitable.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	We may make a discretionary contribution in any year, subject to authorization by our Board of Directors.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P70_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 , our contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $5.3 million , $4.5 million , and $3.2 million , respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which will require entities to present all deferred tax assets ( DTAs ) and deferred tax liabilities ( DTLs ) as non-current on the balance sheet.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P71_S2	Early adoption is permitted, and entities may choose whether to adopt this update prospectively or retrospectively.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	We have evaluated ASU 2015-17 and determined that its adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position or earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	On December 31, 2015, we elected to adopt ASU 2015-17 and change our method of classifying DTAs and DTLs as either current or non-current to classifying all DTAs and DTLs as non-current, and have chosen to apply a prospective method.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	Prior balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , that eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	The new standard should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P74_S3	This guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	Early adoption is permitted for all entities.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	We have evaluated ASU 2015-16 and determined that its adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position or earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance , which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	Under this guidance, an entity will present such costs in the balance sheet as a reduction of the related debt liability rather than as an asset.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Early adoption is permitted for all entities for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	We have evaluated ASU 2015-03 and determined that its adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position or earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	On December 31, 2015, we elected to adopt ASU 2015-03 and change our method of classifying debt issuance costs whereby we will include debt issuance costs as a reduction to the related debt liability.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P77_S3	The guidance was applied on a retrospective basis as prior balance sheets were adjusted.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1131096_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	In addition, ASU 2014-09 provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including, but not limited to, when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	ASU 2014-09 provides companies with two implementation methods.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	Companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P79_S2	This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1131096_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P80_S2	Public companies should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P80_S3	Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P80_S4	We continue to evaluate the expected impact of this new guidance and available adoption methods.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	BUSINESS COMBINATIONS RazorInsights On January 13, 2015, we acquired RazorInsights for $39.9 million in cash after net working capital adjustments.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	We acquired RazorInsights for the assembled workforce, technology, customer base, and to accelerate our entry into the inpatient market.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	The fair value of net assets acquired, after measurement period adjustments totaling $1.0 million , was $8.9 million , including purchased intangible assets of $7.0 million related to technology acquired and $4.0 million related to customer relationships.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	The $31.1 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill, which is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	We incurred transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of $0.3 million , which are included in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on information that was available as of the date of the acquisition and upon completion of the valuation.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P85_S2	Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, and shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P85_S3	Under the treasury stock method, dilutive securities are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the periods and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	effect would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share; therefore, in periods of net loss, shares used to calculate basic and dilutive net loss per share are equivalent.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The following table reconciles the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated:
1131096_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 0.7 million and 0.4 million of stock options and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2013 , respectively, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their estimated fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	Derivatives are carried at fair value, as determined using standard valuation models, and adjusted when necessary for credit risk.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	Refer to Note 9 Debt for additional information.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P89_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we had $300.0 million outstanding on our term loan facility and we had not drawn on our revolving credit facility under the 2015 Credit Agreement (see Note 9 Debt).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P89_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , we had $173.8 million outstanding on our term loan facility and $35.0 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Agreement.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P89_S4	The credit facilities under both credit agreements carry a variable interest rate set at current market rates, and as such, the carrying values approximate fair values.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	Our More Disruption Please ( MDP ) Accelerator portfolio is a program designed to cultivate heath care information technology start-ups and expand services offered to our physician network.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	Portfolio investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are in the form of convertible notes receivable and equity, and are recorded in Investments and other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P90_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, as there is no indication of performance risk and while conversion is contemplated for certain investments, we currently estimate that the fair value of the notes receivable approximates cost, based on inputs including the original transaction prices, our own recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investments, subsequent rounds of financing, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows (Level 3).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	Marketable equity securities and money market funds are valued using a market approach based upon the quoted market prices of identical instruments when available or other observable inputs such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets or similar securities.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	Derivative financial instruments are used to manage certain of the Company s interest rate exposures.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	Our interest rate swap agreement was designed to manage exposure to interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	We have designated the interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P94_S2	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) until the hedged items are recognized in earnings.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P94_S3	Hedge ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate swap, if any, will be reported in interest expense.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , no amount was recognized in earnings for our interest rate swap.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	nor was any amount excluded from ineffectiveness testing.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	We do not expect that any of the $0.2 million of pre-tax unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at December 31, 2015 will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P96_S2	This amount will vary due to fluctuations in interest rates.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the swap counterparty.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	The estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreement with a certain financial institution at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was a liability of $0.2 million and $0.2 million , respectively, based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the interest rate swap (Level 2).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P97_S2	Inputs include present value of fixed and projected floating rate cash flows over term of the swap contract.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P97_S3	Refer to Note 9 Debt for further information.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	The following table presents information about our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques we utilized to determine such fair value.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities obtained from readily available pricing sources for similar instruments.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	The fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable values which are supported by little or no market activity.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P98_S3	It is our policy to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period; however, there have been no such transfers during any of the periods presented.

1131096_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	The following table illustrates the range of assumptions used to compute stock-based compensation expense for awards granted:
1131096_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	The risk-free interest rate estimate was based on the U.S. Treasury rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected terms of the awards being valued.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	The expected dividend yield was based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	We use company-specific historical and implied volatility information to generate the volatility assumptions.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , there was $11.4 million and $16.5 million , respectively, of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock option share-based compensation arrangements granted under our stock award plans.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.1 years.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 was $49.29 , $77.55 , and $38.09 , respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P125_S1	The intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 was $44.3 million , $53.5 million , and $53.2 million , respectively.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P125_S2	The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market value of the stock on the date of purchase and the exercise price of the options.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P125_S3	The 2007 Plan also allows for granting of restricted stock unit awards under the terms of the plan.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	The majority of the restricted stock units vest in four equal, annual installments on the anniversaries of the vesting start date or in four equal, quarterly installments on anniversaries of the vesting date.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	We estimated the fair value of the restricted stock units using the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	The fair value of restricted stock units is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

1131096_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of athenahealth, Inc; 2.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P176_S1	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 3.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P176_S2	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 4.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P176_S3	The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: (a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; (b) designed such internal controls over financial reporting, or caused such internal controls over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (c) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and (d) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 5.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P176_S4	The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s Board of Directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): (a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	The following certification is being made to the Securities and Exchange Commission solely for purposes of Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C. 1350).
1131096_16_ITEM15_P177_S1	This certification is not to be deemed a part of the Report, nor is it deemed to be filed for any purpose whatsoever.
1131096_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	In accordance with the requirements of Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 USC 1350), each of the undersigned hereby certifies, to our knowledge, that: (i) this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 , which this statement accompanies, fully complies with the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)); and (ii) the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 , fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of athenahealth, Inc. Dated as of this 4th day of February 2016.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS GENERAL We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The provision by third parties of medical billing and practice management services to medical practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty, a limited set of payers, or a limited geographical area.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We anticipate that the software, statistical, and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Electronic health records, or EHR, and practice management software for health systems and medical groups has historically been dominated by large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these entities are now offering hosted services or software-as-a-service models under which software is centrally administered, and these vendors may also provide administrative and billing services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The size, financial strength, and breadth of offerings of the larger entities are increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect large integrated technology companies to continue to become more active in our markets, both through acquisition and internal investment.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, a few smaller companies have started providing single-instance, internet-based software using a model similar to ours; the offerings of these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage of our services and impact our market share.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Further, while the market for patient engagement, population health and care coordination services is growing and is not as yet dominated by a small group of vendors with significant resources, our patient engagement, population health, and care coordination services face competition from a wide variety of market participants.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	developed their own patient portals, population health, and care coordination systems.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If we fail to distinguish our patient engagement, population health, and care coordination offerings from the other options available to healthcare providers, the demand for and market share of those offerings may decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, we compete with other companies for users of the types of drug and clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from our pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We compete within a broad industry of healthcare content providers for the attention of healthcare professionals who can choose to use mobile, online, or print media to reference clinical information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Companies providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Competition from each of these sources of clinical reference content may lead to a loss of our existing network members and a reduction in the rate at which we attract new members for our clinical information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our primary competition for the promotional spend available from our pharmaceutical clients in the area of interactive services is from companies, including WebMD, that help such companies market their products, programs, and services to healthcare professionals.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our market research business competes with numerous companies that recruit physicians to participate in surveys in a variety of formats, as well as the recruitment arms of market research companies that have assembled their own survey panels of healthcare professionals.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	To the extent competing channels are available to access healthcare professionals, including physicians, the value of our interactive services to our clients is reduced.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Some of our current large competitors, such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Cerner Corporation; Epic Systems Corporation; McKesson Corp.; and Quality Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We expect to face new competitors as we continue to develop and offer services for the inpatient market.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Further, in light of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S11	We face competition from new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, and from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target markets.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P5_S12	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The market for cloud-based services for healthcare information technology may not develop substantially further or develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The market for cloud-based services for healthcare information technology remains narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of cloud-based services in general, and for their revenue, clinical, and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to a cloud-based service.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Changes in the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	As the healthcare industry evolves, changes in our member, client, and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S8	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of healthcare providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Such larger healthcare organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	General reductions in expenditures by healthcare companies, or reductions in such expenditures within market segments that we serve, could have similar impacts with regard to our interactive services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Such reductions may result from, among other things, reduced governmental funding for healthcare; a decrease in the number of, or the market exclusivity available to, new drugs coming to market; government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients, pharmaceutical companies, payers, or other healthcare industry participants ( e.g. , limitations on advertising to physicians or required disclosure of payments made to them); or adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers, the pharmaceutical industry, or other healthcare companies that subscribe for our interactive services ( e.g. , changes in the design of health plans).
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Any of these changes could reduce the purchase of our services by such interactive services clients, reducing our revenue and possibly requiring us to materially revise our offerings.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In addition, our interactive services clients expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to services of the types we provide.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to clients and users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The market for healthcare in the U.S. is in the early stages of structural change and is rapidly evolving toward a more value-base care model.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client and user requirements, and sustain market acceptance.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our future financial performance will depend in part on growth in this market and on our ability to adapt to emerging demands of this market.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients or users.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients and users will want, while offering these services at competitive prices.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may lose clients and users.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients and users, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S7	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S8	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Failure to manage our growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have been experiencing a period of strong growth.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We believe that increasing awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread adoption of our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Promotional activities may not generate an increase in awareness or revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building awareness.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Besides awareness, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, service offering personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Failure to manage our growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; reduce client or user satisfaction; limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources and management attention from other projects, such as the development of new or enhanced services or the acquisition of suitable businesses or technologies.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	If we are unable to retain existing members of our Epocrates network and attract new members, especially physician members with desired characteristics for our interactive services who actively participate in those services, our revenue will decline, some of our business will suffer.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Members of our Epocrates network who subscribe to our premium drug and clinical reference products usually do so for a term of one year and may elect to cancel the subscription for any renewal terms.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Under certain circumstances, our members may cancel their subscriptions prior to expiration.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Factors that may affect the retention rate of our existing members and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools include:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Unless we are able to provide current, relevant, and reliable healthcare content, drug and clinical reference tools, formulary hosting, and other services that meet and continue to meet the needs of healthcare professionals, including physicians, the value of those services to new and existing members will decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our provision of such services depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified physician and pharmacist editors and authors, license accurate and relevant content from third parties, contract with health plans and insurers to host formulary information, monitor and respond to changes in member interest in specific topics, and develop new or enhanced services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we cannot meet our staffing needs or develop or acquire needed content at a reasonable cost, if there are errors or omissions in such content, if our competitors obtain exclusive access to or develop content that healthcare professionals consider superior to ours, or if we cannot meet the needs of our members, the value of our content and services would diminish.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The reputation of our Epocrates brand is dependent in large part on the medical community s continued perception of us as independent from our healthcare industry clients, particularly pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If healthcare professionals believe that we are too closely associated with such clients as a result of the revenue we receive from their purchase or sponsorship of our interactive services, the credibility of our brand will diminish.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We cannot assure you that the medical community will view our content as sufficiently unbiased.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If the reputation of our brand is damaged, it will be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to restore the quality of our brand with healthcare professionals and our business could suffer.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If the developers of mobile operating systems and mobile devices with which our products and services are compatible fail to remain competitive in the marketplace and to be adopted into medical practice and practice workflow, members will be less inclined to use our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing products and services, including mobile, web-based, and traditional products and services offered by competitors or through online resources and searches may affect our retention rate and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The availability of download sites such as the Apple App Store SM that offer numerous free or low-priced competing products at one location has also reduced the demand for our paid subscription products.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We expect the use of such sites to expand, reducing the number of paying members for our drug and clinical reference tools as a percentage of total members.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition to the loss of subscription revenue, our inability to attract or retain members, especially physician members with desired characteristics, such as specialty and prescribing habits, who update their mobile devices through our servers with sufficient frequency, may cause an even more significant decline in revenue from our interactive services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients are attracted to our large, engaged member network for the delivery of their clinical messages, formularies, and other sponsored content, and, without sufficient active members who meet desired criteria, those clients may reduce their subscription for our interactive services, and our revenue may decline.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Even if the number of our members is not materially reduced, their participation in our services may decrease, which could impact our revenues.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We have established limits on the number and the mix of sponsored and non-sponsored messages delivered to members in order to promote the quality of members experience with our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S8	If an insufficient number of members update during a given service period, or the demand for promotional clinical messaging sponsorship exceeds the available supply, our healthcare clients could become dissatisfied with our service.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S9	As a result, we may be unable to grow our interactive services revenue beyond the bounds we have set, as changes to such limits could cause our members to be dissatisfied with our services and the response to our interactive services to decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Furthermore, if our members generally become less responsive to participating in our services, the value of these interactive services will likely decline.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S11	This could cause our revenue to remain flat or to decline.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S12	Finally, if there is a reduction in the number of network members or their participation in our services, certain anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Epocrates, such as increased name recognition and reputation, cross-sell potential, and the market acceptance of joint services may not be fully realized, if at all.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S13	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S14	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S15	We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as access and use restrictions and other contractual provisions, to protect these rights.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S16	Our attempts to protect our intellectual property through copyright, patent, and trademark registration may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P12_S17	We have 15 issued U.S. patents, three issued foreign patents, and a number of U.S. patent applications pending as of December 31, 2016 .
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	insufficient to prevent competitors from providing products and services similar to ours, our patents may be successfully challenged, and we may not be able to obtain additional meaningful patent protection in the future.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our agreements with clients and users and with certain vendors and strategic partners limit their use of, and retain our rights in, our intellectual property and proprietary information and grant us ownership of intellectual property created in the performance of those agreements to the extent that it relates to the provision of our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, we require certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain of our vendors and strategic partners to agree to contract provisions regarding confidentiality and non-competition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	However, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Further, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in preventing the unauthorized access to, or use of, our proprietary information or the reverse engineering of our technology.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In any event, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technology or authoring clinical information that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or the information we distribute.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In addition, our platforms incorporate open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	For example, some open source licenses require that those using the associated code disclose modifications made to that code and that such modifications be licensed to third parties at no cost.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	There can be no assurance that efforts we take to monitor the use of open source software to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use, and we could lose the right to use technologies that are the subject of such claims.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients, partners, and third-party service providers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Indemnification obligations of our partners and third-party service providers may not be effective or adequate to protect us or the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S8	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology or information to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services; or that we would not need to change our product and design plans, which could require us to redesign affected products or services or delay new offerings.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including government agencies, patients of our clients, or stockholders.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	For example, in May 2013 we purchased the property on which our corporate headquarters are located.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	This property is a former Superfund site, and our ownership of it, or any of our other properties, could expose us to liability under applicable environmental laws, as well as to liability as a landlord or as owner of property that may be used by members of the public.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P20_S7	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS We depend upon third-party service providers for important functions of our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We depend upon third-party providers, and in some cases, limited or single-source providers, for important functions of our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For example, we rely on Access Healthcare Services USA, LLC to provide the majority of our data entry and certain other services, from facilities located in India and the Philippines, to support our client service operations, including, among other things, processing critical claims data and clinical documents, credentialing, and enrollment services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, we rely on our banking partner, U.S. Bank, for depositing client funds that we collect into our clients bank accounts.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Failure of these service providers to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation, and could disrupt our business operations, and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations where certain of our third-party service providers have facilities and operations also increases our risk.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	With respect to certain of our service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Although we have back-up functionality for some of these services, if we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources, and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S9	We depend on client satisfaction to succeed, both with respect to our cloud-based software and client support services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Our sales organization is dependent on the quality of our service offerings, our business reputation, and strong recommendations from existing clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S11	If our cloud-based software does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert claims against us or terminate their contracts with us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S12	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or retain clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S13	We provide client support services to resolve any issues related to our service offerings.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S14	Our client support team may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support, particularly as we increase the size of our client base.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S15	It is difficult to predict client demand for support services and if client demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S16	Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly-responsive client support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly-responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective clients, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S17	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S18	We conduct operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S19	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, unfavorable intellectual property protection, and pandemics.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P22_S20	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, client and user satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain clients and users, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In the foreign countries where we operate, local laws and customs may differ from those in the U.S.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	For example, it may be a local custom in certain countries for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which we refer to as the FCPA.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies from giving or offering money, gifts, or anything of value to a foreign official to obtain or retain business, and requires businesses to make and keep accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We cannot guarantee that our employees, contractors, and agents will comply with all of our FCPA compliance policies and procedures.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If we or our employees, contractors, or agents fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, government authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our continued growth.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Competition for such personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and software engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S10	In addition, our search for replacements for departed employees may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, impact employee hiring and retention, and adversely impact our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S11	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P23_S12	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Volatility in the price of our stock or failure to obtain stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under our equity plans may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we acquire or invest in companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions or investments, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, in 2015, we acquired Razor Insights, LLC, which we refer to as RazorInsights, a provider of cloud-based billing and EHR software services to rural and community hospitals, and purchased a suite of internally-developed clinical applications and an EHR system, which we refer to as webOMR, from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to accelerate our entry into the inpatient market.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We may not successfully use the webOMR technology to accelerate the development of our service offerings and integrate RazorInsights service offerings and realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, additional amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, any of which could harm our financial condition, operating results, or value of our common stock.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature in the short term, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower-than-expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer-than-expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S7	If the revenue of our clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Under most of our client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P28_S9	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government healthcare programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid or initiatives under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which we refer to as the ACA, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Also, although we currently estimate our expected client life for clients of athenahealth-branded services to be twelve years, this is only an estimate, and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S8	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated on 90 days notice without cause.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S9	The majority of our clinical information subscriptions have terms of one year, and our contracts with our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients for our interactive services typically range from one to three years.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S10	We cannot assure you that members of our Epocrates network and other Epocrates-branded services clients will continue to participate in our existing programs beyond the terms of their existing contracts or that they will enter into any additional contracts for new programs that we offer.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S11	If our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S12	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in various jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S13	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P29_S14	A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete on pricing with other vendors, and otherwise harm our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe that our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, we voluntarily approach state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the states in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of, taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles for our athenahealth services, and the uncertainty as to the timing of the fulfillment of our Epocrates services, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The sales cycle for our athenahealth services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution, although this period can be substantially longer.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated client life, currently 12 years, or the contract term.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Even if implementation has begun, there can be no assurance that we will recognize revenue on a timely basis or at all from our efforts.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Implementation for a given client may be canceled, as our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or no reason on 90 days notice.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, implementation may be delayed, or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future, for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S5	If implementation periods are extended, our provision of our athenahealth services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and expenses invested in the canceled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S7	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, the time between the date of the signing of the contract with a pharmaceutical client for a program, the actual fulfillment of the services under such contract and the revenue recognition associated with such revenues may be lengthy, especially for larger contracts with multiple deliverables, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including those that result from that client s need for internal approvals.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S8	These factors may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S9	As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S10	Because we recognize revenue from our drug and clinical reference tool subscriptions and certain of our interactive services over the term or at the end of the service period, a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results, which may make it more difficult to evaluate our prospects.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S11	We recognize revenue from our Epocrates subscription agreements monthly over the terms of these agreements, which are typically one year.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S12	In most cases, we recognize revenue from our interactive services over the terms of these agreements or upon delivery of each service element.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S13	As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from subscription and service agreements entered into during prior periods.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S14	Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions or service agreements in any one quarter may not materially affect our financial performance in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S15	In addition, we may be unable to adjust our costs, many of which are fixed, in response to reduced revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S16	Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our services may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make our reported results less indicative of our future prospects.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P33_S17	RISKS RELATED TO OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our applications from operating properly.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If our systems do not function reliably or fail to achieve user or client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us, and members could choose to terminate their use of our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients and members.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects or errors.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Errors may result from sources beyond our control, including the receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information; interface of our services with legacy systems that we did not develop; or errors in data provided by third parties.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients or members may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Therefore, despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes following introduction to the market.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	trial and error, so we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Because clients rely on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data, including information to assist providers in tracking and treating ill patients, and members rely on our services to provide timely and accurate information regarding medical conditions and medicines, they may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby give rise to a product liability claim or errors or omissions claim.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Such claims could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of those claims.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Limitations of liability and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software or content which we may include in our subscription and services agreements may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from related claims.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In most cases, we maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In light of this, defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share; liability to clients, members, their patients, or others; failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion; diversion of development and management resources; delays in the introduction of new services; injury to our reputation; and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients or members from purchasing services from us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P36_S6	If our security measures are breached or fail or unauthorized access is obtained to a client s or member s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients and members may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our services involve the web-based storage and transmission of clients and members proprietary information, including personal or identifying information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce client confidence and require substantial resources to address.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client, member, or patient data.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely upon users of our systems for key activities to promote security of those systems and the data within them, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	On occasion, our users have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Failure of users to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales, clients, and members.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	In addition, we use third-party technology and service providers, and our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their patients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S6	For example, we depend on third-party service providers for processing claims data and clinical documents for our clients and we partner with other healthcare information technology companies to offer our clients more seamless integration with those companies through electronic interfaces.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Vendor management programs and processes for assessment of our partners' information security which we have designed cannot provide absolute security.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our clients may have their own computer systems (whether internally developed or provided by a third party) to manage, store, and transmit clinical and financial data, which may interact with or contain information obtained from our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because we do not control our vendors , partners , or clients information security systems, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of these systems.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	A security breach of our vendors , partners , or clients system may damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to cancel their contracts, subject us to third-party lawsuits, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S6	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Various events could interrupt users access to our systems, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S8	The ability to access our systems is critical to our clients administration of care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) terrorism and acts of war; (iv) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our systems or those of others; and (v) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our systems or those of others.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S10	We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S11	If users access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to those clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S12	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely in part upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S13	Our business interruption insurance only covers some, but not all, of these potential events, and even for those events that are covered, it may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events, including, for example, loss of market share and diminution of our brand, reputation, and member and client loyalty.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S14	In addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S15	Some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S16	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S17	We rely on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users or clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S18	In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we serve our clients primarily from third-party data-hosting facilities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S19	These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S20	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S21	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S22	Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S23	Our ability to deliver our internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P40_S24	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable internet access and services and reliable mobile device, telephone, facsimile, and pager systems.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment or service providers, to provide our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users or clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and clients, adversely affect our brands and business, and expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The insurance coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The reliability and performance of the internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet-based services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Features and safeguards we have implemented to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims, which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, members, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our software, content, and services are used to assist clinical decision-making and provide information about patient medical histories, treatment plans, medical conditions, and the use of particular medications.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, members, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our athenaClinicals service is utilized in clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Therefore, if these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us by clients, clinicians, patients, or others.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	We often have little control over data accuracy, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our Epocrates clinical reference tools and interactive services provide healthcare professionals with access to clinical information, including information regarding particular medical conditions and the use of particular medications.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, or we introduce inaccuracies in the process of implementing third-party content, it is possible that patients, physicians, consumers, the providers of the third-party content, or others may sue us if they are harmed as a result of such inaccuracies.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content, and we have had content errors in the past.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages; have our members assume responsibility for medical oversight and dosing decisions; and require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, or changes to existing laws and regulations, including the potential amendment or repeal of all or parts of the ACA as a result of the recent U.S. presidential election, could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information and interactive services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate, particularly as we develop and release new and more sophisticated products and services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Some of the risks we face from healthcare regulation are described below: False or Fraudulent Claim Laws .
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that prohibit submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In some cases, these laws also prohibit abuse in connection with such submission and payment.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S6	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S7	CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to engage in or overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S8	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software and services relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P51_S10	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to those clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations .
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In particular, HIPAA includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity subject to HIPAA.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In addition, our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	access by the HHS to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it (including the omnibus rule promulgated in January 2013) have provided clarification of certain aspects of both the privacy and security rules issued under HIPAA, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the security rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In addition, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, which we refer to as ONCHIT, is coordinating the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the healthcare sector.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P55_S4	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P55_S5	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, and their interpretations are no less stringent than ours, we seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our clients, and since we do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of those clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Among our services, we provide automated reminder services to patients, internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and other personally identifiable information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition to false claims and HIPAA requirements, we are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to healthcare providers and patients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	For example, the federal healthcare programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws prohibit bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Legislation relating to payments to physicians .
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Legislation enacted or pending in several states and enacted at the federal level as part of the ACA and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 mandates public disclosure of, or otherwise regulates or limits the providing of, certain gifts and payments by pharmaceutical companies to physicians.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	These laws may be interpreted to cover honorarium payments made to physicians for participation in market research activities sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Because we currently provide market research services involving participants from our member network, the increased adoption and enforcement of these laws and the application of any public disclosure requirements or other limitations may have a negative impact on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to sponsor these activities or the willingness of physicians to participate in the market research.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P61_S4	We cannot predict how pharmaceutical companies or physicians will respond when such legislation becomes more widespread or becomes effective at the federal level.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P61_S5	A significant decline in the sponsorship of our market research services by pharmaceutical companies or the agencies that represent such companies, or a significant decline in physicians willingness to participate in such studies could negatively impact our operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with healthcare providers.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal anti-referral laws the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practice clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P62_S4	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws .
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P64_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our practice clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our service fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	States have differing prescription format requirements, and, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Regulatory authorities such as the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Any determination that we or our practice clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P66_S4	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	As a company that provides EHR functionality, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The software component of our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2014 Edition compliant Complete EHR by an ONC-ATCB in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the HHS.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We cannot be certain that our system will meet future requirements.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of medical practice claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	To the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our practice clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for healthcare services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and time frames may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by practice clients.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities from practicing medicine.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We employ and contract with physicians who provide only medical information to our users, some of whom may be consumers, and we do not intend to provide medical care or advice.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Any determination that we are a healthcare provider and acted improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Regulation of drug and medical device advertising and promotion .
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We provide services involving promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Any increase in regulation of these areas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA; the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC; or other governmental bodies at the federal, state, or local level, could make it more difficult for us to contract for certain of our interactive services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Physician groups and others have criticized the FDA s current policies and have called for restrictions on advertising of prescription drugs and for increased FDA enforcement.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In response, the FDA has conducted hearings and sought public comment regarding its regulation of information concerning drugs on the internet and the relationships between pharmaceutical companies and those disseminating information on drugs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We cannot predict what actions the FDA or industry participants may take in response to these criticisms.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P75_S3	It is also possible that new laws would be enacted that impose restrictions on such marketing and advertising.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Our interactive services revenues could be materially reduced by additional restrictions on the marketing or advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices, whether imposed by law or regulation or by policies adopted by industry members.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If the FDA, the FTC, or another governmental body finds that any information available on our website or distributed by us violates FDA, FTC, or other laws or regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state s consumer protection statutes or other new or existing laws.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The FDA has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, in February 2011 the FDA issued a final rule regarding regulation of Medical Device Data Systems, or MDDS, which are systems that are intended to transfer, store, convert, or display medical device data.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	While EHRs are expressly exempted from the final rule, it is possible that future changes in our services could involve the transfer, storage, conversion, or display of medical device data.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In April 2014, a draft report developed by the FDA, ONCHIT, and the Federal Communications Commission, was released proposing a regulatory framework for health information technology for the purpose of promoting innovation, protecting patient safety, and avoiding regulatory duplication.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	To the extent that our software is considered a medical device under the policy or an MDDS under the final rule, or is the subject of additional regulation promulgated as a result of the report, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing software development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and client service providers, for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Due to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to government regulation unrelated to healthcare.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	While our services are primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to healthcare, certain aspects of those services may require us to comply with regulatory schemes from other areas.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Examples of such regulatory schema include: Anti-spam Laws .
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P83_S3	We may be required to comply with current or future anti-spam legislation by limiting or modifying some of our interactive services, such as our clinical messaging, which may result in a reduction in our revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	One such law, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM, became effective in the United States on January 1, 2004.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	CAN-SPAM imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with the sending of commercial e-mail.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	CAN-SPAM or similar laws may impose burdens on our member communication practices and on certain of our services, which in turn could harm our ability to attract new payer and pharmaceutical clients and increase revenues.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Our national cloud-based network allows us access to cost and pricing data for a large number of providers in most regional markets, as well as to the contracted rates for third-party payers.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	To the extent that our services enable providers to compare their cost and pricing data with those of their competitors, those providers could collude to increase the pricing for their services, to reduce the compensation they pay their employees, or to collectively negotiate agreements with third parties.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Similarly, if payers are able to compare their contracted rates of payment to providers, those payers may seek to reduce the amounts they might otherwise pay.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Such actions may be deemed to be anti-competitive and a violation of federal antitrust laws.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P85_S6	To the extent that we are deemed to have enabled such activities, we could be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice or the FTC and be required to curtail or terminate the services that permitted such collusion.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	As a billing service that offers patient communication and registration services, our employees or those of our service providers may from time to time come into contact with patients who owe our clients outstanding amounts.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Communications with patients that relate to amounts owed may be deemed to subject us or our service providers to federal or state debt collection laws and regulations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Such laws and regulations, if deemed to apply to us, could require registration with government agencies and compliance with significant administrative obligations ( e.g. , to maintain an in-state office with local employees), which could result in increased expenses and subject us to fines and penalties for violation.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Following the disclosure in 2012 of the methods used by debt collector Accretive Health to obtain payment of amounts owed by patients to one of its hospital clients, heightened focus on debt collection practices may lead to additional regulation and greater scrutiny of existing debt collection practices.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use, and dissemination of data, and the presentation of website or other electronic content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security, and access.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Courts may also adopt these developing standards.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	A number of states, including California, have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the release of credit card or other personal information received from consumers.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	In addition, several foreign governments have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P88_S2	For example, the European Union, or EU, adopted the Data Protection Directive, or DPD, imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information online.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P88_S3	The DPD provides for specific regulations requiring all non-EU countries doing business with EU member states to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Canada s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Foreign governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities, and our practice management services for practices along the Canadian border and our market research services could each involve the personal information of foreign residents.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Furthermore, in the conduct of our market research activities outside of the United States, we rely upon a third party to identify and recruit respondents for the market research and to comply with the applicable privacy laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S3	We cannot assure you that this third party will successfully comply with such laws or that we would not be responsible for any failure of this third party to comply.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S4	We cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S5	Whether and how existing local and international privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the internet and other online technologies is still uncertain and may take years to resolve.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S6	Privacy laws and regulations, if drafted or interpreted broadly, could be deemed to apply to the technology we use and could restrict our information collection methods or decrease the amount and utility of the information that we would be permitted to collect.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S7	The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or services, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S8	In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices, or those of our agents, do not meet these standards could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S9	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S10	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S11	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S12	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P89_S13	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Other relationships permit third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S3	In each of these cases, we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S4	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided, as well as the channel relationships themselves, may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S5	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S6	Any misconduct by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients, any failure to follow contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S7	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S8	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require a costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and adversely affect our business.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S9	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S10	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P91_S11	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand if we do not participate in such programs.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S3	In the past few years, various entities and federal programs have provided subsidies for services similar to ours, including EHR initiatives.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S4	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to qualify for and participate in such subsidy programs in the future.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S5	To the extent that we do not participate in such programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S6	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S7	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P92_S8	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P93_S5	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	the ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our by-laws.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P94_S2	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S2	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S3	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, stockholders ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S4	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S5	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S6	Therefore, investors are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_17_ITEM1A_P95_S7	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.

1131096_17_ITEM5_P30_S0	APPROACH TO SCHEDULING C.E. Floyd Company has developed the baseline schedule based on input from the design team, direction from the Owner, input from subcontractors and through detailed study of the construction documents and sequence required to execute the work most efficiently.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P30_S1	The Baseline Schedule and it s WBS s will be broken down into more detailed Breakout Schedules through detailed schedule and sequence review meetings with trade subcontractors.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P30_S2	The baseline Schedule will be updated on a monthly basis or more if required to accurately track the progress of the project.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P30_S3	Updates will be based on activities start dates, completion dates and percent complete calculations.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P30_S4	Along with Baseline and Breakout Schedules C.E. Floyd will utilize the use of 3 Week Look Ahead Schedules developed by our Project Superintendent to schedule and track activities on a day to day and week to week basis.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P31_S0	C.E. Floyd Company plans to work from North to South with soil excavation, foundations and precast.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P31_S1	We plan to sequence in the other trades as shown through our start to start with positive lag relationships.

1131096_17_ITEM5_P36_S0	PROJECT CALENDAR The Baseline Schedule is based on an 8 hour-5 day work week with the 6 standard Federal Holiday s shown as non-work days.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P36_S1	Basic winter conditions have been taken into account by allowing for 7 days as non-work days thru the months of December, January, February and March.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P36_S2	This is the same basis the Breakout Schedules would be created with.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P36_S3	The Project baseline schedule and Breakout Schedules will also be created with the ability to assign separate calendars to individual activities to show constraints that the activity might have such as spring and fall plantings, backfill requirements and Town restrictions, however no such calendars have been added at this time.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P36_S4	We will also have the ability to impose more stringent scheduling requirements to activities that may fall behind schedule such as 10 hour-6 day work week.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P36_S5	Activity calendars that change during the course of schedule updating are identified on each schedule update narrative.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P37_S0	We have some constraints within the baseline schedule most of which are in the DD and Municipal WBS s based on town requirements.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P38_S0	Three activities within the Construction WBS have start constraints.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P38_S1	Those activities are A1130, A5280 and A6090 all of which are based on an anticipated status of the precast erection at those dates.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P38_S2	We have 210 activities and 326 relationships.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P38_S3	We have tried to minimize lag but where required to accurately show concurrent activities we have start to start relationships with positive lag.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P39_S0	We have not allocated or tied any activities to resources at this time and we do not plan to at any point during the project.
1131096_17_ITEM5_P40_S0	SCHEDULE UPDATE NOTES Proposal Schedule no activities or calendars updated.

1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview athenahealth, Inc. ( athenahealth, the Company, we, or our ) partners with hospital and ambulatory clients to drive clinical and financial results.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	We offer network-based medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services, as well as Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our network provides clients better insight across their own organization as well as the ability to learn from the experience of every other provider on the network.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	Through our model, we infuse the knowledge clients need to thrive in a changing industry directly into their workflow, from clinical guidelines to payer rules.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	We take on back-office work at scale so providers can focus on patients, not paperwork.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S5	We deliver the majority of our service offerings through a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S6	Our model combines a cloud-based network, knowledge, and back-office work, which we refer to as network, knowledge, and work, to help healthcare providers leverage technology to automate certain back-office tasks, assist at the point of care, and adapt to changes in government regulatory schemes or billing requirements of payers.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S7	We believe that including our clients on the same instance of software creates a network effect that enables each client to benefit from the collective experience of other clients.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P2_S8	As our network grows, we believe these benefits also expand and accrue to the benefit of all of our clients on the network.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	athenaNet acts as a conduit for the exchange of information among clients, payers, trading partners, and our own experienced team.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	It enables us to learn continuously, innovate with agility, and deliver near-instant updates that we believe rapidly improve performance.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	This work ranges from receiving, scanning, and delivering faxes to tracking claims with payers and managing denials.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	We automate this work whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work at massive scale with our internal team.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	The knowledge we gain from doing work for our clients and discovering ways to improve their performance is culled, curated, and captured within athenaNet through mechanisms that include a patented billing rules engine and clinical quality management engine.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S6	Using this knowledge, we also proactively coach our clients on best practices to help improve their performance.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S7	As we work with clients, payers, and other industry trading partners, more knowledge is infused into each service, which we believe makes athenaNet "smarter" and more powerful for our clients.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P3_S8	This unique combination of network, knowledge, and work is fundamental to our service model and value proposition to clients.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , we generated revenue of $1,082.9 million , primarily from the sale of our services, compared to $924.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $752.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have also increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our revenue is predominately derived from core athenahealth-branded business services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	In most cases, we charge clients a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients, connecting our financial results directly to those of our clients and our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Therefore, the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians and other healthcare providers working within our client accounts, the collections of these physicians and providers, and the number of services purchased.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	To provide these services, we incur expenses in several categories, including cost of revenue, selling and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expense.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P5_S4	In general, our cost of revenue increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our intended growth rate of adding new accounts to our network of medical groups and hospital clients.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P5_S5	Our research and development and general and administrative expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future and our overall business management activities.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P5_S6	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity and to ensure adherence to related financial covenants.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained, and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and assumptions, and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	Additionally, we may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P6_S6	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies, as they require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	All revenue, other than initial implementation and provider adds revenue, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the client, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	We derive the majority of our revenue from business services associated with our integrated, network-enabled services and from subscriptions to and sponsored clinical information and decision support services for our point of care medical application.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Our integrated services consist of medical billing and practice management; electronic health record, or EHR; patient engagement; order transmission and care coordination; and population health management, which are supported by our network, athenaNet.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year service contracts related to our integrated, network-enabled services that renew automatically.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days' notice without cause.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in the same timeframe.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, typically based upon a percentage of collections posted to our network; minimum fees; flat fees; or per-claim fees, where applicable.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	We do not recognize revenue for business services until these collections are posted, as the fees are not fixed or determinable until such time.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the subsequent month.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	For most of our clients, amounts due are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Determining whether and when some of our revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied often involves judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period related to certain non-refundable, upfront fees associated with our integrated network-enabled services requires management to make estimates and judgments on the expected client life.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	We determined the expected client life considering the following key factors: - Renewal rate considerations - Economic life of the service The expected client life, or expected performance period, for the years presented is 12 years.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Multiple element arrangements, which are single arrangements that contain more than one offering or deliverable that results in more than one unit of accounting, require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	We maintain a standard price list by service; however, certain incentives, such as discounts, may be offered to clients.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Due to the variability in the value of the discount offered for individual services sold on a stand-alone basis across multiple contracts, we have not been able to conclude that a consistent number of stand-alone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments is reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our method to establish our BESP, including our model and our assumptions, may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	For example, if our BESP is too high or too low for an individual element of an arrangement, the amount of revenue recognized within each reporting period would be inaccurate.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	The amount of deferred revenue associated with separable deliverables subject to our established BESP is $17.6 million and $23.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our estimate of the expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P17_S4	For example, if, in the future, we need to increase our expected performance period to a period longer than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P17_S5	On the other hand, if, in the future, we need to decrease our expected performance period to a period shorter than 12 years, the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The amount of deferred revenue related to initial implementation and provider add fees is $57.0 million and $62.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Description Judgment and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Subscriptions to the Epocrates point of care medical application are entered into by members via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable subscription code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Payment associated with these subscription fees occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed; such payments are therefore recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	These fees are recognized ratably once activated over the contracted subscription term.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	If a subscription code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Sponsored clinical information and decision support service clients are charged a fee for the service or group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit if the delivered item or items have value to the client on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	We allocate arrangement consideration to each unit or element of the arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a client, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the client.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Other services consist primarily of tenant-based operating lease revenue, which is straight-lined over the term of the lease.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	When we cannot establish VSOE, we determine if we can establish third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	TPE is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable deliverables when sold separately.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	Our services differ significantly from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of offerings with similar functionality cannot be obtained.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor offerings selling prices are on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P23_S4	Therefore, we are unable to determine TPE.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Since VSOE and TPE do not exist, we use our best estimate of the selling price, or BESP, to establish the relative selling value and to allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	We determine BESP for a service by performing an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that service, which takes into account market conditions, competitive landscape, and pricing practices.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Business Combinations, including purchased intangible assets, are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Measurement period adjustments relate to information that we should have known at the time of acquisition; these adjustments and any other changes to purchase accounting are included in earnings in the current period.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant s viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually on November 30 th or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets and the fair value of the reporting unit during goodwill impairment tests include, but are not limited to, identifying reporting units, historical and projected client retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired clients, expected future cash outflows, the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, estimated useful lives of these intangible assets, and a probability-weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Significant judgment in testing goodwill for impairment includes the assessment of the number of reporting units, and also includes assigning assets and liabilities to the reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit based on management s best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Management s best estimates and assumptions are employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets, which are finite-lived assets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $240.7 million and $112.1 million, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $229.2 million and $126.2 million, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	All of our software is considered internal use for accounting purposes, as we do not market or sell our software.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	As a result, we capitalize certain costs associated with the creation of internally-developed software for internal use (i.e., athenaNet).
1131096_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	These costs are recorded in the Capitalized Software Costs line on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of athenaNet services and other internally-developed software for internal use.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Costs incurred during the application development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable that the development will result in new or additional functionality.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), as well as external consultant fees for individuals working on these projects.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Capitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life when the asset has been placed in service.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Significant judgments related to the capitalization of internal use software costs include determining whether it is probable that projects will result in new or additional functionality; concluding on when the application development phase starts and ends; and estimating which costs, especially employee compensation costs, should be capitalized.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Additionally, there is judgment applied to the useful lives of these capitalized costs; we have concluded that the useful life for capitalized internally-developed software ranges from two to five years.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	We account for costs associated with internal-use software on a project-by-project basis during initial capitalization as well as subsequent measurement.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	While we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments is reasonable, actual results could differ, and such differences could lead to an increase or decrease in expenses in the current period.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts of internally-developed capitalized software were $95.6 million and $70.0 million, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	Note that these totals exclude acquired third-party software licenses for internal use.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We partner with hospital and ambulatory clients to drive clinical and financial results.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	We derive our revenue from two sources: business services, and implementation and other services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Business services primarily consists of revenue from our athenaNet providers who use our network-enabled medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	Business services also includes revenue from Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	No single client accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	Business services revenue accounted for 97% , 96% , and 95% of our total revenues the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	Business services revenue for athenahealth-branded services is typically 2% to 8% of a practice s or health system s total collections depending upon the services purchased, the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice or health system.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P39_S7	Accordingly, business services revenue is largely driven by: the number of healthcare providers (collectively, healthcare providers ) we serve, the number of physicians and other healthcare providers working in those practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those healthcare providers, the mix of our services used by those medical practices and healthcare providers, and our contracted rates.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level and service mix of healthcare providers.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Typically, discretionary use of healthcare provider services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our healthcare provider clients about 30 to 50 days later.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Our pharmaceutical clients budgeting process impacts the timing of revenue related to sales of sponsored clinical information and decision support services associated with our mobile applications, which has historically been highest in the fourth quarter.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Additionally, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses, as well as significant regulatory changes that are implemented during a fiscal year.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	While we believe that the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses will continue to impact collections by our healthcare provider clients, there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Implementation and other revenue consists of all of our non-core revenue streams, and includes the amortization of deferred revenue on implementation services, as well as third-party operating lease-based tenant revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	We expect the amortization of deferred implementation fees to decline, as we began including implementation fees in our ongoing monthly rate in 2014.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Additionally, we expect third-party tenant revenue to decline in the foreseeable future as tenants vacate and we occupy the previously rented space at our corporate headquarters.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	During 2016, we adopted a change in presentation on our consolidated statements of income in order to present a gross profit line and allocate certain overhead expenses, the presentation of which is consistent with our peers.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Under the new presentation, we began allocating overhead expenses including occupancy charges, depreciation, and amortization of capitalized software.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	Prior periods have been revised to reflect this change in presentation.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Cost of revenue (formerly presented as direct operating expense) primarily consists of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) related to personnel who provide services, including implementation of new clients, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing arrangements and clearing house, claim processing costs, certain overhead costs, depreciation of certain fixed assets, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	We expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	We include in cost of revenue all service costs incurred to fulfill our client contracts and costs associated with third-party tenant and other non-core revenues.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	We expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation with higher volumes of work in particular functions, geographies, and medical specialties.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	Although we expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future, cost of revenue is expected to decline as a percentage of revenue as we increase automation.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Selling and marketing expense primarily consists of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for selling and marketing employees and marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and online initiatives), certain overhead costs, depreciation of certain fixed assets, and also includes amortization related to certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and an additional portion at the time our services commence.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our selling and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	We expect to continue to increase our investment in selling and marketing by hiring additional personnel and investing in marketing campaigns to increase our access to healthcare provider organizations, as well as increase the awareness of athenahealth in the marketplace.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	expense will increase in absolute terms.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	As we begin to leverage lower cost sales channels, we expect selling and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Research and development expense primarily consists of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for research and development employees, consulting fees for third-party developers, certain overhead costs, and depreciation of certain fixed assets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	We expect that, in the near-term, research and development expenditures will increase in absolute terms and will likely remain constant as a percentage of revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services; however, the amount of expenditures that should be capitalized as software costs versus expensed as research and development could vary based on the specific projects we undertake.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	General and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for administrative employees, outside professional fees for accountants, lawyers, and consultants, certain overhead expenses, and depreciation of certain fixed assets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms as we make investments to support our growth.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Interest expense primarily consists of interest costs related to our term and revolving loans under our current credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing fees.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Other (expense) income consists of various expense and income items that are not part of our core business activities.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, other (expense) income consists primarily of gains realized from the sale of marketable securities.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	We previously invested a total of $1.1 million in Castlight Health, Inc., or Castlight, a provider of cloud-based software that enables enterprises to control healthcare costs.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	This investment was initially recorded at cost.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	On March 14, 2014, an initial public offering, or IPO, of shares of Castlight s Class B common stock was made available for sale on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CSLT.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	As a result of the IPO, we marked the shares we held to market based on quoted market prices.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	As of December 31, 2015, all shares held in Castlight had been sold.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Income tax (provision) benefit relates to federal and state jurisdictions in the United States and India.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory tax rate is mainly related to the amount of research and development credits we generate through the development of our new and enhanced services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	We expect that in the near-term our effective tax rate will continue to be volatile due to the increase in research and development spend, as well as the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with adopting the new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation, as we discuss in the next paragraph.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	Under this guidance, a company recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	ASU 2016-09 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods; however, early adoption is permitted.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	We have evaluated ASU 2016-09 and believe that when we adopt this standard for January 1, 2017, our effective tax rate going forward will be impacted.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Also, upon adoption, we will recognize our previously unrecognized excess tax benefits using the modified retrospective transition method, which will result in a cumulative-effect increase of $49.2 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	In addition, upon adoption, we no longer intend to calculate an estimate of expected forfeitures and will begin to recognize forfeitures as they occur, which will result in a cumulative-effect increase of $1.0 million to retained earnings with the offset to decrease additional paid-in capital.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	ASU 2016-02 most significantly impacts lessee accounting and disclosures.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	First, this guidance requires lessees to identify arrangements that should be accounted for as leases.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Under ASU 2016-02, for lease arrangements exceeding a 12-month term, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation is recorded by the lessee for all leases, whether operating or financing, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases and amortization/interest expense for financing leases.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The balance sheet amount recorded for existing leases at the date of adoption of ASU 2016-02 must be calculated using the applicable incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	In addition, ASU 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	We anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as all long-term leases will be capitalized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	We intend to early adopt this standard effective January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	ASU 2014-09, which was issued in March 2014 and has been codified with the Accounting Standards Codification as Topic 606, is now effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	In addition, ASC 606 provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including, but not limited to, when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	ASC 606 provides companies with two implementation methods.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application).
1131096_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Since ASU 2014-09 was issued, several additional ASUs have been issued and incorporated within ASC 606 to clarify various elements of the guidance.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	We anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements with respect to the capitalization of costs of commissions, upfront costs, and other contract acquisition-based and contract fulfillment costs on our consolidated balance sheets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	We are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, including the impact to the pattern with which we recognize revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 :
1131096_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Percentages for each line item may not sum to the totals or subtotals for each fiscal year due to rounding.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	The increase in business services revenue was primarily driven by the growth in the number of providers using our services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	The increase in the number of providers was as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	(a) As of December 31, 2016, we refined our definition of providers to include additional provider types such as behavioral interventionists and certified physician assistants.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	Under the new definition, there were 96,542 total providers as of December 31, 2016.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	We will utilize this new number and definition in future filings.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these providers.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P66_S4	The amount of collections processed was as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Cost of revenue increased primarily due to compensation costs, which increased $33.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 , as a result of a 22% increase in headcount from December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	We increased headcount due to the increase in the number of providers added to the network and the expansion of our emerging services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, amortization expense increased $13.3 million due to an increase in new software functionality that we placed in service, such as certain projects associated with athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems, in the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	Finally, cost of revenue increased $6.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 due to our investment in various software subscriptions necessary to support our clients and our operations.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Selling and marketing expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to increases in compensation costs and consulting fees.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase in compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.9 million, and was largely due to a 15% increase in headcount that was partially offset by a lower increase in variable compensation from December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	The increase in consulting fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.3 million.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	We hired additional sales personnel and utilized consultants to focus on adding new clients and increasing penetration within new and existing markets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Research and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to compensation costs and allocated amortization expense.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	Compensation costs increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to restructuring costs incurred for strategic re-alignment purposes during the three months ended December 31, 2016.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	In addition, research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by a $6.2 million increase in amortization expense related to capitalized software projects that were ultimately decided not to be placed in service.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P69_S3	General and administrative expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to professional services fees and compensation costs.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P69_S4	General and administrative expense was impacted by an increase of $5.8 million in professional service fees, which include legal and consulting fees.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P69_S5	General and administrative expense was also impacted by a $3.7 million increase in facilities-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 , largely due to our growth.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Other (expense) income primarily relates to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and gains realized from the sale of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 , is primarily due to the increase in our research and development tax credits.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in business services revenue was primarily driven by the growth in the number of physicians and providers using our services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	The increases in the number of physicians and providers using our revenue cycle and practice management service, EHR service, and patient engagement service are as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these physicians and providers.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	The amount of collections posted was as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cost of revenue increased primarily due to compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased $37.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 , as a result of a 28% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	We increased headcount due to the increase in number of providers added to the network, as well as to start a go-live support team, during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	In addition, amortization expense increased $20.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in new functionality that we placed in service.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	Finally, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing and clearing house activities increased $14.2 million, as the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P74_S4	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients are as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Selling and marketing expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to increases in compensation costs and miscellaneous selling and marketing-related costs.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The increase in compensation costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 , was $25.0 million, and was largely due to a 15% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	We hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new clients and increasing penetration within new and existing markets.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Additionally, other general selling and marketing-related costs increased $15.3 million (including increases in online media of $8.2 million and offline media of $2.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, which increased $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , largely due to a 34% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	The additional research and development personnel were necessary in order to maintain our investment in technology, to upgrade and expand our service offerings, and to develop new technologies.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	General and administrative expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and lease termination costs.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S5	Compensation costs increased $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , largely due to a 23% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S6	Additionally, general and administrative expense increased $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to lease termination costs incurred as a result of our growth and evolving strategy.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P76_S7	In the year ended December 31, 2015 , income from governmental bodies increased $3.0 million, which offset general and administrative expense, due to our participation in incentive programs.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Other (income) expense increased due to gains realized from the sale of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 , is primarily due to discrete items, specifically, the sale of marketable securities.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity As of December 31, 2016 , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $147.4 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of $141.9 million as of December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we have outstanding indebtedness of $292.5 million compared to $300.0 million as of December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	On May 5, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which we refer to as the 2015 Credit Agreement, which provided for a $500.0 million senior credit facility consisting of a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	We had $200.0 million available on the unsecured revolving credit facility as of both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	We may increase the revolving credit facility up to an additional $100.0 million and may increase the term loan facility to the extent that such amount will not cause us to be in breach of our financial covenants (such as compliance with a consolidated fixed charge coverage, consolidated leverage, and consolidated senior leverage ratios), subject to certain conditions, including obtaining lender commitments.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S4	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility matures on May 5, 2020, although we may prepay the 2015 Senior Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S5	As of December 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with our covenants under the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S6	We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to make payments on our contractual obligations, to invest in the development of functionality and new services, and to purchase property and equipment in the foreseeable future.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S7	In addition, our 2015 Senior Credit Facility will provide additional flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives in the future, if needed.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S8	Our analysis is supported by the growth in our new client base and a high rate of renewal with our existing clients, as well as the corresponding increase in billings and collections.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P80_S9	There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under these credit facilities or obtain additional financing.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Commitments We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the 2017 fiscal year.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Operating Cash Flow Activities Net income after non-cash and reclassification adjustments contributed an additional $64.9 million to cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase in non-cash and reclassification adjustments was the result of a $24.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2016 and a $28.7 million gain on the sale of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	The increase in net income after non-cash and reclassification adjustments was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by working capital of $46.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	accrued compensation due to the timing of payments.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	In 2014, we began including implementation fees in our ongoing monthly rate as part of our go to market strategy, which resulted in a decrease in deferred revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 , as 2016 required less cash for acquired third party licenses and business acquisitions.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we acquired Filament Labs, Inc. (doing business as Patient IO) for $15.2 million (included in the payments on acquisitions, net of cash acquired line on the consolidated statements of cash flows).
1131096_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	This activity contrasts with our acquisition of Razor Insights, LLC (included in the payments on acquisitions, net of cash acquired line on the consolidated statements of cash flows) and our purchase of WebOMR (a third party license included in the capitalized software costs line on the consolidated statements of cash flows) in the year ended December 31, 2015 for $39.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Net cash used in investing activities also decreased due to $29.8 million of cash provided from the sales of Castlight stock in the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition, net cash used for property, plant and equipment additions decreased $18.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher spend, particularly in building improvements, in the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	We expect to continue to increase our investment in capitalized software costs as we develop new and enhance existing services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	The variance in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $105.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to net proceeds received from the 2015 Senior Credit Facility in the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that income taxes paid for the net settlement of restricted stock unit awards will be greater than the cash received for stock option exercises due to our stock price and the increase in the issuance of restricted stock units compared to stock options.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Operating Cash Flow Activities Net income after non-cash and reclassification adjustments contributed an additional $21.9 million to cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	The non-cash adjustments were driven by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $24.2 million related to our growth, which was offset by $28.7 million in gains from the sales of Castlight stock.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	Additionally, there was a decrease in cash provided by working capital of $7.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily driven by the bonus accrual related to headcount growth.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $71.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily due to our acquisition of RazorInsights for $39.9 million, net of cash acquired, which is included in the payments for acquisitions line, and an increase of $44.3 million in capitalized software costs, which includes our purchase of webOMR for $22.0 million.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S4	We expect to continue to increase our investment in capitalized software costs as we develop new and enhance existing services.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S5	Note that in 2015 we had cash spend of $ 97.8 million related to capitalized software.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S6	The cash spend consisted of $84.4 million related to internally-developed software, including the $22.0 million webOMR asset acquisition, while the remaining $13.3 million related to acquired software licenses.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S7	We increased our investments in property and equipment in 2015 by $11.1 million , primarily related to investments in computer equipment to support our data centers and continued improvements to our owned properties, as well as expansion in our leased facilities.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S8	Net cash used in investing activities was offset by $29.8 million of cash provided from the sales of Castlight stock.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S9	Financing Cash Flow Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily due to $106.3 million of net proceeds received from the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P89_S10	For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that income taxes paid for the net settlement of restricted stock unit awards will be greater than the cash received for stock option exercises due to the stock price, as well as the Company's current preference to issue restricted stock units instead of stock options.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 :
1131096_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	(1) We have cash interest requirements due on the 2015 Senior Credit Facility payable at variable rates which are not included in the above table.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	(2) We are party to agreements for non-cancelable operating leases for office space and data centers which expire between 2017 and 2030.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	(3) Other consists of uncertain tax benefits.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	We have not recognized these uncertain tax benefits, nor do we have an expectation of when these uncertain tax benefits would be challenged.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P91_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Other than our operating leases, which are primarily for office space and data centers, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues are generated outside of the United States.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	None of our vendor relationships, including our contracts with our offshore service providers for work performed in India and the Philippines, is denominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 , approximately 1-2% of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in India, and were incurred in Indian rupees.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We therefore do not believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is likely.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We had $292.5 million and $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2015 Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility bears interest at the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an interest margin based on (i) our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	A one hundred basis point change in the interest rate on our borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 would result in an annual change in interest expense of $2.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we utilized an interest rate swap to manage exposure to interest rates on the variable rate of our indebtedness.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We designated our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The interest rate swap expired in August 2016.
1131096_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , we do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and we have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future.
1131096_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are located beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2016 (the Evaluation Date ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934).
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

1131096_17_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In conducting this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2016 , our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Changes in Internal Control There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the three months ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of athenahealth, Inc.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P4_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P5_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1131096_17_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 2, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1131096_17_ITEM15_P5_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P5_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

1131096_17_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P6_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P6_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P6_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of athenahealth, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1131096_17_ITEM15_P12_S1	We offer network-based medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services, as well as Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P12_S2	Our network provides clients better insight across their own organization as well as the ability to learn from the experience of every other provider on the network.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P12_S3	Through our model, we infuse the knowledge clients need to thrive in a changing industry directly into their workflow, from clinical guidelines to payer rules.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P12_S4	We take on back office work at scale so providers can focus on patients, not paperwork.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P12_S5	Our clients largely consist of medical group practices ranging in size throughout the United States of America.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P13_S0	We consider events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P13_S1	Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of issuance of these financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P13_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

1131096_17_ITEM15_P13_S4	Presentation During 2016, we adopted a change in presentation on our consolidated statements of income in order to present a gross profit line and allocate certain overhead expenses, the presentation of which is consistent with our peers.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P13_S5	Under the new presentation, we began allocating overhead expenses, depreciation, and amortization of capitalized software.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P13_S6	In addition, in 2016, we changed the rounding of our financial statements from thousands to millions.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P13_S7	Prior periods have been revised to reflect this change in presentation.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P14_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P14_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition, including the expected client life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock-based compensation; (5) fair value of identifiable purchased tangible and intangible assets in a business combination; (6) determination of the reporting unit(s) for goodwill impairment testing; (7) litigation reserves; and (8) capitalized software costs.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P14_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P15_S0	Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker, which we refer to as the CODM, or decision-making group in assessing performance and making decisions regarding resource allocation.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P15_S1	We use consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, and have determined that we operate in one segment.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P15_S2	The CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, uses non-GAAP adjusted operating income (defined as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before (provision for) benefit from income taxes; total other (expense) income; stock-based compensation expense; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development; amortization of purchased intangible assets; integration and transaction costs; and exit costs, including restructuring costs) as the measure of our profit on a regular basis.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P16_S0	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the client, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P16_S1	We derive our revenue from two sources: business services, and implementation and other services.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P16_S2	Business services primarily consists of revenue from our network-enabled billing and practice management service; EHR service; patient engagement and communication service; order transmission and care coordination service; and population health service, as well as clinical decision support through Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P16_S3	Our clients typically purchase one -year service contracts for our integrated, network-enabled services that renew automatically.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P16_S4	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days' notice without cause.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P16_S5	We typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in the same timeframe.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P17_S0	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenaNet, minimum fees, flat fees, or per-claim fees.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	Members enter into subscriptions to the Epocrates point-of-care medical application via an internal or third-party digital distribution platform or through a redeemable subscription code which expires within six to 12 months of issuance.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P19_S1	Basic subscriptions are free and do not expire.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P19_S2	Premium subscription fees are assessed on the length of the subscription period, which is typically one year.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P19_S3	Payment occurs at the time of order, which is in advance of the services being performed, and such amounts are recorded as deferred revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	Premium subscriptions are recognized ratably over the contracted term of delivery, which begins upon activation of the subscription through expiration of the term and is typically one year.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P20_S1	If a subscription code expires before it is redeemed, revenue is recognized upon expiration.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Sponsored clinical information and decision support service clients are charged a fee for the service or group of services to be provided and are typically billed a portion of the contracted fee upon signing of the agreement with the balance billed upon one or more future milestones.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P21_S1	Each service deliverable within these multiple element arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit if the delivered item or items have value to the client on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P21_S2	This is the only criteria we need to assess because our revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return, as we deliver services and not products.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	We consider a deliverable to have stand-alone value if we sell this item separately, if the item is sold by another vendor, or could be resold by the client.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P22_S1	We allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable using our best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of the selling price, or VSOE, or third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE, of fair value.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P22_S2	As a result, any discount or premium inherent in the arrangement is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	Multiple element arrangements require judgments as to how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P23_S1	Due to the specific nature of these agreements, the highly-customized offerings, and the variability in the amount of discount offered for individual services across multiple contracts, we have not been able to conclude that a consistent number of stand-alone sales of a deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range in order to assert that we have established VSOE.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P23_S2	Due to the fact that our services differ significantly from that of our peers and contain a significant level of customization, and the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, we are also currently unable to determine TPE.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P23_S3	We therefore use BESP to establish the relative selling price of our individual deliverables and allocate total consideration to each element in the arrangement.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	We determine BESP for a service by considering multiple factors including an analysis of recent stand-alone sales of that service, market conditions, competitive landscape, and pricing practices.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Implementation and other services revenue primarily consists of the amortization of deferred revenue on implementation services.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	Prior to 2014, all of these fees were billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation was complete, and then, as the service did not have stand-alone value, it was recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected client life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	We evaluate the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on our experience with client contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those clients will receive benefits from our current portfolio of services.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S3	During 2014, we began to sell go-live and training support services separate from the required implementation services.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S4	Go-live and training support services can be purchased by the client from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, have stand-alone value and are recognized upon delivery of service.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S5	When we made this change, we began to include the fees associated with the required implementation services in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, they are being recognized ratably over the client life.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S6	Previously deferred revenue balances related to implementation services that were billed upfront and did not have stand-alone value will continue to be amortized over those remaining client lives.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S7	Certain expenses related to the implementation, go-live and training of a client, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the client.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P25_S8	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	Research and Development Expense Research and development expense consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) for research and development employees and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	All such costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain internal use software costs, which may be capitalized (refer to Note 6 Capitalized Software Costs).
1131096_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	Research and development expense also includes allocated amounts for overhead, depreciation, and amortization.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans; stock options; and restricted stock units with compensation cost measured using the fair value of the awards issued.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value share-based awards and determine the related compensation expense.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	We generally issue previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options; however, we may reissue previously acquired treasury shares to satisfy these awards in the future.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	Certain employees have received awards for which the ultimate number of shares that will be subject to vesting is dependent upon the achievement of certain financial targets for the year.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	Such determination is not made until the award s vesting determination date, which is the date our fiscal year financial statements are available.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	The award is initially recorded at the maximum attainable number of shares that is most likely to be subject to vesting based on available financial forecasts as of the date of grant.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	This amount is adjusted on a quarterly basis as new financial forecasts become available.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P32_S2	Stock based compensation expense for these awards is recorded over the requisite service period, generally four years.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P32_S3	Such awards generally vest ratably over four years from the vesting determination date.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	Advertising Expenses Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	Advertising expense totaled $30.6 million , $28.1 million , and $15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity from the Company s date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	Investments Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase based upon management s intent with regard to such investments.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	Our convertible notes receivable from privately-held companies are accounted for as available-for-sale investments which are carried at cost, which we believe approximates fair value.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	Upon conversion, if any, we assess whether such equity investments should be accounted for on a cost basis or equity method, depending on whether we believe we have significant influence over the investee, the type of equity held and the level of equity interest held in the investee.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P35_S2	Marketable securities, if any, are also accounted for as available-for-sale investments and recorded at fair value.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P35_S3	Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P35_S4	The Company determines realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P35_S5	Management monitors and assesses individual investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	We had no available-for-sale equity securities as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, notes receivable, and accounts receivable.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	We attempt to limit our credit risk associated with cash equivalents and investments by investing and/or depositing in highly-rated corporate and financial institutions, and engaging with highly-rated financial institutions as counterparties to our derivative transactions.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P37_S2	With respect to client accounts receivable, we manage our credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our clients.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P37_S3	No single client accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P37_S4	No single client accounted for a significant portion of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represents unbilled amounts and amounts due from clients for business services.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts, which is determined by establishing reserves for specific accounts and consideration of historical and estimated probable losses.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P38_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the applicable lease terms, excluding renewal periods.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P42_S2	Capitalized Interest Cost Interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically our corporate headquarters campus project and capitalized internal-use software costs, are capitalized until each underlying asset is placed into service.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the effective interest rate of the outstanding debt by the qualifying costs.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	As the qualifying asset is placed into service, the qualifying asset and the related capitalized interest are amortized over the useful life of the related asset.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	Capitalized Software Costs We capitalize certain costs related to the development of athenaNet services and other internal-use software.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	Costs incurred during the application development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable the development will result in new or additional functionality.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P44_S2	The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee wages and stock-based compensation expense, as well as consulting fees for third-party developers working on these projects.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P44_S3	Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	The estimated useful lives of the software is two to five years (refer to Note 6 Capitalized Software Costs).
1131096_17_ITEM15_P45_S2	Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the asset carrying value.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P46_S2	Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P46_S3	No impairment losses have been recognized.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	If the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P49_S2	If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	Purchased Intangible Assets Most of our purchased intangible assets were acquired in connection with business acquisitions, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of economic benefit expected from each asset.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	method, and therefore, the use of the straight-line method was appropriate, as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	Accrued expenses and accrued compensation Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of rent escalation, tenant improvement allowances and other incentives received from landlords related to the operating leases for our facilities.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	Rent escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which we record over the term of the lease.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P54_S2	The excess is recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord or paid on our behalf as part of the negotiated terms of the lease.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	These tenant improvement allowances and other incentives are recorded when realizable as deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense, over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Exit Costs, Including Restructuring Costs Exit costs, including restructuring costs, represent costs related to workforce reductions and to terminate certain lease or other contractual agreements for strategic re-alignment purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the costs related to workforce reductions are primarily included in research and development expenses.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the costs related to termination of leases and contractual agreements and are primarily included in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P57_S2	The activity related to the exit cost accrual during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist of the following:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	Deferred revenue primarily includes amounts associated with multiple element arrangements associated with sponsored clinical information and decision support services which are recognized based upon contractual deliverables and pre-2014 implementation services fees which continue to be recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected client life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P58_S2	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	Preferred Stock Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	liquidation preference, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on our common stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of our common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P60_S2	The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P60_S3	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	Common Stock Common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share and dividends, when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to any preferential rights of preferred stockholders.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	We apply business combination accounting when we acquire a business.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	Business combinations are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P62_S2	The associated acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; non-controlling interests, if any, are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development, if any, is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period affect income tax expense; and goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, are based on management s estimates and assumptions, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P63_S2	If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P63_S3	The results of the acquired businesses operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the combined entity beginning on the date of acquisition.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P63_S4	We have applied this acquisition method to the transactions described in Note 2 Business Combinations.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	Related Party Transaction We have a long-term investment in a vendor.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	The total expense related to this vendor for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $41.1 million , $23.6 million , and $11.3 million , respectively, and the total amount payable related to this vendor at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $4.6 million and $2.3 million , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer periodically charters our company aircraft for personal use.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	The total amount of revenue associated with his plane usage was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	Any change in an enacted tax rate would result in a charge or credit to the income tax provision.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P67_S2	We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P67_S3	Our income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the balance sheet date to be recognized in the related period.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	Sales and Use Taxes Our services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	Our contractual agreements with clients provide that payment of any sales or use tax assessments is the responsibility of the client.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	In certain jurisdictions, sales taxes are collected from the client and remitted to the respective agencies.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	These taxes are recorded on a net basis and excluded from revenue and expense in our financial statements as presented.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Incentives Received from Governmental Bodies From time to time, we receive incentives from various government agencies and programs.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	We account for the portion of the credits that are expected to be used as grants by reducing general and administrative expense.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P71_S2	Credits which are expected to be used to reduce general and administrative expense are recognized when the requirements to earn the credits have been met.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P71_S3	We recognized $3.8 million , $4.1 million , and $1.2 million from our participation in incentive programs during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiary are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P72_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P72_S3	Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded within other comprehensive income (loss).
1131096_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	Employee Benefit Plan We sponsor a 401(k) retirement savings plan, which we refer to as the 401(k) Plan, under which eligible employees may contribute, on a pre-tax basis, specified percentages of their compensation, subject to maximum aggregate annual contributions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P73_S1	All employee contributions are allocated to the employee s individual account and are invested in various investment options as directed by the employee.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P73_S2	Employees cash contributions are fully vested and non-forfeitable.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P73_S3	We may make a discretionary contribution in any year, subject to authorization by our Board of Directors.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P73_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 , our contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $11.3 million , $5.3 million , and $4.5 million , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P74_S2	Under this guidance, a company recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	ASU 2016-09 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods; however, early adoption is permitted.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	We have evaluated ASU 2016-09 and believe that when we adopt this standard for January 1, 2017, our effective tax rate going forward will be impacted.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P75_S2	Also, upon adoption, we will recognize our previously unrecognized excess tax benefits using the modified retrospective transition method, which will result in a cumulative-effect increase of $49.2 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P75_S3	In addition, upon adoption, we no longer intend to calculate an estimate of expected forfeitures and will begin to recognize forfeitures as they occur, which will result in a cumulative-effect increase of $1.0 million to retained earnings with the offset to decrease additional paid-in capital.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	ASU 2016-02 most significantly impacts lessee accounting and disclosures.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	First, this guidance requires lessees to identify arrangements that should be accounted for as leases.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S1	Under ASU 2016-02, for lease arrangements exceeding a 12-month term, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation is recorded by the lessee for all leases, whether operating or financing, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases and amortization/interest expense for financing leases.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S2	The balance sheet amount recorded for existing leases at the date of adoption of ASU 2016-02 must be calculated using the applicable incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S3	Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S4	In addition, ASU 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S5	This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S6	We anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as all long-term leases will be capitalized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P77_S7	We intend to early adopt this standard effective January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	ASU 2014-09, which was issued in March 2014 and has been codified with the Accounting Standards Codification as Topic 606, is now effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	In addition, ASC 606 provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including, but not limited to, when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	ASC 606 provides companies with two implementation methods.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P80_S1	Companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application).
1131096_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	Since ASU 2014-09 was issued, several additional ASUs have been issued and incorporated within ASC 606 to clarify various elements of the guidance.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	We anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements with respect to the capitalization of costs of commissions, upfront costs, and other contract acquisition-based and contract fulfillment costs on our consolidated balance sheets.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	We are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, including the impact to the pattern with which we recognize revenue.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Patient IO On August 25, 2016, we acquired Filament Labs, Inc. (doing business as Patient IO), an Austin-based care coordination platform used by providers to engage patients and caregivers outside the four walls of the clinic.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S1	Prior to this acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MDP Accelerator, LLC, held shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Patient IO.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S2	We acquired Patient IO to strengthen our ability to partner with providers as they deliver value-based care.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S3	We anticipate this acquisition will accelerate our movement toward becoming a trusted resource and partner to the patient.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S4	The purchase price of Patient IO was $15.2 million , net of cash acquired.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S5	The purchase price excludes $9.6 million to be earned by key employees of Patient IO based upon continued employment, which is accounted for as compensation expense and will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the requisite service period.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S6	The fair value of net assets acquired included purchased intangible assets of $5.3 million related to technology acquired and $0.6 million related to customer relationships.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S7	The $10.7 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S8	As part of this acquisition, we remeasured our existing 10.1% preferred stock investment at fair value which resulted in a $0.8 million gain recognized in earnings as a benefit to general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S9	The gain was calculated by utilizing the purchase price of the acquisition.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S10	We believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but certain items, such as the working capital adjustments to the purchase price, are subject to change as additional information is received about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S11	Thus, the provisional measurements of fair value set forth above are subject to change.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S12	We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S13	On April 11, 2016, we acquired Arsenal Health, formerly known as Smart Scheduling, Inc., for $1.7 million .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S14	We purchased Arsenal Health in order to add its schedule optimization functionality to our athenaCoordinator offering.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S15	We expect this acquisition to accelerate our capabilities in machine learning and predictive analytics.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S16	The fair value of the purchased intangible assets related to technology acquired was $0.9 million .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S17	The $0.8 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the purchased intangible assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P83_S18	In conjunction with this acquisition, Smart Scheduling, Inc. settled the convertible note receivable and related interest from our More Disruption Please, or MDP, Accelerator Program, which represented a total fair value of $0.3 million .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	RazorInsights On January 13, 2015, we acquired Razor Insights, LLC, or RazorInsights, for $39.9 million in cash after net working capital adjustments.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P84_S1	We acquired RazorInsights for the assembled workforce, technology, customer base, and to accelerate our entry into the inpatient market.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	The fair value of net assets acquired, after measurement period adjustments totaling $1.0 million , was $8.9 million , including purchased intangible assets of $7.0 million related to technology acquired and $4.0 million related to customer relationships.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P85_S1	The $31.1 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P86_S2	Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, and shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P86_S3	Under the treasury stock method, dilutive securities are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the periods and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P86_S4	Securities are excluded from the computations of diluted net income (loss) per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share; therefore, in periods of net loss, shares used to calculate basic and dilutive net loss per share are equivalent.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P86_S5	The following table reconciles the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 0.4 million and 0.7 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their estimated fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	Money market funds are valued using a market approach based upon the quoted market prices of identical instruments when available or other observable inputs such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets or similar securities.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	Derivatives are carried at fair value, as determined using standard valuation models, and adjusted when necessary for credit risk.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P89_S2	Refer to Note 9 Debt for additional information.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	Our MDP Accelerator program is designed to cultivate heath care information technology start-ups and expand services offered to our provider network.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	MDP Accelerator portfolio investments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are typically made in the form of convertible notes receivable or cost method investments, which are included in investments and other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P90_S2	At September 30, 2016, we evaluated performance risk and fully impaired one of the convertible notes receivable.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P90_S3	As there is no indication of performance risk related to the remaining notes receivable as of December 31, 2016 , we estimate that the fair value of the notes receivable approximates cost, based on inputs including the original transaction prices, our own recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investments, subsequent rounds of financing, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows (Level 3).
1131096_17_ITEM15_P90_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , we had $292.5 million outstanding on our term loan facility and we had not drawn on our revolving credit facility under the 2015 Credit Agreement (see Note 9 Debt).
1131096_17_ITEM15_P90_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , we had $300.0 million outstanding on our term loan facility and nothing outstanding on our revolving credit facility.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	The credit facility carries a variable interest rate set at current market rates, and as such, the carrying value approximates fair values.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we utilized an interest rate swap to manage exposure to interest rates on the variable rate of our indebtedness.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P91_S2	We designated our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge, and changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were recognized, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged items are recognized in earnings.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P91_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , no amount was recognized in earnings related to our interest rate swap.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P91_S4	There was no ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate swap, nor was any amount excluded from ineffectiveness testing, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1131096_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	The interest rate swap expired in August 2016.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P92_S2	We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P92_S3	The estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreement with a certain financial institution at December 31, 2015 was a liability of $0.2 million based on inputs other than quoted prices that were observable for the interest rate swap.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P92_S4	Inputs included present value of fixed and projected floating rate cash flows over term of the swap contract.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	The following table presents information about our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques we utilized to determine such fair value.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities obtained from readily available pricing sources for similar instruments.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P93_S2	The fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable values which are supported by little or no market activity.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P93_S3	It is our policy to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period; however, there have been no such transfers during any of the periods presented.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	(a) Recorded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	The following table presents our financial instruments measured at fair value using unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1131096_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consists of the following:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $47.9 million , $40.1 million , and $31.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS Capitalized software consisted of the following:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	Capitalized software amortization expense totaled $73.5 million , $53.4 million , and $33.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P99_S1	Future amortization expense for all capitalized software placed in service as of December 31, 2016 is estimated to be:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	The following table summarizes the activity related to the carrying value of our goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 :

1131096_17_ITEM15_P102_S1	Estimated amortization expense on purchased intangible assets, based upon our intangible assets at December 31, 2016 , is as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	OPERATING LEASES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS We maintain operating leases for facilities and certain office equipment.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P103_S1	The facility leases contain renewal options and require payments of certain utilities, taxes, and shared operating costs of each leased facility.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P103_S2	The rental agreements expire at various dates from 2017 to 2030.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P103_S3	Rent expense totaled $13.7 million , $9.8 million , and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P103_S4	Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:
1131096_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	On May 5, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which we refer to as the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P104_S1	The 2015 Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement, dated as of May 10, 2013, which we refer to as the 2013 Credit Agreement, and provides for a $500.0 million senior credit facility, or 2015 Senior Credit Facility, consisting of a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P104_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $292.5 million and $300.0 million was outstanding on the unsecured term loan facility, respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P104_S3	A portion of the proceeds received from the 2015 Senior Credit Facility were used to repay the outstanding revolving loans under the 2013 Credit Agreement such that there were no revolving loans outstanding on the closing of the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	The 2015 Credit Agreement contains terms and conditions that are customary to credit facilities of this nature.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Senior Credit Facility may be used for refinancing existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P106_S1	We may increase the revolving credit facility up to an additional $100.0 million and may increase the term loan facility to the extent that such amount will not cause us to be in breach of our financial covenants, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining lender commitments.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P106_S2	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility matures on May 5, 2020, although we may prepay the 2015 Senior Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, and the unutilized portion of the commitments may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by us in whole or in part without penalty or premium.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	At our option, any loans under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility (other than swing line loans) will bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% , and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00% ) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P107_S1	The interest rate for the 2015 Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 1.61% and 1.74% , respectively.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P107_S2	We will pay a commitment fee during the term of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility, which varies between 0.20% and 0.40% based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P107_S3	We incurred financing fees of $1.0 million for the 2015 Senior Credit Facility, which are being amortized as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the five -year term of the agreement.

1131096_17_ITEM15_P347_S0	The following items and areas of work have been shown on the Contract Documents but have not been included within the GMP Pricing.
1131096_17_ITEM15_P347_S1	It is understood that the cost of work for each item below will be funded from Projects other than the West Garage.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	athenahealth, Inc. (which we refer to as athenahealth, the Company, we, or our) partners with hospital and ambulatory clients to drive clinical and financial results.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	We offer network-based medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services, as well as Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our network provides clients better insight into their own organizations as well as the ability to learn from the experience of every other client on the network.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P0_S3	Through our model, we infuse the knowledge clients need to thrive in a changing industry directly into their workflow, from clinical guidelines to payer rules.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P0_S4	We take on back-office work at scale so providers can focus on patients, not paperwork.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our purpose is to unleash our collective potential to transform healthcare.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design our services to help minimize the hassles that healthcare providers and their staff face from complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many related tasks that can take attention away from delivering care.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	We believe our services empower healthcare providers to achieve and sustain financial health while staying focused on quality patient care.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	We deliver the majority of our service offerings through a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	By combining our commitment to opening up the network, multiplying our intelligence, and freeing people to do what matters, we help healthcare providers leverage technology to automate certain back-office tasks, assist at the point of care, and adapt to changes in government regulatory schemes or the billing requirements of payers.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	In most cases, we charge clients a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients, connecting our financial results directly to those of our clients and our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P2_S3	In 2017 , we generated revenue of $1,220.3 million compared to $1,082.9 million in 2016 and $924.7 million in 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	We incorporated in Delaware in 1997.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The healthcare industry is complex, disconnected, and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that may not be able to support the current needs for usability, flexibility, and interoperability.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Medical groups and health systems face rising costs and complexity from a variety of factors, including legislative and regulatory reform efforts, changes in health benefit plan design, complicated reimbursement models, partners demand for electronic data exchange, and continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	In addition, medical groups and health systems face time-consuming administrative challenges, such as consolidating and reporting to government quality performance programs, processing and sorting a practice s incoming paper documents, identifying and managing payer rules, collecting payments from uninsured, underinsured, and high deductible health plan patients, having a live operator take patient phone calls after a practice closes for the day, and communicating physician orders and referrals to others.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	We believe the traditional software model fails to address many of the challenges experienced by medical groups and health systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	The majority of the health information technology market operates on locally-installed, conventional software.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	We believe this delivery model does not allow for rapid innovation, timely upgrades, or intelligent evolution of system functionality to address client needs.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	Additionally, locally-installed software requires a sizable upfront investment in hardware and software plus the staff to manage and maintain these systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	With the traditional software model, the client is still responsible for all of the back-office work from managing claims to handling time-consuming clinical paperwork.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	In contrast, we believe a cloud-based network is better positioned to solve a greater set of problems because it can quickly be updated and delivered to all clients as a single, shared instance of a network-enabled platform without expensive installations or upgrades.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our network-enabled platform also allows clients to receive the benefits and learnings of every other client on the network.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Integrating our back-office services, as well as many other services, with our cloud-based network is the crux of our services model.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our cloud-based network is designed to deliver the right knowledge to the right person at the right time, while our back-office services execute work, at scale, that would otherwise fall upon the client.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	By allowing athenahealth to address these problems, healthcare providers can focus on delivering the highest quality of care and free their staff to spend time on higher-value tasks.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	We are committed to building the most connected network in healthcare and to driving meaningful, measurable results for everyone on our network.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	The connectivity and system infrastructure we provide would normally be unattainable for small independent practices or hospitals, which make up a large portion of the healthcare market.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	However, because we automate processes and scale work across our entire network, we can efficiently deliver our services to medical practices of every size as well as small health systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P9_S3	By giving small practices much of the same technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefits not only to those practices, but also to their clinical exchange and trading partners with whom they share vital information.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P9_S4	As practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility enhances our ability to compete, regardless of whether a practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P9_S5	In addition, we price our services as a percentage of collections in most cases, a strategy that incentivizes us to improve performance and reduce costs through more efficient operations.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P9_S6	Key elements of our strategic priorities include:
1131096_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	We live in relentless pursuit of open healthcare and believe all will benefit from fluid exchange of information and unfettered access to innovation.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	We aim to create a dynamic, multi-sided market linking patients, providers, and entrepreneurs to a single clinical and financial record that integrates information for the user from any system on which information resides.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	The notion of an open ecosystem and marketplace is deeply rooted in our product DNA and the power of our network, which includes approximately 111,000 providers and 106 million patients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	including integration with our More Disruption Please, or MDP, partners solutions, to provide solutions for new modalities across care settings.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe the best results come from the insight of all.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	We will bring together knowledge from every interaction, expand it exponentially, and concentrate it where and when it is needed.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	In a networked world, this picture changes rapidly as the traditional consumer becomes an active producer of information, adding knowledge and value to the system in a positive feedback loop.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	For years, we have leveraged our network insight to benchmark client performance and get our clients paid more, sooner.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	Now, we can add knowledge faster than ever before to continually improve provider and staff processes and insights to inform or prompt action.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P12_S5	We look to realize the true promise of multiplied intelligence in the virtuous feedback loop that emerges as we learn from the network, then design our products based on that learning to drive improved outcomes.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Free people to do what matters.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	We strive to remove friction and frustration from the healthcare experience by freeing up providers, staff, healthcare leaders, and patients to focus their time and energies on the work that matters most, liberating us all to achieve our highest purpose.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	We have had a long-standing commitment to removing any provider work that we can do more efficiently at scale from claims processing to quality program reporting to authorization management.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	As our platform evolves, we will continue to shift from cumbersome manual processing to automation of client tasks that churn out insights at exponentially greater speed and scale.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We deliver the majority of our service offerings through a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	By combining our commitment to opening up the network, multiplying our intelligence, and freeing people to do what matters, we help medical groups and health systems leverage technology to automate certain back-office tasks, assist at the point of care, and adapt to changes in government regulatory schemes or the billing requirements of payers.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe that including our clients on the same instance of software creates a network effect that enables each client to benefit from the collective experience of other clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	As our network grows, we believe these benefits expand and we can further multiply intelligence for all clients on the network.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	athenaNet acts as a conduit for the exchange of information among clients, payers, trading partners, and our own experienced team.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	It enables us to learn continuously, innovate with agility, and deliver near-instant updates that we believe rapidly improve performance for our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	In addition, our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	This work ranges from receiving, scanning, and delivering faxes to tracking claims with payers and managing denials.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S4	We automate this work whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work at massive scale with our internal team and in partnership with Access Healthcare Services USA, LLC and our other third-party providers.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S5	The knowledge we gain from doing work for our clients and discovering ways to improve their performance is culled, curated, and captured within athenaNet through mechanisms that include our proprietary billing rules engine and clinical quality management engine.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S6	Using this knowledge, we also proactively coach our clients on best practices to help improve their performance.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S7	As we work with clients, payers, and other industry trading partners, more knowledge and intelligence is infused into each service, which we believe makes athenaNet smarter and more powerful for our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P16_S8	This unique combination of opening up the network, multiplying our intelligence, and freeing people to do what matters is fundamental to our service model and value proposition to clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	We have developed a number of network-enabled services to support healthcare providers across the continuum of care.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	We offer various combinations of our services to our clients, including athenaOne and athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems, depending on whether they are medical groups and practices or hospitals and larger health systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , our suite of network-enabled services are shown in the following table and also described below:
1131096_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	athenaCollector is our network-enabled billing and practice management solution that eliminates or reduces many time-consuming activities that typically burden our clients and their staff, allowing them to focus more on patient care and other business priorities.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	athenaCollector includes our intuitive, web-based practice management solution that helps clients improve practice management by simplifying workflows related to patient registration, scheduling, check-in, charge entry, referral management, checkout, follow-up, collections, accounting, and reporting.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	In addition, athenaCollector includes our proprietary billing rules engine, which represents the industry s largest database of payer-specific reimbursement requirements.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	It delivers in-depth insight and knowledge to our clients that helps them get paid by health insurers.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	With athenaCollector, we also perform back-office services in partnership with our clients at all key steps of the billing process, including: generating and submitting electronic and paper claims, confirming receipt of claims and resubmitting lost claims, posting remittance advice received from payers, following up on unpaid and denied claims, updating our rules engine to help prevent denial recurrences, and reviewing key performance metrics.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	athenaClinicals, our network-enabled electronic health record, or EHR, service, organizes the moment of care to help providers maximize their clinical productivity and maintain focus on their patients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	athenaClinicals combines a web-based EHR with a clinical cycle management solution and a back-office document management service to help manage patients clinical documentation.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	The web-based EHR application included in athenaClinicals addresses the core clinical workflows of a practice including: clinical chart, encounter documentation, order entry, results viewing, patient call tracking, clinical reminder tracking, and workflow task management.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	athenaClinicals includes a global library of content that is available for all clients and provides a starting point for certain specialty-specific content.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P19_S4	athenaClinicals also acts as a virtual clinical back office for our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P19_S5	Our document services team takes on burdensome administrative work on behalf of our clients by processing incoming documents and routing them to the practice s staff for review via document routing rules defined by the client.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	athenaCommunicator is our network-enabled patient engagement and communication solution that provides an on-demand, automated, communication service between patients and provider practices for interactions outside the exam room.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	athenaCommunicator uses phone, e-mail, a patient portal, and our own team of operators to help improve financial and operational performance for our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	athenaCommunicator enables clients to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our automated messaging platform delivers phone calls, text messages, and e-mails to patients, including appointment reminders, past due balance alerts, disease management initiatives, secure test results, and other compliance-driven campaigns.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our patient portal enables patients to express communication preferences, view lab results, review appointment information, exchange secure messages with providers, update personal information, and pay bills.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	Additionally, we print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of our clients to assist with patient payment collection.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P21_S4	Collectively, these activities expand the availability of the medical practice to patients and help alleviate the burden of administrative communications, freeing staff to focus on higher-value and more critical tasks.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P21_S5	In addition, by tracking patients responses, we are able to optimize the effectiveness of these communications.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	athenaCoordinator is our network-enabled order transmission and care coordination service.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	athenaCoordinator is focused on increasing efficiency for healthcare providers utilizing multiple information technology systems and helps to provide efficient care for patients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	athenaCoordinator is founded on three core value drivers: more convenient access to patient data for referring providers, greater visibility into a patient s full care picture and ordering choices, and less work in managing the movement of patients and their data through the referral chain.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	This value is delivered through six core network service elements: order management and referral management, scheduling, registration, messaging, charts, and third-party integration.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P22_S4	athenaCoordinator is not offered as a stand-alone solution but instead must be utilized with athenaCollector, athenaClinicals, and athenaCommunicator.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	athenahealth Population Health is our population health solution that combines services with software and analytics.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	This comprehensive, cloud-based population health service identifies patients in need of care and analyzes the clinical and financial results of that care to drive improvements in outcomes and costs.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	After clients transfer data from payers, finance systems, laboratories, clinical repositories, and/or EHRs, athenahealth Population Health processes and integrates that data and provides a platform through which clients can gain insight into and manage the health of their patient population.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	The population health management functionality of athenahealth Population Health consists of data integration for payer feeds and EHRs, a virtual desktop, and a web portal to gain insight into and take action on that data.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	In addition to providing native decision support functionality into our suite of service offerings, athenahealth also offers other stand-alone applications to providers at the point of care.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	These services, provided through our Epocrates brand, center around a variety of clinical information and decision support offerings available through healthcare providers mobile devices.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	Epocrates services include: drug and disease information, medical calculator and tools, clinical guidelines, and clinical messaging.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P25_S3	The majority of healthcare professionals using our clinical information services access the free versions of our applications; premium subscriptions for some of these services are also available, and some services are sponsored by clients in the healthcare industry (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, managed care companies, and market research firms) that seek opportunities to engage with our network of members.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P25_S4	The Epocrates network of members consists of over one million healthcare professionals, including approximately 50% of U.S. physicians.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P25_S5	We believe the features available through our Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications allow healthcare professionals to leverage technology and clinical content to help inform prescribing decisions, improve workflow, and enhance patient safety.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	In addition to the services described above, we also offer the following services to certain clients:
1131096_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	athenahealth Health Plan Data Exchange facilitates efficiencies in the exchange of data between providers and health plans for the healthcare operations of clients that also utilize athenaClinicals and athenaCollector.

1131096_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Authorization Management includes both pre-certification processing and referral processing services.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	We review orders and referrals to determine whether a pre-certification or referral from a primary care physician, or PCP, is required under a patient s health plan and then compile the necessary clinical documentation to attain such pre-certifications or PCP referral.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our research and development efforts focus on enhancing and expanding our service offerings in response to changes in the market and to better serve medical groups and health systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	All of our clients that utilize athenaNet services use the same version of athenaNet, with some rules designed to take effect locally for particular clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	We continually update our software and rules, and execute periodic releases of new software functionality for our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our software development life cycle methodology is designed to ensure that each software release is properly designed, built, tested, and released.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	Our research and development teams are located in the United States and India.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	In addition to our core software development activities, we dedicate full-time staff to the ongoing development and maintenance of our rules database for the athenaCollector services.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	We also employ program management and product management and user experience personnel, who work continually on improvements to our research and development processes and our service design, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	In 2017 , we incurred $173.6 million in research and development expenses, compared to $134.5 million in 2016 and $111.0 million in 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of clients, including healthcare providers, medical groups, and health systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	We expect to expand our network by selling our complete suite of services to new clients and cross-selling additional services into our existing client base.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	In 2017, we organized our sales force into two segments for sales of athenahealth-branded services to better address our clients needs and our markets: the enterprise team, which is dedicated to serving community hospitals, regional and national health systems, payers, and integrated healthcare enterprises; and the independent medical group team, which is dedicated to independent medical practices of all sizes.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	We also have a pharmaceutical sales teams dedicated to sales of our Epocrates-branded services for pharmaceutical and other institutional clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P34_S3	Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients we conduct a consultative sales process for most of our offerings, which generally includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	We refer to these third parties as channels and the individuals and organizations involved as our channel partners.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for their services.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	These channel partners typically do not make direct sales.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P35_S4	Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as independent marketing representatives, purchasing agents (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or in other joint marketing capacities.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P35_S5	In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so they accept our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	In addition, we use the Epocrates member network as a lead-generation platform for selling our athenahealth-branded services.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our marketing and awareness initiatives are generally targeted toward specific segments of the healthcare market.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Competition We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition in the marketplace, particularly given increased EHR adoption rates and consolidation within the industry.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our primary competitors use locally-installed software to manage the various clinical and financial workflow needs within the medical group or health system.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	Other nationwide competitors offer services they refer to as on-demand or software-as-a-service models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	Companies that sell practice management, EHR, care coordination software and services, population health management services, and/or clinical health management tools include: AdvancedMD, Inc.; Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; CareCloud Corporation; Cerner Corporation; eClinicalWorks, LLC; Epic Systems Corporation; Greenway Health, LLC; McKesson Corp.; Optum, Inc.; Practice Fusion, Inc.; Quality Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC; SCI Solutions, Inc.; Medscape; UpToDate, Inc.; Computer Programs and Systems, Inc., and Medical Information Technology, Inc.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
1131096_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	However, some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	As a result, these companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, and patent prosecution and litigation.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the healthcare industry in which we operate is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	As a result, the services we provide are subject to a complex array of healthcare laws and regulations, including, among others, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it, which we refer to as HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which we refer to as the HITECH Act, regulations issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and a number of fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our subsidiaries in India are subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	These and other regulations to which we are subject are more fully described in Risk Factors RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S4	We have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S5	As of December 31, 2017 , we held 16 U.S. patents and 4 foreign patents, with a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S6	Our issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2020 and 2034.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S7	We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to protect our brand.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P41_S8	We will continue to file and prosecute applications for patents and trademarks when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies and our brand.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	We have a policy of requiring employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level and service mix of healthcare providers.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	Typically, discretionary use of healthcare provider services declines during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our healthcare provider clients in mid-January.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our seasonality is further explained in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Employees As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately 5,156 full-time employees, with approximately 2,711 in service operations, 615 in selling and marketing, 1,402 in research and development, and 428 in general and administrative functions.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	Of these full-time employees, approximately 4,263 were located in the U.S. and 893 were located in India.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
1131096_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.

1131096_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS GENERAL We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The provision by third parties of medical billing and practice management services to medical practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty, a limited set of payers, or a limited geographical area.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We anticipate that the software, statistical, and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Electronic health records, or EHR, and practice management software for medical groups and health systems has historically been dominated by large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these entities are now offering hosted services or software-as-a-service models under which software is centrally administered, and these vendors may also provide administrative and billing services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	breadth of offerings of the larger entities are increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We expect large integrated technology companies to continue to become more active in our markets, both through acquisition and internal investment.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, a few smaller companies have started providing single-instance, internet-based software using a model similar to ours; the offerings of these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage of our services and impact our market share.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Further, while the market for patient engagement, population health, and care coordination services is growing and is not as yet dominated by a small group of vendors with significant resources, our patient engagement, population health, and care coordination services face competition from a wide variety of market participants.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	For example, certain health systems have developed their own patient portals, population health, and care coordination systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If we fail to distinguish our patient engagement, population health, and care coordination offerings from the other options available to healthcare providers, the demand for and market share of those offerings may decrease.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S7	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, we compete with other companies for users of the types of drug and clinical reference tools that we offer and for budget dollars from our pharmaceutical, managed care, and market research clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We compete within a broad industry of healthcare content providers for the attention of healthcare professionals who can choose to use mobile, online, or print media to reference clinical information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S9	Companies providing clinical content include Medscape, a division of WebMD, LLC, and UpToDate, Inc., a division of Wolters Kluwer Health.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P4_S10	Competition from each of these sources of clinical reference content may lead to a loss of our existing network members and a reduction in the rate at which we attract new members for our clinical information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our primary competition for the promotional spend available from our pharmaceutical clients in the area of interactive services is from companies, including WebMD, that help such companies market their products, programs, and services to healthcare professionals.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our market research business competes with numerous companies that recruit physicians to participate in surveys in a variety of formats, as well as the recruitment arms of market research companies that have assembled their own survey panels of healthcare professionals.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	To the extent competing channels are available to access healthcare professionals, including physicians, the value of our interactive services to our clients is reduced.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Some of our current large competitors, such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Cerner Corporation; Epic Systems Corporation; McKesson Corp.; and Quality Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and/or significantly greater resources than we do.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We expect to face new competitors as we continue to develop and offer services for the inpatient market.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products, directly competing with our integrated offerings.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, greater breadth and volume of data, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, broader offerings, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Further, in light of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential clients might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S11	We face competition from new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, and from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions, which have information systems in place with clients in our target markets.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P5_S12	These existing enterprise vendors may now, or in the future, offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services, but offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The market for cloud-based services for healthcare information technology may not develop substantially further or may develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The market for cloud-based services for healthcare information technology remains narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of cloud-based services in general, and for their revenue, clinical, and patient cycles in particular.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to a cloud-based service.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Changes in the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our services, cause our existing contracts to terminate, and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As the healthcare industry evolves, changes in our member, client, and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services, result in the termination of existing contracts or certain services provided under existing contracts, and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	For example, the current trend toward consolidation of healthcare providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Such larger healthcare organizations may also have their own practice management services and health IT systems, reducing demand for our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Similarly, client and vendor consolidation results in fewer, larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If these trends continue, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base, negotiate contracts with acceptable terms, or maintain our current pricing structure, and our revenues may decrease.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	General reductions in expenditures by healthcare companies, or reductions in such expenditures within market segments that we serve, could have similar impacts with regard to our interactive services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Such reductions may result from, among other things, reduced governmental funding for healthcare; a decrease in the number of, or the market exclusivity available to, new drugs coming to market; government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients, pharmaceutical companies, payers, or other healthcare industry participants ( e.g. , limitations on advertising to physicians or required disclosure of payments made to them); or adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers, the pharmaceutical industry, or other healthcare companies that purchase our interactive services ( e.g. , changes in the design of health plans).
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Any of these changes could reduce the purchase of our services by such interactive services clients, reducing our revenue and possibly requiring us to materially revise our offerings.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P7_S9	In addition, our interactive services clients expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to services of the types we provide.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We recently implemented a comprehensive plan, which we refer to as the Plan, designed to increase our strategic focus and improve operational efficiency; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in fully implementing the Plan, or that it will have the effects we intend.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Plan itself, or our failure to successfully implement the Plan, could have a material negative impact on our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In August 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors and management team had commenced a comprehensive review of our operations, cost structure, and capital allocation.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The review included all parts of our business, including sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, service operations, product portfolio, and organizational structure.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In October 2017, the Board approved and we announced the Plan, designed to increase our strategic focus and improve operational efficiency.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In connection with the Plan, we took steps to reduce our workforce by approximately 9% and the Plan is expected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges related to these workforce reductions.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We anticipate completing the majority of activities under the Plan in 2018.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in fully implementing the Plan in a timely manner or at all, or that the Plan will have the effects that we intend.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	If we fail to successfully implement the Plan, or implementation is materially delayed, it could materially adversely affect our financial results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S7	In addition, the Plan itself, in particular the workforce reductions and other cost-cutting measures we have implemented and intend to continue to implement, could themselves have a material negative impact on our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P9_S8	If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to clients and users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The market for healthcare in the U.S. is in the early stages of structural change and is rapidly evolving toward a more value-based care model.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client and user requirements, and sustain market acceptance.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our future financial performance will depend in part on growth in this market and on our ability to adapt to emerging demands of this market, including adapting to the ways our clients or users access and use our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients or users.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients and users will want, while offering these services at competitive prices.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may lose clients and users.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients and users, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P10_S8	This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Failure to manage our growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the past, we have experienced periods of high and moderate growth.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We believe that increasing awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread adoption of our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Promotional activities may not generate an increase in awareness or revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building awareness.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Besides awareness, we must continue to maintain, and may need to enhance, our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We also must attract, train, and/or retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, service offering personnel, and management personnel.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Failure to manage our growth effectively could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in technology and operations; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, or loss of productivity or business opportunities; reduce client or user satisfaction; limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources and management attention from other projects, such as the development of new or enhanced services or the acquisition of suitable businesses or technologies.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	If we are unable to retain existing members of our Epocrates network and attract new members, especially physician members with desired characteristics for our interactive services who actively participate in those services, our revenue will decline and some of our business will suffer.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Members of our Epocrates network who subscribe to our premium drug and clinical reference products usually do so for a term of one year and may elect to cancel the subscription for any renewal terms.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Under certain circumstances, our members may cancel their subscriptions prior to expiration.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Factors that may affect the retention rate of our existing members and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools include:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Unless we are able to provide current, relevant, and reliable healthcare content, drug and clinical reference tools, formulary hosting, and other services that meet and continue to meet the needs of healthcare professionals, including physicians, the value of those services to new and existing members will decrease.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our provision of such services depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified physician and pharmacist editors and authors, license accurate and relevant content from third parties, contract with health plans and insurers to host formulary information, monitor and respond to changes in member interest in specific topics, and develop new or enhanced services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If we cannot meet our staffing needs or develop or acquire needed content at a reasonable cost, if there are errors or omissions in such content, if our competitors obtain exclusive access to or develop content that healthcare professionals consider superior to ours, or if we cannot meet the needs of our members, the value of our content and services would diminish.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The reputation of our Epocrates brand is dependent in large part on the medical community s continued perception of us as independent from our healthcare industry clients, particularly pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If healthcare professionals believe that we are too closely associated with such clients as a result of the revenue we receive from their purchase or sponsorship of our interactive services, the credibility of our brand will diminish.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We cannot assure you that the medical community will view our content as sufficiently unbiased.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If the reputation of our brand is damaged, it will be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to restore the quality of our brand with healthcare professionals and our business could suffer.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If the developers of mobile operating systems and mobile devices with which our products and services are compatible fail to remain competitive in the marketplace and to be adopted into medical practice and practice workflow, members will be less inclined to use our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing products and services, including mobile, web-based, and traditional products and services offered by competitors or through online resources and searches may affect our retention rate and the rate at which we attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The availability of download sites such as the Apple App Store SM that offer numerous free or low-priced competing products at one location has also reduced the demand for our paid subscription products.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We expect the use of such sites to expand, reducing the number of paying members for our drug and clinical reference tools as a percentage of total members.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition to the loss of subscription revenue, our inability to attract or retain members, especially physician members with desired characteristics, such as specialty and prescribing habits, who update their mobile devices through our servers with sufficient frequency, may cause an even more significant decline in revenue from our interactive services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	messages, formularies, and other sponsored content, and, without sufficient active members who meet desired criteria, those clients may reduce their subscription for our interactive services, and our revenue may decline.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Even if the number of our members is not materially reduced, their participation in our services may decrease, which could impact our revenues.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have established limits on the number and the mix of sponsored and non-sponsored messages delivered to members in order to promote the quality of members experience with our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If an insufficient number of members update during a given service period, or the demand for promotional clinical messaging sponsorship exceeds the available supply, our healthcare clients could become dissatisfied with our service.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	As a result, we may be unable to grow our interactive services revenue beyond the bounds we have set, as changes to such limits could cause our members to be dissatisfied with our services and the response to our interactive services to decrease.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Furthermore, if our members generally become less responsive to participating in our services, the value of these interactive services will likely decline.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	This could cause our revenue to remain flat or to decline.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Finally, if there is a reduction in the number of network members or their participation in our services, certain anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Epocrates, such as increased name recognition and reputation, cross-sell potential, and the market acceptance of joint services may not be fully realized, if at all.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S10	We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as access and use restrictions and other contractual provisions, to protect these rights.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S11	Our attempts to protect our intellectual property through copyright, patent, and trademark registration may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S12	We have 16 issued U.S. patents, 4 issued foreign patents, and a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending as of December 31, 2017 .
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S13	The scope of our issued patents may be insufficient to prevent competitors from providing products and services similar to ours, our patents may be successfully challenged, and we may not be able to obtain additional meaningful patent protection in the future.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S14	Our agreements with clients and users and with certain vendors and strategic partners limit their use of, and retain our rights in, our intellectual property and proprietary information and grant us ownership of or rights to license intellectual property created in the performance of those agreements to the extent that it relates to the provision of our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S15	In addition, we require certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain of our vendors and strategic partners to agree to contract provisions regarding confidentiality and non-competition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S16	However, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S17	Further, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in preventing the unauthorized access to, or use of, our proprietary information or the reverse engineering of our technology.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P16_S18	In any event, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technology or authoring clinical information that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or the information we distribute.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	After the expiration or due to the absence of certain restrictions in our agreements with vendors, including non-competition restrictions, vendors may partner with our competitors, which may adversely impact our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, our platforms incorporate open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	For example, some open source licenses require that those using the associated code disclose modifications made to that code and that such modifications be licensed to third parties at no cost, among other restrictions or obligations that could be detrimental to our business, operating results or financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Some open source software licenses automatically terminate upon any violation of their terms.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Accordingly, any failure to comply with the licenses applicable to open source software may require us to re-engineer portions of our technologies, discontinue use of such open source software, which could impact our ability to sell certain offerings that use that open source software, or result in infringement of third-party intellectual property, which could result in litigation and liability for us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	There can be no assurance that efforts we take to monitor the use of open source software to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code, or avoid other detrimental restrictions or obligations imposed by certain open source licenses, will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Moreover, our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties, some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims of rights against their use, and we could lose the right to use technologies that are the subject of such claims.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and some require us to indemnify our clients, partners, and third-party service providers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Indemnification obligations of our partners and third-party service providers may not be effective or adequate to protect us or the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S8	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology or information to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services; or that we would not need to change our product and design plans, which could require us to redesign affected products or services or delay new offerings.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Current and future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could result in additional liabilities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S11	We may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties, including government agencies, patients or vendors of our clients, or stockholders.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S13	For example, in May 2013 we purchased the property on which our corporate headquarters are located.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S14	This property is a former Superfund site, and our ownership of it, or any of our other properties, could expose us to liability under applicable environmental laws, as well as to liability as a landlord or as owner of property that may be used by members of the public.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S15	Any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs, operationally restrict our business, and may divert management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S16	Insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P22_S17	A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS We depend upon third-party service providers for important functions of our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We depend upon third-party providers, and in some cases, limited or single-source providers, for important functions of our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	For example, we rely on Access Healthcare Services USA, LLC to provide the majority of our data entry and certain other services, from facilities located in India and the Philippines, to support our client service operations, including, among other things, processing critical claims data and clinical documents, credentialing, and enrollment services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, we rely on our banking partner, U.S. Bank, for depositing client funds that we collect into our clients bank accounts.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Failure of these service providers to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation, and could disrupt our business operations, and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	international locations where certain of our third-party service providers have facilities and operations also increases our risk.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	With respect to certain of our service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access or through third-party platforms to which our clients provide us with access.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Although we have back-up functionality for some of these services, if we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources, and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients, with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain clients, and reduction of our revenue or operating margin.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	We depend on client satisfaction to succeed, both with respect to our cloud-based software and client support services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Our sales organization is dependent on the quality of our service offerings, our business reputation, and strong recommendations from existing clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	If our cloud-based software does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert claims against us or terminate their contracts with us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or retain clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	We provide client support services to resolve any issues related to our service offerings.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Our client support team may be unable to respond quickly or efficiently enough to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support, particularly as we increase the size of our client base.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S11	It is difficult to predict client demand for support services and if client demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S12	Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly-responsive client support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly-responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective clients, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S13	Various risks could affect our worldwide operations, exposing us to significant costs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S14	We conduct operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through our service providers.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S15	Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, protectionism, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, unfavorable intellectual property protection, and pandemics.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P25_S16	Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our services, client and user satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain clients and users, and, ultimately, our profits.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In the foreign countries where we operate, local laws and customs may differ from those in the U.S.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, it may be a local custom in certain countries for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We cannot guarantee that our employees, contractors, and agents will comply with all of our compliance policies and procedures.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we or our employees, contractors, or agents fail to comply with the legal requirements, government authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our continued growth.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Competition for such personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and software engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S7	We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S9	In addition, our search for replacements for departed employees may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, impact employee hiring and retention, and adversely impact our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S11	In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they may receive in connection with their employment.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S12	Volatility in the price of our stock or failure to obtain stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under our equity plans may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P26_S13	If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If we acquire or invest in companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions or investments, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We may not successfully use the acquired technology to accelerate the development of our service offerings and integrate acquired service offerings and realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, aggregate margin dilution, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, additional amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, any of which could harm our financial condition, operating results, or value of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Our operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature in the short term, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue and profitability.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls, lower-than-expected revenue increases as a result of planned expenditures, and longer-than-expected impact on profitability and margins as a result of planned expenditures may decrease our gross margins and profitability and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S7	If the revenue of our clients decreases, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts or certain services, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Under most of our client contracts, we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P30_S9	Many factors may lead to decreases in client revenue, including:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Changes in economic conditions and government requirements may increase the likelihood of several of these factors.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	For example, patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods based upon the economic climate.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government healthcare programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid or initiatives under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which we refer to as the ACA, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Also, although we currently estimate our expected client life for clients of athenahealth-branded services to be 12 years, this is only an estimate, and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Our clients typically purchase one-year contracts that, in most cases, may be terminated without cause, typically with a prescriptive notice period.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S9	The majority of our clinical information subscriptions have terms of one year, and our contracts with our market research, payer, and pharmaceutical clients for our interactive services typically have one-year terms.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S10	We cannot assure you that members of our Epocrates network and other Epocrates-branded services clients will continue to participate in our existing programs beyond the terms of their existing contracts or that they will enter into any additional contracts for new programs that we offer.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S11	If our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons, or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts or certain services, our revenue will decrease.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S12	If we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in various jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses, and our future sales may decrease.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P31_S13	We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe that our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, we voluntarily approach state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the states in which such taxes are imposed.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	The incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with, and the assessment of, taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P33_S6	As a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles for our athenahealth services, and the uncertainty as to the timing of fulfillment of our Epocrates services, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The sales cycle for our athenahealth services can be variable, typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution, although this period can be substantially longer.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation, although some of our new-client set-up projects especially those for larger clients are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Each client s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Even if implementation has begun, there can be no assurance that we will recognize revenue on a timely basis or at all from our efforts.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Implementation for a given client may be canceled.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	In addition, implementation may be delayed, or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future, for a variety of reasons, including the needs and requirements of the client, delays with payer processing, and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	If implementation periods are extended, our provision of our athenahealth services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed, and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S8	In regard to our Epocrates-branded services, the time between the date of the signing of the contract with a pharmaceutical client for a program, the actual fulfillment of the services under such contract and the revenue pattern associated with such revenues may be lengthy, especially for larger contracts with multiple deliverables, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including those that result from that client s need for internal approvals.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S9	These factors may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S10	As a result, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S11	Because we recognize revenue from our drug and clinical reference tool subscriptions and certain of our interactive services over the term or at the end of the service period, a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results, which may make it more difficult to evaluate our prospects.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S12	We recognize revenue from our Epocrates subscription agreements monthly over the terms of these agreements, which are typically one year.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S13	In most cases, we recognize revenue from our interactive services over the terms of these agreements or upon delivery of each service element.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S14	As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from subscription and service agreements entered into during prior periods.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S15	Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions or service agreements in any one quarter may not materially affect our financial performance in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P34_S16	In addition, we may be unable to adjust our costs, many of which are fixed, in response to reduced revenue.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make our reported results less indicative of our future prospects.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	RISKS RELATED TO OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS Our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our applications from operating properly.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If our systems do not function reliably or fail to achieve user or client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us or attempt to cancel their contracts with us, and members could choose to terminate their use of our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or retain clients and members.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained, and may in the future develop or contain, undetected defects, vulnerabilities, or errors.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Errors may result from sources beyond our control, including the receipt, entry, or interpretation of patient information; interface of our services with legacy systems that we did not develop; or errors in data provided by third parties.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S7	It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients or members may deploy or rely upon.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Therefore, despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes following introduction to the market.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S9	For example, changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error, so we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S10	Because clients rely on our services to collect, manage, and report clinical, business, and administrative data, including information to assist providers in tracking and treating ill patients, and members rely on our services to provide timely and accurate information regarding medical conditions and medicines, they may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S11	Any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby give rise to a product liability claim or errors or omissions claim.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S12	Such claims could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of those claims.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P36_S13	Limitations of liability and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software or content which we may include in our subscription and services agreements may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from related claims.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In most cases, we maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In light of this, defects, vulnerabilities, and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share; liability to clients, members, their patients, or others; failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion; diversion of development and management resources; delays in the introduction of new services; injury to our reputation; and increased service and maintenance costs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Defects, vulnerabilities, or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients or members from purchasing services from us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Correction of defects, vulnerabilities, or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The costs incurred in correcting any defects, vulnerabilities, or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If our security measures are breached or fail or unauthorized access is obtained to a client s or member s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients and members may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our services involve the web-based storage and transmission of clients and members proprietary information, including personal or identifying information and protected health information of patients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of software used in connection with our services are very important.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce client confidence and require substantial resources to address.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client, member, or patient data.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We rely upon users of our systems for key activities to promote security of those systems and the data within them, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	On occasion, our users have failed to perform these activities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Failure of users to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales, clients, and members.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In addition, we use third-party technology and service providers, and our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their patients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	For example, we depend on third-party service providers for processing claims data and clinical documents for our clients and we partner with other healthcare information technology companies to offer our clients more seamless integration with those companies through electronic interfaces.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Vendor management programs, security obligations imposed upon third-party technology and service providers, contractual security obligations of third-party technology and service providers, and processes for assessment of our partners' information security which we have designed cannot provide absolute security.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our clients may have their own computer systems, devices (including mobile devices), or servers (whether internally developed or provided by a third party) to manage, store, and transmit clinical and financial data, which may interact with or contain information obtained from our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Because we do not control our vendors , partners , or clients or clients users information security systems, devices, or servers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of these systems, devices, or servers.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	A security breach of our vendors , partners , or clients system, device, or server may damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to cancel their contracts, and/or subject us to third-party lawsuits, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	This could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data, including our ability to provide such data to third parties that are incorporated into our service offerings.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Furthermore, this may cause us to breach obligations to a third party to whom we may provide such data, such as third-party service or technology providers that are incorporated into our service offerings.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S8	In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission, or waiver.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S10	These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S11	Various events could interrupt users access to our systems, exposing us to significant costs or reducing our operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S12	The ability to access our systems is critical to our clients administration of care, cash flow, and business viability.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S13	Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) terrorism and acts of war; (iv) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our systems or those of others; and (v) computer viruses, ransomware, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our systems or those of others.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S14	If users access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to those clients or medical information relevant to patient care.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S15	Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely in part upon third-party providers of related services, and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S16	Additionally, our existing contracts with our clients include commitments related to the availability of our offerings and we are obligated to issue credits to our clients if we do not meet those commitments.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P41_S17	Our business interruption insurance only covers some, but not all, of these potential events, and even for those events that are covered, it may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events, including, for example, loss of market share and diminution of our brand, reputation, and member and client loyalty.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In addition, even in the absence of direct damage to our operations, large natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other unanticipated catastrophes could have a significant impact on our clients and partners businesses, which in turn could negatively impact our results of operations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Furthermore, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We rely on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation, potentially require us to issue credits to our clients, and negatively impact our relationships with users or clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we serve our clients primarily from third-party data-hosting facilities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S6	They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Their systems and servers could also be subject to hacking, ransomware, viruses, and other disruptive problems or vulnerabilities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S9	Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S10	Our ability to deliver our internet- and telecommunications-based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet and other telecommunications services by third parties.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P43_S11	This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable internet access and services and reliable mobile device, telephone, facsimile, and pager systems, all at a predictable and reasonable cost.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment or service providers, to provide our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users or clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Any disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We exercise limited control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and clients, adversely affect our brands and business, and expose us to third-party liabilities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	The insurance coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The reliability and performance of the internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	These outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet-based services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Finally, recent changes in law could impact the cost and availability of necessary internet infrastructure.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Increased costs and/or decreased availability would negatively affect our results of operations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P46_S5	We are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients, payers, and others.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Features and safeguards we have implemented to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	payers, we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims and regulatory action, which could damage our reputation with clients and increase our expenses and/or subject us to corrective action plans imposed by regulators which could negatively affect our operations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, we could have liability to clients, members, clinicians, or patients, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our software, content, and services are used to support clinical decision-making by providers and deliver information about patient medical histories, treatment plans, medical conditions, and the use of particular medications.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If our software, content, or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or we are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment, then clients, members, clinicians, or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry, and cause demand for our services to decline.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our athenaClinicals service is utilized by our clients during their clinical decision-making, provides access to patient medical histories, and assists in creating patient treatment plans, including the issuance of prescription drugs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Therefore, if these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us by clients, clinicians, patients, or others.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We often have little control over data accuracy, yet a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our Epocrates clinical reference tools and interactive services provide healthcare professionals with access to clinical information, including information regarding particular medical conditions and the use of particular medications.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, or we introduce inaccuracies in the process of implementing third-party content, it is possible that patients, physicians, consumers, the providers of the third-party content, or others may sue us if they are harmed as a result of such inaccuracies.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content, and we have had content errors in the past.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages, have our members assume responsibility for clinical treatment, diagnoses, medical oversight and dosing decisions; and require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols, and data.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, be binding upon patients, or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Furthermore, general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S7	In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S8	One or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P50_S9	If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, or changes to existing laws and regulations, including the potential amendment or repeal of all or parts of the ACA, could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information and interactive services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate, particularly as we develop and release new and more sophisticated products and services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Some of the risks we face from healthcare regulation are described below: False or Fraudulent Claim Laws .
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws that prohibit submission of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In some cases, these laws also prohibit abuse in connection with such submission and payment.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability (including, but not limited to, criminal liability), adversely affect demand for our services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claim information or inaccurate submission of information or certifications related to government quality measures or programs, whether by us or our clients, may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S5	In most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S6	To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S7	The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which we refer to as CMS, has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to engage in or overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S8	In addition, we may contract with third parties that offer software and services relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S9	Submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P54_S10	Our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to those clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	HIPAA and other Health Privacy Regulations .
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	There are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In particular, HIPAA includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	HIPAA also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice, and eligibility inquiries.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Because we translate electronic transactions to and from HIPAA-prescribed electronic formats and other forms, we are considered a clearinghouse and, as such, a covered entity subject to HIPAA.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P56_S4	In addition, our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	access by the HHS to our internal practices, books, and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	For example, the provisions of the HITECH Act and the regulations issued under it (including the omnibus rule promulgated in January 2013) have provided clarification of certain aspects of both the privacy and security rules issued under HIPAA, expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the security rule, and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with HIPAA.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In addition, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, which we refer to as ONCHIT, is coordinating the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the healthcare sector.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We are unable to predict what, if any, impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P58_S5	In addition, some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P58_S6	Where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions, and their interpretations are no less stringent than ours, we may seek to comply with their interpretations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The HIPAA transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Since these codes are selected or approved by our clients, and since we generally do not verify their propriety, some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of those clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Among our services, we provide automated reminder services to patients, internet- and telephone-based access to medical test results, pager and email notification to practices of patient calls, and patient call answering services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In addition to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the HITECH Act requirements, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and other personally identifiable information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In addition to false claims and HIPAA requirements, we are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes, including:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to healthcare providers and patients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	For example, the federal healthcare programs anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase, or order of any item, good, facility, or service covered by these programs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Moreover, both federal and state laws prohibit bribery and similar behavior.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients, vendors, or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our service fees, disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, subject us to corrective action plans imposed by regulators, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Legislation relating to payments to physicians .
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Legislation enacted or pending in several states and enacted at the federal level as part of the ACA and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 mandates public disclosure of, or otherwise regulates or limits the providing of, certain gifts and payments by pharmaceutical companies to physicians.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	These laws may be interpreted to cover honorarium payments made to physicians for participation in market research activities sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Because we currently provide market research services involving participants from our member network, the increased adoption and enforcement of these laws and the application of any public disclosure requirements or other limitations may have a negative impact on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to sponsor these activities or the willingness of physicians to participate in the market research.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	We cannot predict how pharmaceutical companies or physicians will respond when such legislation becomes more widespread or becomes effective at the federal level.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P64_S5	A significant decline in the sponsorship of our market research services by pharmaceutical companies or the agencies that represent such companies, or a significant decline in physicians willingness to participate in such studies could negatively impact our operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with healthcare providers.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	These vary widely from state to state, and one of the federal anti-referral laws the Stark Law is very complex in its application.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practice clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P65_S4	This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws and Fee-Splitting Laws .
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non-physicians, such as business corporations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In some states, including New York, these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non-physicians or others.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws, which may make our services less desirable to potential clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P67_S5	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	There are federal and state laws that prohibit or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government-funded programs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In some cases, these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our practice clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our service fees, and have an adverse effect on our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions, including electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies, and dispensing of medication, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws, drug control regulations, and state department of health regulations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	States have differing prescription format requirements, and, due in part to recent industry initiatives, federal law and the laws of all 50 states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Regulatory authorities such as the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and EHR technologies.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Some of these standards must be implemented and maintained by our clients; however, we cannot ensure our clients will do so, even if we contractually impose such an obligation.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Any determination that we or our practice clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability, loss of reputation, and loss of business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P69_S5	These laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	A number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems, including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	As a company that provides Electronic Health Records functionality, which we refer to as EHR, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation, we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P70_S3	We cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The software component of our athenaClinicals service was certified as a 2014 Edition compliant Complete EHR by an ONC-ATCB in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the HHS.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	However, such certification does not represent an endorsement of our athenaClinicals service by HHS or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We cannot be certain that our system will meet future requirements.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our services include the manual and electronic transmission of medical practice claims for reimbursement from payers.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a claim to any payer (including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, and any private health plans and managed care plans) that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	To the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others, we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our practice clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for healthcare services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	These laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission, payment, and appeal steps.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	They frequently also define and require clean claims.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Failure to meet these requirements and time frames may result in rejection or delay of claims.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by practice clients.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities from practicing medicine.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We employ and contract with physicians who provide only medical information to our users, some of whom may be consumers, and we do not intend to provide medical care, treatment, or advice.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Any determination that we are a healthcare provider and acted improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Regulation of drug and medical device advertising and promotion .
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We provide services involving promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Any increase in regulation of these areas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA; the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC; or other governmental bodies at the federal, state, or local level, could make it more difficult for us to contract for certain of our interactive services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Physician groups and others have criticized the FDA s current policies and have called for restrictions on advertising of prescription drugs and for increased FDA enforcement.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In response, the FDA has conducted hearings and sought public comment regarding its regulation of information concerning drugs on the internet and the relationships between pharmaceutical companies and those disseminating information on drugs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	We cannot predict what actions the FDA or industry participants may take in response to these criticisms.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P78_S3	It is also possible that new laws would be enacted that impose restrictions on such marketing and advertising.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Our interactive services revenues could be significantly reduced by additional restrictions on the marketing or advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices, whether imposed by law or regulation or by policies adopted by industry members.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	If the FDA, the FTC, or another governmental body finds that any information available on our website or distributed by us violates the FDA, the FTC, or other laws or regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state s consumer protection statutes or other new or existing laws.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The FDA may regulate medical or health-related software if such software falls within the definition of a device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FFDCA ).
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	However, the FDA exercises enforcement discretion for certain low risk software, as described in its guidance documents for Mobile Medical Applications, General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices, and Medical Device Data Systems, Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, in December of 2016, President Obama signed into law the 21st Century Cures Act, which included exemptions for certain medical-related software, including software used for administrative support functions at a healthcare facility, software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, and EHR software, software for transferring, storing, or displaying medical device data or in vitro diagnostic data, and certain clinical decision support software.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P80_S3	The FDA has also issued draft guidance documents to clarify how it intends to interpret and apply the new exemptions under the 21st Century Cures Act.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Although we believe that our software products are currently not subject to active FDA regulation, we continue to follow the FDA s developments in this area.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	There is a risk that the FDA could disagree with our determination or that the FDA could develop new final guidance documents that would subject our products to active FDA oversight.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	premarket and post-market requirements, and we would need to bring the affected technologies into compliance with such requirements.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Depending on the functionality and FDA classification of our software products, we may be required to:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and others relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing software development controls and quality assurance processes.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the United States may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Federal or state, as well as international, governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, storage, transmission, and other disclosures of health information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level, and may exist in international jurisdictions, that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use, storage, or transmission of medical information outside of the United States.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Such legislation, if adopted, may render our use of our off-shore partners, such as our data-entry and client service providers, for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive, and may increase our compliance costs and potential liability in foreign jurisdictions.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Alternative processing of such information within the United States may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost of operations which could negatively impact our cash flow.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Due to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to government regulation unrelated to healthcare.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	While our services are primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to healthcare, certain aspects of those services may require us to comply with regulatory schemes from other areas.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Examples of such regulatory schema include: Anti-spam Laws .
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P86_S3	We may be required to comply with current or future anti-spam legislation by limiting or modifying some of our interactive services, such as our clinical messaging, which may result in a reduction in our revenue.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	One such law, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM, became effective in the United States on January 1, 2004.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	CAN-SPAM imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with the sending of commercial e-mail.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	CAN-SPAM or similar laws may impose burdens on our member communication practices and on certain of our services, which in turn could harm our ability to attract new payer and pharmaceutical clients and increase revenues.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Our national cloud-based network allows us access to cost and pricing data for a large number of providers in most regional markets, as well as to the contracted rates for third-party payers.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	To the extent that our services enable providers to compare their cost and pricing data with those of their competitors, those providers could collude to increase the pricing for their services, to reduce the compensation they pay their employees, or to collectively negotiate agreements with third parties.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Similarly, if payers are able to compare their contracted rates of payment to providers, those payers may seek to reduce the amounts they might otherwise pay.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P88_S5	Such actions may be deemed to be anti-competitive and a violation of federal antitrust laws.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P88_S6	To the extent that we are deemed to have enabled such activities, we could be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice or the FTC and be required to curtail or terminate the services that permitted such collusion.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	As a billing service that offers patient communication and registration services, our employees or those of our service providers may from time to time come into contact with patients who owe our clients outstanding amounts.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Communications with patients that relate to amounts owed may be deemed to subject us or our service providers to federal or state debt collection laws and regulations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Such laws and regulations, if deemed to apply to us, are continually evolving and could require registration with government agencies and compliance with significant administrative obligations ( e.g. , to maintain an in-state office with local employees), which could result in increased expenses and subject us to fines and penalties for violation.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use, and dissemination of data, and the presentation of website or other electronic content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security, and access.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Courts may also adopt these developing standards.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	number of states, including California, have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the release of credit card or other personal information received from consumers.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	In addition, several foreign governments have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	For example, the European Union, or EU, adopted the Data Protection Directive, or DPD, imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will be in force in May 2018, has extra-territorial provisions requiring all non-EU countries offering goods or services to EU residents to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Similarly, Canada s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P91_S5	As another example, India has amended the Information Technology Act and adopted the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 to provide extra territorial provisions for protecting personal data or information and sensitive personal data or information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 enable Indian citizens to protect their personal data by placing requirements to be adhered to by any entities collecting, receiving, possessing, storing, dealing, and handling of their information in India for the safety of the personal data being collected, shared, and processed.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Foreign governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities, and our practice management services for practices along the Canadian border and our market research services could each involve the personal information of foreign residents.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Furthermore, in the conduct of our market research activities outside of the United States, we rely upon a third party to identify and recruit respondents for the market research and to comply with the applicable privacy laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S3	We cannot assure you that this third party will successfully comply with such laws or that we would not be responsible for any failure of this third party to comply.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S4	We cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S5	Whether and how existing local and international privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the internet and other online technologies is still uncertain and may take years to resolve.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S6	Privacy laws and regulations, if drafted or interpreted broadly, could be deemed to apply to the technology we use and could restrict our information collection methods or decrease the amount and utility of the information that we would be permitted to collect.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S7	The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or services, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S8	In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices, or those of our agents, do not meet these standards could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S9	Errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S10	We require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S11	We also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S12	Failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P92_S13	If participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients, our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	These relationships take different forms under different contractual language.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Some relationships help us identify sales leads.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Other relationships permit third parties to act as value-added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P94_S2	In some cases, for example in the case of some membership organizations, these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P94_S3	In each of these cases, we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P94_S4	If these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient, sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided, as well as the channel relationships themselves, may not be enforceable, may be unwound, and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P94_S5	Third parties that, despite our requirements, exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients, occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients, or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	contractual requirements, or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S1	This misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require a costly response from us, impair our ability to attract and maintain clients, and adversely affect our business.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Our services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S4	Among other things, our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients, and this mail frequently includes original checks and credit card information and occasionally includes currency.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S5	Even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S6	If any of our employees or subcontractors takes, converts, or misuses such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S7	In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents, or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S8	Subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand if we do not participate in such programs.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S9	In the past few years, various entities and federal programs have provided subsidies for services similar to ours, including EHR initiatives.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S10	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to qualify for and participate in such subsidy programs in the future.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S11	To the extent that we do not participate in such programs, demand for our services may be reduced, which may decrease our revenues.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S12	The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S13	The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or unrelated to our operating performance.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P95_S14	In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P96_S2	This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs; divert our management s attention and resources; and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P96_S4	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P96_S5	These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	the ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our by-laws.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P97_S2	As our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P97_S3	Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally an entity that, together with its affiliates, owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S3	We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, stockholders ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S4	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S5	We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S6	Therefore, investors are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
1131096_18_ITEM1A_P98_S7	There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.
1131096_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters is located in Watertown, Massachusetts on the Arsenal on the Charles campus, which we own.
1131096_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Arsenal on the Charles is a 29-acre, multi-building, commercial property, which includes approximately 697,000 square feet of office space and approximately 71,000 square feet of retail space.
1131096_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We currently occupy 551,984 square feet of these facilities and lease the remainder to third parties.
1131096_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	Additionally, we own a complex of buildings, including approximately 210,400 square feet of office space, on approximately 53 acres of land in Belfast, Maine, as well as a conference and training facility on approximately 396 acres of land in Northport, Maine.
1131096_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	We lease the remainder of our facilities in various locations in the United States, including: Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Princeton, New Jersey; and San Francisco, California, which we currently sublease; as well as in Bangalore, India; Chennai, India; and Pune, India.
1131096_18_ITEM2_P1_S4	Additionally, we operate data centers nationwide.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	On May 21, 2015, a class action petition was filed by St. Louis Heart Center, Inc. in the State Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, against athenahealth.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	The petition alleges we violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	Following service, we removed the case to federal court in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Case No. 4:15-cv-01215.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	After filing our answer in the case on March 8, 2016, we moved for and obtained a stay of the action pending a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Bais Yaakov of Spring Valley v. FCC , No. 14-1234, regarding the validity of a regulation promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, relating to the claims asserted in the petition.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P0_S4	On March 31, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its decision, invalidating the FCC regulation in question.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P0_S5	On April 7, 2017, we notified the federal court of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision in Bais Yaakov .
1131096_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	review of the D.C. Circuit's decision in Bais Yaakov .
1131096_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	On September 5, 2017, a petition for a writ of certiorari as to the D.C. Circuit's decision in Bais Yaakov was filed with the United States Supreme Court, which remains pending.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	In addition, from time to time we may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
1131096_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	We do not, however, currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ATHN.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 30, 2018 was $127.59 per share.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of January 30, 2018 , we had 72 holders of record of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P1_S3	Dividends We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P1_S4	We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P1_S5	Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	Performance Graph The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	Set forth below is a graph comparing the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the NASDAQ Composite-Total Returns Index and the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 , assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None.
1131096_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the quarter ended December 31, 2017 , there were no purchases made by us, on our behalf, or by any affiliated purchasers of shares of our common stock.
1131096_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables summarize our consolidated financial data for the periods presented.
1131096_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	You should read the following financial information together with the information under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to these consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes to these financial statements, and the other financial information that appears elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding management's expectations for future financial and operational performance and operating expenditures, expected growth, and business outlook; statements regarding the implementation, timing, and impact of the Plan (as defined below); the benefits of and demand for our service offerings; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; seasonality and changes in seasonality of our business; increased automation; changes in expenses related to operations, selling and marketing, research and development, general and administrative matters, depreciation and amortization, interest, and income taxes; statements regarding competition; statements regarding the impact of new legislation, including new tax legislation; the impact of litigation; the impact of foreign currency fluctuations; the impact of acquisitions and associated measurements of fair value; and liquidity matters.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements may be identified with words such as will, may, expect, plan, anticipate, upcoming, believe, estimates, or similar terminology, and the negative of these terms.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees of future performance, and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	These factors include, among other things, those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Overview athenahealth, Inc. (which we refer to as athenahealth, the Company, we, or our) partners with hospital and ambulatory clients to drive clinical and financial results.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	We offer network-based medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services, as well as Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our network provides clients better insight into their own organizations as well as the ability to learn from the experience of every other client on the network.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Through our model, we infuse the knowledge clients need to thrive in a changing industry directly into their workflow, from clinical guidelines to payer rules.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	We take on back-office work at scale so providers can focus on patients, not paperwork.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	We deliver the majority of our service offerings through a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S6	By combining our commitment to opening up the network, multiplying our intelligence, and freeing people to do what matters, we help healthcare providers leverage technology to automate certain back-office tasks, assist at the point of care, and adapt to changes in government regulatory schemes or the billing requirements of payers.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S7	We believe that including our clients on the same instance of software creates a network effect that enables each client to benefit from the collective experience of other clients.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P3_S8	As our network grows, we believe these benefits expand and we can further multiply intelligence for all clients on the network.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	athenaNet acts as a conduit for the exchange of information among clients, payers, trading partners, and our own experienced team.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	It enables us to learn continuously, innovate with agility, and deliver near-instant updates that we believe rapidly improve performance for our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition, our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	This work ranges from receiving, scanning, and delivering faxes to tracking claims with payers and managing denials.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	We automate this work whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work at massive scale with our internal team.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	The knowledge we gain from doing work for our clients and discovering ways to improve their performance is culled, curated, and captured within athenaNet through mechanisms that include our proprietary billing rules engine and clinical quality management engine.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S6	Using this knowledge, we also proactively coach our clients on best practices to help improve their performance.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S7	As we work with clients, payers, and other industry trading partners, more knowledge is infused into each service, which we believe makes athenaNet "smarter" and more powerful for our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P4_S8	This unique combination of opening up the network, multiplying our intelligence, and freeing people to do what matters is fundamental to our service model and value proposition to clients.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , we generated revenue of $1,220.3 million , compared to $1,082.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $924.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Given the scope of our market opportunity, we have also increased our spending each year on growth, innovation, and infrastructure.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our revenue is predominately derived from core athenahealth-branded business services.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	In most cases, we charge clients a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients, connecting our financial results directly to those of our clients and our ability to drive revenue to medical practices.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	Therefore, the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of providers working within our client accounts, the collections of these providers, and the number of services purchased.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	To provide these services, we incur expenses in several categories, including cost of revenue, selling and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expense.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	In general, our cost of revenue increases as our volume of work increases, whereas our selling and marketing expense correlates with current and expected market demand.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	Our research and development and general and administrative expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future and our overall business management activities.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P6_S6	We manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity and to ensure adherence to related financial covenants.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained, and as our operating environment changes.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and assumptions and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	Additionally, we may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies, as they require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	All revenue, other than certain non-refundable, upfront fees, is recognized when the service is performed.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	We derive the majority of our revenue from business services associated with our integrated, network-enabled services.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our integrated services consist of medical billing and practice management; electronic health record, or EHR; patient engagement; order transmission and care coordination; and population health management, which are supported by our network, athenaNet.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our clients typically purchase one-year service contracts related to our integrated, network-enabled services that renew automatically.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements without cause by providing notice, generally over a time period prescribed in a client's contract.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our clients are billed monthly, in arrears, typically based upon a percentage of collections posted to our network; minimum fees; flat fees; or per-claim fees, where applicable.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the subsequent month.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	For most of our clients, amounts due are then deducted from a pre-defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto-debit transaction.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue, and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Certain expenses related to the implementation of a client, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the client.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	This is accounted for as both revenue and expense in the period the cost is incurred.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Determining whether and when some of our revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied often involves judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We do not recognize revenue for business services associated with our integrated network-enabled services until collections received by our clients are posted to their accounts, as the fees are not fixed or determinable until such time.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period related to certain non-refundable, upfront fees associated with our integrated network-enabled services requires management to make estimates and judgments on the expected client life.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	We determined the expected client life considering the following key factors: - Renewal rate considerations - Economic life of the service The expected client life, or expected performance period, for the years presented is 12 years.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments is reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our estimate of the expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The amount of deferred revenue related to certain non-refundable, upfront fees is $55.1 million and $57.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	However, upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, we expect that this will no longer be a critical judgment, as the accounting for these fees will change.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Business Combinations, including purchased intangible assets, are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Measurement period adjustments relate to adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information that we should have known at the time of acquisition.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	All changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant s viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually on November 30 th or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets and the fair value of the reporting units during goodwill impairment tests include, but are not limited to, identifying reporting units, historical and projected client retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired clients, expected future cash outflows, the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, estimated useful lives of these intangible assets, and a probability-weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Testing finite-lived intangible assets for impairment includes significant judgment in the determination of the separate asset groups as well as the recoverability of those asset groups.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Management uses various assumptions when determining recoverability including, but not limited to, future cash flows, cash outflows necessary to obtain the cash inflows, and disposition of the asset group.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Testing goodwill for impairment includes significant judgment in the assessment of the number of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to the reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit based on management s best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management which sometimes include third-party valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	Management s best estimates and assumptions are employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P26_S5	Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill or intangible assets and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets, which are finite-lived assets.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $274.4 million and $108.6 million, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets were $240.7 million and $112.1 million, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	All of our software is considered internal use for accounting purposes, as we do not market or sell our software.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	As a result, we capitalize certain costs associated with the creation of internally-developed software for internal use (i.e., athenaNet).
1131096_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	These costs are recorded in the Capitalized Software Costs, net line on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of athenaNet services and other internally-developed software for internal use.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	Costs incurred during the application development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable that the development will result in new or additional functionality.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P28_S5	The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), as well as external consultant fees for individuals working on these projects.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P28_S6	Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Capitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life when the asset has been placed in service.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	We account for costs associated with internal-use software on a project-by-project basis during initial capitalization as well as subsequent measurement.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	Significant judgments related to the capitalization of internal use software costs include determining whether it is probable that projects will result in new or additional functionality; concluding on when the application development phase starts and ends; and estimating which costs, especially employee compensation costs, should be capitalized.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	Additionally, there is judgment applied to the useful lives of these capitalized costs; we have concluded that the useful life for capitalized internally-developed software ranges from two to five years.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	When internal-use software that was previously capitalized is abandoned, the cost less the accumulated amortization, if any, is recorded as amortization expense.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P29_S5	Fully amortized capitalized internal-use software costs are removed from their respective accounts.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	While we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments is reasonable, actual results could differ, and such differences could lead to an increase or decrease in expenses in the current period.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of internally-developed capitalized software were $115.7 million and $95.6 million, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Note that these totals exclude acquired third-party software licenses for internal use.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	We partner with hospital and ambulatory clients to drive clinical and financial results.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	We derive our revenue from two sources: business services, and implementation and other services.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Business services primarily consists of revenue from our athenaNet providers who use our network-enabled medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	Business services also includes revenue from Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	No single client accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S5	Business services revenue accounted for 97% , 97% , and 96% of our total revenues the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S6	Business services revenue for athenahealth-branded services is typically 2% to 8% of a practice s or health system s total collections depending upon the services purchased and the size, complexity, and other characteristics of the practice or health system.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P32_S7	Accordingly, business services revenue is largely driven by: the number of clients we serve, the number of physicians and other healthcare providers working in those practices, the volume of activity and related collections of those providers, the mix of our services used by those medical practices and healthcare providers, and our contracted rates.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	There is moderate seasonality in the activity level and service mix of healthcare providers.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Typically, discretionary use of healthcare provider services declines during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our healthcare provider clients in mid-January.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Based on the new revenue recognition guidance that we will adopt on January 1, 2018, we believe that the seasonality associated with the timing of when claims are submitted by our clients and when our clients receive payment on these claims will be reflected in our financial results with differing patterns than under today's recognition method.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Implementation and other revenue consists of all non-core revenue streams and includes the amortization of deferred revenue on non-refundable, upfront fees.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	We expect the amortization of deferred implementation fees to cease upon the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on January 1, 2018.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	Refer to Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	During 2017, we commenced a comprehensive plan, which we refer to as the Plan, designed to increase strategic focus and improve operational efficiency.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	The Plan is expected to generate $100 million to $115 million in gross pre-tax expense savings by the end of 2018.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	In connection with the Plan, we took steps to reduce our workforce by approximately 9%.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	Implementation of the Plan is expected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $15 million to $25 million by the end of 2018, primarily related to workforce reductions, most of which occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2017.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation expense related to personnel who provide services, including implementation of new clients and client support, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing arrangements and clearing house, software subscriptions, claim processing costs, certain overhead costs, depreciation of certain fixed assets, and amortization of capitalized software development costs and certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We currently expense implementation costs as incurred.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	However, we expect that upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, certain costs associated with implementation activities prior to go-live will be capitalized and amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the average expected customer life.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	We expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation with higher volumes of work in particular functions, lower cost geographies, and medical specialties, as well as streamlining and simplifying client support.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	However, we will continue to perform work on our clients behalf, which will require investments in the near future.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	We expect that cost of revenue will still increase in absolute terms; however, we expect that costs will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue compared to prior periods.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P36_S6	Due to the new revenue recognition guidance that we will adopt January 1, 2018, in initial years post-adoption, we will capitalize more implementation activities than we will amortize, resulting in a net benefit to cost of revenue; however, at the point at which the amortization of capitalized implementation activities equals the amount capitalized in the corresponding period, cost of revenue will no longer receive a benefit from the new revenue recognition guidance.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Selling and marketing expense primarily consists of compensation expense for selling and marketing employees, marketing programs (including trade shows, brand messaging, and online initiatives), certain overhead costs, depreciation of certain fixed assets, and amortization of certain purchased intangible assets.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Although we recognize substantially all revenue when services have been delivered, we recognize a portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and a portion at other milestone achievements.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Accordingly, we incur a portion of our selling and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	We expect that, upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, certain commissions will be capitalized and amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the average expected customer life.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	adjust our selling and marketing expenses to reflect today's market conditions, while reallocating resources to address the best opportunities to grow our market share.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	As a result, we expect that, in the near-term, selling and marketing expense will decline in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Research and development expense primarily consists of compensation expense for research and development employees, consulting fees for third-party developers, certain overhead costs, and depreciation of certain fixed assets.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	We expect that, in the near-term, research and development expenditures will increase in absolute terms and will likely remain constant or slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services; however, the amount of expenditures that will be capitalized as software costs versus expensed as research and development costs could vary based on the specific projects we undertake.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	General and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation expense for administrative employees, professional fees for third-party accountants, lawyers, and consultants, certain overhead expenses, and depreciation of certain fixed assets.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	We expect that general and administrative expense will decrease with the implementation of the Plan, but increase modestly in absolute terms over time as we make investments to support our growth.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	Though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms, we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest expense primarily consists of interest costs related to our term and revolving loans under our current credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing fees.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Other (expense) income consists of various expense and income items that are not part of our core business activities.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, other (expense) income primarily consists of gains realized from the sale of marketable securities in Castlight Health, Inc. Upon adoption of the new investment accounting standard as of January 1, 2018, we will be required to recognize gains and losses on our cost method investments in our statement of income.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	Such gains and losses could be volatile and significant depending upon the market activity of each investment.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Income tax provision includes the federal and state jurisdictions in the United States and India.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory tax rate has historically been driven by the amount of research and development credits we generate each year through the development of new and enhanced services offset by the amount of non-deductible (or permanent) differences and the amount of our pre-tax net income.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	On December 22, 2017, President Trump enacted H.R.1, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which, beginning in 2018, will reduce our corporate statutory rate but will increase certain permanent differences in the near term.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	As of the date of enactment, we have reduced our net deferred tax assets for our new statutory rate which has resulted in a decrease to our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	In the future, we expect the difference from our effective tax rate and our newly reduced statutory rate will be less than in the past as the amount of research and development credits that we will generate each year will be offset by higher non-deductible items related to highly compensated employees.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P43_S4	In addition, as we expect a higher pre-tax net income as a result of the Plan described above.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 :
1131096_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Percentages for each line item may not sum to the totals or subtotals for each fiscal year due to rounding.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased due to an increase in collections-based revenue.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in collections-based revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of clients we serve.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	The amount of collections processed was as follows:
1131096_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Cost of revenue increased primarily due to compensation costs and costs associated with our business partner outsourcing and clearing house activities.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Compensation costs increased $23.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 , largely due to a $16.9 million increase in salaries expense as a result of a 14% average headcount increase compared to December 31, 2016 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Compensation costs also includes a $6.3 million charge related to severance associated with the Plan, as we decreased headcount by 7% from the three months ended September 30, 2017 to the three months ended December 31, 2017.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	In addition, costs associated with our business partner outsourcing and clearing house activities increased $14.0 million, or 17%, as the number of claims that we processed on behalf of our clients increased during those same periods.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P47_S4	The total claims submitted on behalf of clients were as follows:
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Selling and marketing expense remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Compensation costs increased $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , which included $3.3 million in severance due to an 18% average decrease in headcount associated with the Plan during the three months ended December 31, 2017.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	That increase was offset by a $16.3 million decrease in marketing program spend for the year ended December 31, 2017 , as we pursued cost-saving opportunities.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	Research and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to compensation costs.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	Compensation costs increased $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , largely due to a 9% increase in headcount, as well as an increase in expensed versus capitalized projects from the year ended December 31, 2016.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	In addition, key employee retention costs associated with our acquisitions of Filament Labs, Inc., or Patient IO, and Praxify Technologies, Inc., or Praxify, contributed $7.1 million to research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	General and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the use of consultants.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S7	Consulting expense increased $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P48_S8	We used consultants in numerous capacities, including assistance in identifying significant cost-savings opportunities related to the Plan, temporarily staffing open positions, and assisting in our analysis and implementation of the new revenue recognition standard.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , is due to the H.R.1, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enactment, the adoption of the new stock-based compensation accounting standard, the release of a portion of our valuation allowance, and the increase in the amount of pre-tax net income.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Upon adoption of the new stock-based compensation guidance on January 1, 2017, we began recognizing excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies through the income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Prior to adoption, the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies were recorded to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet and excess tax benefits were not recorded until they were able to be utilized.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Refer to Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information on the impact on the adoption of this new accounting guidance.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	Refer to Note 11 Income Taxes for a further description of the H.R.1 enactment impact and our reconciliations of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased due to an increase in business services revenue.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase in business services revenue was primarily driven by the growth in the number of providers using our services.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Also contributing to this increase was the growth in related collections on behalf of these providers.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	The amount of collections processed was as follows:
1131096_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Cost of revenue increased primarily due to compensation costs, which increased $33.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of a 22% increase in headcount from December 31, 2015.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	We increased headcount due to the increase in the number of providers added to the network and the expansion of our emerging services.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	In addition, amortization expense increased $13.3 million due to an increase in new software functionality that we placed in service, such as certain projects associated with our athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems service, in the year ended December 31, 2016.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	Finally, cost of revenue increased $6.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 due to our investment in various software subscriptions necessary to support our clients and our operations.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Selling and marketing expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to increases in compensation costs and consulting fees.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.9 million, and was largely due to a 15% increase in headcount that was partially offset by a lower increase in variable compensation from December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	The increase in consulting fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.3 million.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	We hired additional sales personnel and utilized consultants to focus on adding new clients and increasing penetration within new and existing markets.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	Research and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to compensation costs and allocated amortization expense.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S5	Compensation costs increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to restructuring costs incurred for strategic re-alignment purposes during the three months ended December 31, 2016.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S6	In addition, research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by a $6.2 million increase in amortization expense related to capitalized software projects that were ultimately decided not to be placed in service.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P53_S7	General and administrative expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to professional services fees and compensation costs.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	increase of $5.8 million in professional service fees, which include legal and consulting fees.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	General and administrative expense was also impacted by a $3.7 million increase in facilities-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 , largely due to our growth.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Other (expense) income primarily relates to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and gains realized from the sale of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	The difference in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 , is primarily due to the increase in our research and development tax credits.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity As of December 31, 2017 , our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $165.1 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of $147.4 million as of December 31, 2016 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	In addition, we have a credit agreement, which we refer to as the 2015 Senior Credit Facility, that provides for a $500.0 million senior credit facility comprised of a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , we had $273.8 million and $292.5 million outstanding on the unsecured term loan facility, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	As of both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , we had $200.0 million available on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S4	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S5	We may increase the revolving credit facility up to an additional $100.0 million and may increase the term loan facility to the extent that such amount will not cause us to be in breach of our financial covenants (such as compliance with a consolidated fixed charge coverage, consolidated leverage, and consolidated senior leverage ratios), subject to certain conditions, including obtaining lender commitments.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S6	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility matures on May 5, 2020, although we may prepay the 2015 Senior Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S7	As of December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with our covenants under the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S8	Our cash balance increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to our cost savings program associated with implementation of the Plan.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S9	We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations, to make payments on our contractual obligations, and to purchase property and equipment in the foreseeable future.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S10	Our 2015 Senior Credit Facility, including our currently underutilized $200.0 million line of credit, provides additional flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives in the future, if needed.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S11	Our analysis is supported by the growth in our new client base and a high rate of renewal with our existing clients, as well as the corresponding increase in billings and collections.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P57_S12	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under these credit facilities or obtain additional financing.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Commitments We enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the 2018 fiscal year.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Operating Cash Flow Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in net income excluding the effect of non-cash items.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	There was a slight decrease in cash used from changes in our operating assets and liabilities, as our $16.5 million spend on prepaid retention payments associated with our acquisition of Praxify was largely offset by favorable timing in our accounts receivable, deferred revenue, and accounts payable accounts compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	We expect that, in the near-term, due to higher expected pre-tax net income as a result of the Plan, we will substantially utilize our remaining Federal and State net operating losses and our existing R D tax credits, and therefore, we will begin paying substantially more in income taxes.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a $24.2 million increase in payments on acquisitions, net of cash acquired, as a result of our purchase of Praxify.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	We expect to continue to invest in capitalized software costs as we continue to develop new and enhance existing services and in property and equipment as we continue to grow.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	The increase in net cash used in financing activities was $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to an additional $11.3 million in principal payments on our 2015 Senior Credit Facility in the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	In addition, net cash used in financing activities increased $9.0 million , as we no longer present excess tax benefits within cash flows from financing activities but instead present these cash flows in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, per a change in accounting guidance we adopted January 1, 2017.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that income taxes paid for the net settlement of restricted stock unit awards will be greater than the cash received for stock option exercises due to our stock price and the increase in the issuance of restricted stock units compared to stock options.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Operating Cash Flow Activities Net income after non-cash and reclassification adjustments contributed an additional $64.9 million to cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase in non-cash and reclassification adjustments was the result of a $24.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2016 and a $28.7 million gain on the sale of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	The increase in net income after non-cash and reclassification adjustments was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by working capital of $46.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	This decrease was primarily due to decreases in deferred revenue associated with implementations and in accrued compensation due to the timing of payments.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	In 2014, we began including implementation fees in our ongoing monthly rate as part of our go to market strategy, which resulted in a decrease in deferred revenue.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 , as 2016 required less cash for acquired third-party licenses and business acquisitions.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we acquired Filament Labs, Inc. (doing business as Patient IO) for $15.2 million (included in the payments on acquisitions, net of cash acquired line on the consolidated statements of cash flows).
1131096_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	consolidated statements of cash flows) and our purchase of WebOMR (a third-party license included in the capitalized software costs line on the consolidated statements of cash flows) in the year ended December 31, 2015 for $39.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	Net cash used in investing activities also decreased due to $29.8 million of cash provided from the sales of Castlight Health, Inc. stock in the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	In addition, net cash used for property and equipment additions decreased $18.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher spend, particularly in building improvements, in the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	The variance in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $105.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to net proceeds received from the 2015 Senior Credit Facility in the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM7_P65_S4	The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 :
1131096_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	(1) We have cash interest requirements due on the 2015 Senior Credit Facility payable at variable rates which are not included in the above table.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	(2) We are party to agreements for non-cancelable operating leases for office space and data centers which expire between 2018 and 2030.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	(3) We have entered into sublease agreements related to facilities included in operating lease obligations, and therefore, we expect that we will receive payments from such agreements which are not included in the above table.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Expected payments from these agreements are as follows:
1131096_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	(4) Other consists of uncertain tax benefits.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	We have not recognized these uncertain tax benefits, nor do we have an expectation of when these uncertain tax benefits would be challenged.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	Other than our operating leases, which are primarily for office space and data centers, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1131096_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Upon adoption of the new lease accounting guidance on January 1, 2019, we anticipate that the requirement to capitalize all long-term leases will result in a material impact to our consolidated balance sheet.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Indian rupee.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues is generated outside of the United States.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Some of our contracts with our offshore vendors are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, namely Indian rupees.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 , approximately 1-2% of our expenses occurred in our operations in India.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	therefore do not believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is likely.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We had $273.8 million and $292.5 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2015 Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The 2015 Senior Credit Facility bears interest at the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an interest margin based on (i) our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.
1131096_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A one hundred basis point change in the interest rate on our borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 would result in an annual change in interest expense of $2.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are located beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1131096_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

1131096_18_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In conducting this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2017 , our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , as stated in their report which appears herein.
1131096_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Changes in Internal Control There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the three months ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1131096_18_ITEM15_P8_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P8_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P8_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P9_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P9_S3	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P9_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

1131096_18_ITEM15_P17_S0	1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General athenahealth, Inc. (which we refer to as athenahealth, the Company, we, or our) partners with hospital and ambulatory clients to drive clinical and financial results.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P17_S1	We offer network-based medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services, as well as Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P17_S2	Our network provides clients better insight into their own organizations as well as the ability to learn from the experience of every other client on the network.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P17_S3	Through our model, we infuse the knowledge clients need to thrive in a changing industry directly into their workflow, from clinical guidelines to payer rules.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P17_S4	We take on back-office work at scale so providers can focus on patients, not paperwork.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P18_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P19_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition, including the expected client life; (2) asset impairments; (3) depreciable lives of assets; (4) fair value of stock-based compensation; (5) fair value of identifiable purchased tangible and intangible assets in a business combination; (6) determination of the reporting unit(s) for goodwill impairment testing; (7) litigation reserves; and (8) capitalized software costs.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P19_S2	Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P20_S0	Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker, which we refer to as the CODM, or decision-making group in assessing performance and making decisions regarding resource allocation.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P20_S1	We use consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, and have determined that we operate in one segment.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P20_S2	The CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, uses non-GAAP adjusted operating income (defined as the sum of GAAP net income before (provision for) benefit from income taxes; total other (expense) income; stock-based compensation expense; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development; amortization of purchased intangible assets; integration and transaction costs; exit costs, including restructuring costs; and gain or loss on investments) as the measure of our profit on a regular basis.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	We recognize revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the client, the collection of the fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P21_S1	We derive our revenue from two sources: business services, and implementation and other services.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P21_S2	Business services primarily consists of revenue from our athenaNet providers who use our network-enabled medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P21_S3	Business services also includes revenue from Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P21_S4	Our clients typically purchase one -year service contracts for our integrated, network-enabled services that renew automatically.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P21_S5	In most cases, our clients may terminate their agreements without cause by providing notice, generally over a time period prescribed in a client's contract.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	We bill our clients monthly, in arrears, based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenaNet, minimum fees, flat fees, or per-claim fees.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P22_S1	We do not recognize revenue for athenahealth-branded business services fees until client collections are posted, as the services fees are not fixed or determinable until such time.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P22_S2	Unbilled amounts that have been earned are accrued and recorded as revenue and are included in our accounts receivable balances.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	Implementation and other services revenue primarily consists of the amortization of deferred revenue on implementation fees.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P23_S1	Prior to 2014, these fees were billed upfront and recorded as deferred revenue until the implementation was complete, and then, as the service did not have stand-alone value, it was recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected client life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P23_S2	We evaluate the length of the amortization period of the implementation fees based on our experience with client contract renewals and consideration of the period over which those clients will receive benefits from our current portfolio of services.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	During 2014, we began to sell go-live and training support services separate from the required implementation services.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P24_S1	The client can purchase go-live and training support services from us or third-party vendors, and therefore, those services have stand-alone value and are recognized as those services are delivered.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P24_S2	When we began selling these services separately from the required implementation services, we began to include the fees associated with the required implementation services in our ongoing monthly rate; therefore, the required implementation services are being recognized ratably over the expected client life.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P24_S3	Previously deferred revenue balances related to implementation services that were billed upfront and did not have stand-alone value continue to be amortized over those remaining client lives.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P24_S4	Certain expenses related to the implementation, go-live, and training of a client, such as out-of-pocket travel, are typically reimbursed by the client.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P24_S5	These costs are recorded as both revenues and expenses in the period the costs are incurred.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	Research and Development Expense Research and development expense primarily consists of compensation expense for research and development employees and consulting fees for third-party developers.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P25_S1	All such costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain internal use software costs, which may be capitalized (refer to Note 6 Capitalized Software Costs).
1131096_18_ITEM15_P25_S2	Research and development expense also includes allocated amounts for overhead, depreciation, and amortization.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans; stock options; and restricted stock units with compensation cost measured using the fair value of the awards issued (refer to Note 10 Stock-Based Compensation).
1131096_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	We generally issue previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	Certain employees have received awards for which the ultimate number of shares that will be subject to vesting is dependent upon the achievement of certain financial targets for the year.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	Such determination is not made until the award s vesting determination date, which is the date our fiscal year financial statements are available for issuance.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P28_S2	The value of such awards are initially recorded based on the attainable number of shares that are most likely to be subject to vesting based on available financial forecasts as of the date of grant.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P28_S3	This amount is adjusted on a quarterly basis as new financial forecasts become available.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P28_S4	Stock based compensation expense for these awards is recorded over the requisite service period, which is generally three or four years.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P28_S5	Such awards generally vest ratably over three or four years from the vesting determination date.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	Advertising Expenses Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P29_S1	Advertising expense totaled $27.3 million , $30.6 million , and $28.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity from the Company s date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	Investments Management determines the classification of investments at the time of purchase based upon management s intent with regard to such investments.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	Our convertible notes receivable from privately-held companies are accounted for as available-for-sale investments which are carried at cost, which we believe approximates fair value.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P32_S1	Upon conversion, if any, we assess whether the resulting holdings in equity interests should be accounted for on a cost or equity method basis, depending on whether we believe we have significant influence over the investee, the type of equity interest held, and the level of equity interest held in the investee.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P32_S2	Marketable securities, if any, are also accounted for as available-for-sale investments and recorded at fair value.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P32_S3	Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P32_S4	The Company determines realized gains and losses based on the specific identification method.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P32_S5	Management monitors and assesses individual investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, notes receivable, and accounts receivable.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	We attempt to limit our credit risk associated with cash equivalents and investments by investing or making deposits in highly-rated corporate and financial institutions, and engaging with highly-rated financial institutions as counterparties to our derivative transactions.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P33_S2	With respect to client accounts receivable, we manage our credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P33_S3	No single client accounted for a significant amount of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 .
1131096_18_ITEM15_P33_S4	No single client accounted for a significant portion of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1131096_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represents unbilled amounts and amounts due from clients for business services.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts, which is determined by establishing reserves for specific accounts and consideration of historical and estimated probable losses.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:
1131096_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:
1131096_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	The cost of an asset consists of its purchase price and any necessary costs incurred to bring the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P38_S1	We capitalize certain costs incurred during the construction of an asset and record such costs in construction in progress until construction is completed.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P38_S2	Once the related asset is placed into service, we transfer its carrying value into the appropriate asset category and begin depreciating the value over its estimated useful life.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
1131096_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the applicable lease terms, excluding renewal periods.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P40_S1	Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P40_S2	When any assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	Capitalized Interest Cost Interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically capital costs related to the build-out of our corporate headquarters and capitalized internal-use software costs, are capitalized until each underlying asset is placed into service.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P41_S1	Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the capitalization rate by the qualifying costs.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P41_S2	Once the qualifying asset is placed into service, the cost of the qualifying asset and the related capitalized interest are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	Capitalized Software Costs We capitalize certain costs related to the development of athenaNet services and other internal-use software.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P42_S1	Costs incurred during the application development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable the development will result in new or additional functionality.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P42_S2	The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee compensation, as well as consulting fees for third-party developers working on these projects.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P42_S3	Costs related to the preliminary project stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from two to five years.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	When internal-use software that was previously capitalized is abandoned, the cost less the accumulated amortization, if any, is recorded as amortization expense.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P43_S2	Fully amortized capitalized internal-use software costs are removed from their respective accounts.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, as compared with the carrying value of the asset.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P44_S3	Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P44_S4	Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P44_S5	Subsequent to classification of an asset as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill annually on November 30.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P47_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P47_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Purchased Intangible Assets Most of our purchased intangible assets were acquired in connection with business acquisitions, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of economic benefit expected from each asset.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	We concluded for certain purchased intangible assets that the pattern of economic benefit approximated the straight-line method, and therefore, the use of the straight-line method was appropriate, as the majority of the cash flows will be recognized ratably over the estimated useful lives and there is no degradation of the cash flows over time.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	Accrued compensation and accrued expenses Accrued expenses consist of the following:
1131096_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	Commitments and Contingencies We are engaged from time to time in certain legal disputes arising in the ordinary course of business, including employment discrimination claims and challenges to our intellectual property.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	We believe that we have adequate legal defenses and that the likelihood of a loss contingency relating to the ultimate disposition of any of these disputes is remote.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P51_S2	When the likelihood of a loss contingency becomes at least reasonably possible with respect to any of these disputes, or, as applicable in the future, if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may have been incurred, we will revise our disclosures in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P51_S3	Additionally, we will accrue a liability for loss contingencies when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P51_S4	We will review these accruals and adjust them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P51_S5	To the extent new information is obtained, and our views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in our accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	We expense legal costs, including those incurred in connection with loss contingencies, as incurred.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	Exit Costs, Including Restructuring Costs Exit costs, including restructuring costs, represent costs related to workforce reductions and other charges related to strategic re-alignment.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	comprehensive plan, which we refer to as the Plan, designed to increase strategic focus and improve operational efficiency.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	Implementation of the Plan is expected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $15 million to $25 million , primarily related to workforce reductions.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P54_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge of $18.7 million associated with the Plan, of which $6.6 million , $3.4 million , $3.2 million , and $0.6 million of costs related to workforce reductions are included in cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense, respectively, and $4.9 million of non-cash charges related to other activities are included in general and administrative expense.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	In the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, management performed various activities that resulted in the Company incurring exit costs associated with workforce reductions and termination of leases and other agreements.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P55_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the costs related to workforce reductions are primarily included in research and development expenses and the costs related to termination of leases and other agreements are primarily included in general and administrative expenses.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P55_S2	The activity related to the exit cost accrual during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consist of the following:
1131096_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	Deferred revenue largely includes amounts associated with sponsored clinical information and decision support services which are recognized as services are performed and pre-2014 implementation services fees which continue to be recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the life of the agreement or the expected client life, which is currently estimated to be 12 years.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P56_S2	Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P56_S3	The treatment of these fees has not been adjusted for expected changes as a result of new accounting pronouncements that will be adopted as of January 1, 2018, as described below.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of rent escalation, tenant improvement allowances, and other incentives received from landlords related to the operating leases for our facilities.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	Rent escalation represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight-line rent expense, which we record over the term of the lease.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P57_S2	The excess is recorded as a deferred credit in the early periods of the lease, when cash payments are generally lower than straight-line rent expense, and is reduced in the later periods of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight-line expense.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Tenant allowances from landlords for tenant improvements are generally comprised of cash received from the landlord or paid on our behalf as part of the negotiated terms of the lease.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	These tenant improvement allowances and other incentives are recorded when realizable as deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction of periodic rent expense over the term of the applicable lease.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Preferred Stock Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	Our Board of Directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P59_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on our common stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of our common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P59_S3	The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P59_S4	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	Common Stock Common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share and dividends, when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to any preferential rights of preferred stockholders.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for at fair value.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	The associated acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; non-controlling interests, if any, are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development, if any, is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed; contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings; changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period affect income tax expense; and goodwill is determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P62_S2	If the actual results differ from our estimates and judgments, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	The results of the acquired businesses operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the combined entity beginning on the date of acquisition.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	Related Party Transactions We have a long-term investment in Access Healthcare Services Private Limited, or Access, a vendor that provides business partner outsourcing services for us.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P64_S1	The total expense related to this vendor for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $62.4 million , $41.1 million , and $23.6 million , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P64_S2	Expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects $61.9 million in cost of revenue and $0.5 million in research and development expense.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P64_S3	The total amount payable related to this vendor at December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million .
1131096_18_ITEM15_P64_S4	The total amount accrued for this vendor at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $5.7 million and $4.6 million , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Our contractual obligations with Access include a purchase obligation that limits our ability to decrease our purchased services more than 33% from the previous calendar year's volume.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P65_S1	A member of our Board of Directors also serves as a director of one of our clients.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P65_S2	The total revenue recognized for this client for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $19.3 million , $14.4 million , and $9.9 million , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P65_S3	The total receivables related to this client were $3.5 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect at the time of their reversal.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	Any change in an enacted tax rate would result in a charge or credit to the income tax provision.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce net deferred tax assets if, based on the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P67_S1	In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P67_S2	We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P67_S3	Our income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the balance sheet date to be recognized in the related period.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	Sales and Use Taxes Our services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P69_S1	Our contractual agreements with clients provide that payment of any sales or use tax assessments is the responsibility of the client.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	In certain jurisdictions, sales taxes are collected from the client and remitted to the respective agencies.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	These taxes are recorded on a net basis and excluded from revenue and expense in our financial statements as presented.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	Incentives Received from Governmental Bodies From time to time, we receive incentives from various government agencies and programs.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	We account for the portion of the credits that are expected to be used as grants by reducing general and administrative expense.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P71_S2	Credits which are expected to be used to reduce general and administrative expense are recognized when the requirements to earn the credits have been met.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P71_S3	We recognized $3.3 million , $3.8 million , and $4.1 million from our participation in incentive programs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P73_S1	Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded within other comprehensive income (loss).
1131096_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	Employee Benefit Plan We sponsor a 401(k) retirement savings plan, which we refer to as the 401(k) Plan, under which eligible employees may contribute specified percentages of their compensation, subject to maximum aggregate annual contributions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	All employee contributions are allocated to the employee s individual account and are invested in various investment options as directed by the employee.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P74_S2	Employees cash contributions are fully vested and non-forfeitable.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P74_S3	We may make a discretionary contribution in any year, subject to authorization by our Board of Directors.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P74_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 , our contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $11.8 million , $11.3 million , and $5.3 million , respectively.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new guidance which changes the accounting for stock-based compensation.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S1	The guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S2	We adopted this standard on January 1, 2017, using a modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard to be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application, and which resulted in a cumulative-effect increase of $49.2 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S3	Upon adoption, we now recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S4	We no longer present excess tax benefits within cash flows from financing activities but instead present these cash flows in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S5	Prior to adoption, the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies were recorded to additional paid-in capital and excess tax benefits were not recorded until they were able to be utilized.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S6	In addition, we elected to no longer calculate an estimate of expected forfeitures and began recognizing forfeitures as they occurred, including a cumulative-effect decrease of $1.0 million to retained earnings at January 1, 2017 with the offset as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S7	New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers New revenue recognition guidance, which was issued in March 2014 and amended thereafter, is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S8	The new revenue standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S9	In addition, the new standard provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S10	While the impact of this standard will vary across our industry peers, our unique go-to-market strategy centered around charging a percentage of our clients collections for our services within athenaOne deals, combined with our offering that essentially provides a series of integrated services and our clients ability to terminate our services at a fixed number of days notice without a significant penalty, will result in additional complexity in our pattern of revenue recognition compared to the current revenue recognition pattern.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S11	We have reached conclusions on key accounting assessments and are substantially complete with the implementation of new processes for the accounting under the new standard.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P75_S12	These new processes include implementing a new information technology system and creating additional internal controls over financial reporting.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	Under today s accounting standards, the criterion impacting the timing of our revenue recognition is the requirement of fees to be either fixed or determinable; therefore, we do not recognize revenue for many athenaOne-based business services deals until these collections are posted, as the fees are not fixed or determinable until such time.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	The new guidance does not limit the recognition of revenue to only fees that are fixed or determinable.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P76_S2	Instead, the standard focuses on recognizing revenue as value is transferred to customers.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P76_S3	The impact on our athenaOne services offering is a revenue recognition and reporting model that reflects revenue recognized over time rather than delaying the recognition of revenue until the point in time in which the fees to be charged become determinable.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P76_S4	For athenaOne arrangements, we will estimate the value of the consideration we will earn over the remaining contractual period as our services are provided and recognize the fees over the term; this estimation will typically involve predicting the amounts our clients will ultimately collect associated with the services they provide with the assistance of athenaNet.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P76_S5	Because most of our contracts require our clients to provide a fixed number of days notice prior to terminating our services, our contractual term resets daily, requiring us to estimate the amount of consideration to be paid to us over the continuously changing period during which our contracts are legally enforceable and we are providing services.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P76_S6	As such, we believe certain estimates required to measure athenaOne-based revenue under the new standard will be significant estimates.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	Under the new standard, certain costs to obtain a contract and our contract fulfillment costs, which we currently expense, will be deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance or a longer period, generally the expected client life, if renewals are expected.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P77_S1	Costs to obtain a contract primarily relate to commissions paid to employees and third parties and contract fulfillment costs primarily relate to the implementation of a client.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	The new standard provides companies with two implementation methods.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P78_S1	Companies can choose to adopt the standard retrospectively and apply the guidance to each prior reporting period presented.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P78_S2	Alternatively, a modified retrospective adoption methodology is permitted, whereby the cumulative impact of all prior periods would be recorded in retained earnings or other impacted balance sheet line items as of January 1, 2018, the date of adoption.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P78_S3	Under this method, previously presented years financial positions and results would not be adjusted; however, certain disclosures are required to be presented for comparability to prior years results.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P78_S4	We plan to adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	Under the modified retrospective adoption method, we have elected to retroactively adjust only those contracts that do not meet the definition of a completed contract at the date of initial application.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	As a result, our initial adjustments to costs to obtain and costs to fulfill a contract may not be indicative of future capitalization amounts once the new revenue standard is effective.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P79_S2	In addition, upon adoption the deferred implementation revenue balance associated with past implementation costs will no longer be recognized over the client life and such balance, net of tax, will be adjusted and recorded to retained earnings.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P79_S3	We anticipate that the new revenue standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet upon adoption, resulting from the requirement to capitalize certain commissions and contract fulfillment costs, which we currently expense as incurred, and from the removal of substantially all of the deferred revenue balances associated with past implementation fees for which $55.1 million is recorded at December 31, 2017.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	Compared to our current accounting, we believe that the seasonality associated with the timing of when claims are submitted by our clients and when our clients receive payment on these claims will be reflected in our financial results with differing patterns.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P80_S1	In addition, there may be a significant impact on pre-tax operating income until the amortization expense associated with capitalized commissions and costs to fulfill begins to approximate amounts capitalized.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P81_S1	The most significant impact to our consolidated financial statements relates to the recognition and measurement of equity instruments, which are currently carried at cost, but will be measured at fair value with any unrecognized gains or losses being recorded in our consolidated statements of income.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P81_S2	We are evaluating the impact to our consolidated financial statements but expect that it could have a significant impact, including additional volatility in other income (expense) within our statement of income in future periods as a result of the measurement of equity securities upon observable price changes and impairments.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P81_S3	We expect to elect the measurement alternative for all equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which is defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted by observable price changes on a prospective basis.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P82_S1	We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2018 and the initial impact will be recognized in other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of income for the three months ending March 31, 2018.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for leases.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	The new guidance most significantly impacts lessee accounting and disclosures, but also requires enhanced disclosures for lessors.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	First, this guidance requires lessees to identify arrangements that should be accounted for as leases.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	Under this guidance, for lease arrangements exceeding a 12-month term, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation is recorded by the lessee for all leases, whether operating or financing, while the income statement reflects lease expense for operating leases and amortization and interest expense for financing leases.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P84_S2	Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P84_S3	In addition, the new lease guidance requires the use of the modified retrospective method.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P84_S4	This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P84_S5	Early adoption is permitted; however, we will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P84_S6	We anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as all long-term leases will be capitalized on the consolidated balance sheet.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Praxify On June 23, 2017, we acquired Praxify Technologies, Inc., or Praxify, a Palo Alto-based company focused on reinventing how doctors work with health data to drive productivity, portability, and improved decision support.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P85_S1	We acquired Praxify to advance our platform strategy and mobile capabilities to drive streamlined workflows and intelligence at and around the moments of care.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P85_S2	We anticipate that this acquisition will accelerate our research and development initiatives by adding significant expertise in mobile and user experience design.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P85_S3	Additionally, the underlying technology on which Praxify is built will be integrated into our platform, and we anticipate it will create new opportunities for both internal and third-party developers to rapidly build and launch applications.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	The purchase price of Praxify was $41.1 million , net of cash acquired.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	The purchase price excludes $16.5 million expected to be earned by key employees of Praxify based upon continued employment, which is accounted for as compensation expense and is being recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the requisite service period.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P86_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , there was $5.5 million of prepaid compensation expense related to retention bonuses made at the time of acquisition included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line and $8.0 million in the investments and other assets line on our consolidated balance sheet.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	The fair value of net assets acquired primarily consisted of purchased intangible assets of $15.7 million related to technology.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P87_S1	The $33.8 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P87_S2	We incurred transaction costs of $1.4 million associated with this acquisition.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	Patient IO On August 25, 2016, we acquired Filament Labs, Inc. (doing business as Patient IO), an Austin-based care coordination platform used by providers to engage patients and caregivers outside of the clinic.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	We acquired Patient IO to strengthen our ability to partner with providers as they deliver value-based care.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P88_S2	We anticipate this acquisition will accelerate our movement toward becoming a trusted resource and partner to the patient.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P88_S3	The purchase price of Patient IO was $15.2 million , net of cash acquired.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P88_S4	The purchase price excludes $9.6 million to be earned by key employees of Patient IO based upon continued employment, which is accounted for as compensation expense and will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the requisite service period.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P88_S5	The fair value of net assets acquired included purchased intangible assets of $5.3 million related to technology acquired and $0.6 million related to customer relationships.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P88_S6	The $10.7 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	On April 11, 2016, we acquired Arsenal Health, formerly known as Smart Scheduling, Inc., for $1.7 million .
1131096_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	We purchased Arsenal Health to add its schedule optimization functionality to our athenaCoordinator offering.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P89_S2	We expect this acquisition to accelerate our capabilities in machine learning and predictive analytics.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P89_S3	The fair value of the purchased intangible assets related to technology acquired was $0.9 million .
1131096_18_ITEM15_P89_S4	The $0.8 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the purchased intangible assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P89_S5	In conjunction with this acquisition, Smart Scheduling, Inc. settled the convertible note receivable and related interest from our More Disruption Please, or MDP, Accelerator Program, which represented a total fair value of $0.3 million .
1131096_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P90_S2	Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, and shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P90_S3	Under the treasury stock method, dilutive securities are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the periods and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P90_S4	Securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share; therefore, in periods of net loss, shares used to calculate basic and dilutive net loss per share are equivalent.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	The following table reconciles the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated:
1131096_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 0.4 million , 0.4 million , and 0.7 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , respectively, because their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their estimated fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	Money market funds are valued using a market approach based upon the quoted market prices of identical instruments when available or other observable inputs such as trading prices of identical instruments in inactive markets or similar securities.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	Our MDP Accelerator program is designed to cultivate heath care information technology start-ups and expand services offered to our provider network.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P95_S1	MDP Accelerator portfolio investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are typically made in the form of convertible notes receivable or cost method investments, which are included in investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	At December 31, 2017 , as there is no indication of performance risk, we estimate that the fair value of the notes receivable approximates cost based on inputs that include the original transaction prices, our own recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investments, subsequent rounds of financing, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P95_S3	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had $273.8 million and $292.5 million , respectively, outstanding on our term loan facility and we had not drawn on the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	The credit facility carries a variable interest rate set at current market rates, and as such, the carrying value approximates fair value.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	The following table presents information about our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques we utilized to determine such fair value.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P97_S1	In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities obtained from readily available pricing sources for similar instruments.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P97_S2	The fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable values which are supported by little or no market activity.
1131096_18_ITEM15_P97_S3	It is our policy to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period; however, there have been no such transfers during any of the periods presented.
