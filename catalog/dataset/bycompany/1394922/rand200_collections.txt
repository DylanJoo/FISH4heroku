1394922_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Associates 12, LLC (the Managing Member ), a Nevada limited liability corporation.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2010, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions, totaling $30.0 million (inclusive of the $500 initial member s capital investment) have been received and 2,999,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the limited liability company units (Units).
1394922_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company has acquired and intends to acquire various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and to make loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as materials handling equipment, manufacturing equipment, mining equipment, and transportation equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	A portion of the portfolio will include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P7_S3	The Company will also seek investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company only purchases equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease will be entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Through December 31, 2010, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of $22.0 million.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company had also loaned $3.0 million for notes receivable secured by various assets.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company s objective is to have at least 60% of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	High quality corporate credits are lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or are public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, will consist of real estate investments.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P10_S4	The Company s objective is to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	During 2010 and 2009, certain lessees generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments owned at any time during the reinvestment period; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30 million); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities are North America and Europe.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	Currently, 100% of the Company s operating revenues are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company has no full time employees.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company has acquired a diversified portfolio of equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	The equipment has been leased to lessees in various industries.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	The following tables set forth the types of equipment acquired by the Company through December 31, 2010 and the industries to which the assets have been leased (dollars in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	From inception to December 31, 2010, the Company has disposed of certain leased assets as set forth below (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	For further information regarding the Company s equipment lease portfolio as of December 31, 2010, see Note 6 to the financial statements, Investments in equipment and leases, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company finances assets in diverse industries.
1394922_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	The following tables set forth the types of assets financed by the Company through December 31, 2010 and the industries to which the assets have been financed (dollars in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	From inception to December 31, 2010, assets financed by the Company that are associated with terminated loans are as follows (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	For further information regarding the Company s note receivable portfolio as of December 31, 2010, see Note 4 to the financial statements, Notes receivable, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company does not own or lease any real property, plant or material physical properties other than the equipment held for lease as set forth in Item 1, Business.
1394922_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2010, a total of 893 investors were Unitholders of record in the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	As noted above, there is no public market for Units and, in order to preserve the Company s status for federal income tax purposes, the Company will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	Nevertheless, in order to provide an estimated per Unit value for those Unitholders who seek valuation information, the Manager has calculated an estimated value per Unit as of December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Manager estimates the Company s per Unit value by first estimating the aggregate net asset value of the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	The valuation does not take into account any future business activity of the Company; rather it is a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as any current assets and liabilities, as well as for any investment in securities, were assumed to equal their reported balances, which management believes approximate their fair values, as adjusted for impairment.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	The same was applied to loans incurred under the acquisition facility since they bear variable rates of interest.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	A discounted cash flow approach was used to estimate the values of notes receivable, investments in leases, non-recourse debt and interest rate swaps.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	Under such approach, the value of a financial instrument was estimated by calculating the present value of the instrument s expected cash flows.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P6_S2	The present value was determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by discount rates as deemed appropriate by the Manager.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P6_S3	In most cases, the discount rates used were based on U.S. Treasury yields reported as of the reporting date, plus a spread to account for the credit risk difference between the instrument being valued and Treasury securities.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	After calculating the aggregate estimated net asset value of the Company, the Manager then calculated the portion of the aggregate estimated value that would be distributed to Unitholders on liquidation of the Company, and divided the total that would be so distributable by the number of outstanding Units as of the December 31, 2010 valuation date.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the value of the Company s assets, calculated on this basis, was approximately $10.00 per Unit.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	The foregoing valuation was performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated liquidation value per Unit for those Unitholders who seek valuation information.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P8_S1	It is important to note again that there is no market for the Units, and, accordingly, this value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unitholder would receive if he were to seek to sell his Units.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	The Company will liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and investment cycle.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P9_S1	Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to when the Company will be fully liquidated, the amount the Company may actually receive if and when it seeks to liquidate its assets, the amount of lease payments and equipment disposition proceeds the Company will actually receive over the remaining term of the Company, or the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unitholders over the course of the Company s remaining term.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	The Managing Member has sole discretion in determining the amount of distributions; provided, however, that the Managing Member will not cause the Company to reinvest operating revenues in equipment, but will distribute available cash, subject to payment of any obligations of the Company, (i) in an amount sufficient to allow an investor in a 31% federal income tax bracket to meet the federal and state income taxes due on income from the operations of the Fund; (ii) through the first full fiscal quarter ending at least six months after termination of the offering of Units, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) a rate of return on their original capital contribution equal to 2.5% over the average yield on five-year United States Treasury Bonds for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of distribution, as published in a national financial newspaper from time to time (with a minimum of 8% per annum and a maximum of 9% per annum), or (b) 90% of the total amount of cash available for distributions; and (iii) for each quarter during the rest of the reinvestment period, an amount equal to 9% per annum on their original capital contribution.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P12_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions in February 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P12_S1	The rate for monthly distributions from 2010 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P12_S2	Likewise the rate for monthly distributions from 2009 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P12_S3	The rate for each of the quarterly distributions paid in 2010 and 2009 was $0.225 per Unit.
1394922_11_ITEM5_P13_S0	The following table presents summarized information regarding distributions to Other Members:
1394922_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	A smaller reporting company is not required to present selected financial data in accordance with item 301(c) of Regulation S-K.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Statements contained in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, the economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) is a California limited liability company that was formed in January 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ), primarily in the United States.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	As of September 25, 2009, the offering was terminated.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	On January 29, 2008, the Fund made its first investment in a long-term operating lease.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company has purchased a total of $22.0 million of equipment for long-term operating and direct financing leases and funded investments in notes receivable totaling $3.0 million.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Subsequently, during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company will reinvest cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the Other Members and/or utilize its credit facilities to acquire additional equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ends December 31, 2015, the Company anticipates continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement ( Operating Agreement ), as amended.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were concentrations (greater than 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financial borrowers in certain industries as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	During 2010 and 2009, certain lessees generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods due to anticipated changes in the mix of investments and/or lessees as a result of normal business activities.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment; as such, utilization rates may tend to decrease during the liquidation stage of the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	All of the Company s leased property was acquired during the period from 2008 to 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 99% and 100% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company had net losses of $1.1 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Results for 2010 reflect year over year increases in both total revenues and total operating expenses when compared to the prior year.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Total revenues for 2010 increased by $609 thousand compared to the prior year.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was primarily due to higher operating lease revenues partially offset by a decline in interest income on the Company s notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Operating lease revenues increased by $627 thousand primarily due to revenues derived from lease assets acquired since July 2009 totaling $9.0 million.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Interest income on notes receivable decreased by $29 thousand as revenues lost from certain notes receivable placed on non-accrual status more than offset revenues derived from new investments funded since December 2009, combined with continued run-off of the notes receivable portfolio.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	During 2010 and 2009, revenues derived from the Company s investments in lease assets and notes receivable approximated 99.5% and 99.7% of total revenues, respectively.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	During the respective years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $19 thousand and $10 thousand of the Company s total revenues were derived from processing and servicing fees on certain lease transactions.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Total expenses during 2010 were higher by $478 thousand as compared to the prior year.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The net increase in expenses was primarily a result of higher depreciation expense, an impairment loss recognized on an equity investment, and increases in costs reimbursed to the Managing Member and affiliates, outside services and professional fees, other expense and management fees paid to the Managing Member offset, in part, by lower acquisition expense and provision for credit losses.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in depreciation expense totaled $449 thousand and was mainly due to the year over year increase in the Company s lease asset portfolio.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The impairment loss recognized on an equity investment totaled $356 thousand and was attributable to an approximate 79% reduction in valuation as determined by investee cash burn and potential for additional venture investors.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Moreover, costs reimbursed to the Managing Member and certain affiliates increased by $197 thousand as a result of higher administrative costs related to expanded operations.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Outside services and professional fees expense increased by a combined $119 thousand primarily due to higher audit related fees and business development expense, as well as expenses incurred relative to a lessee bankruptcy which had been fully reserved in prior quarters.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The increase in audit related fees was primarily due to increased operations activity and the incremental cost of regulatory compliance.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	Other expense increased by $42 thousand as a result of higher postage and printing costs related to investor communications as well as higher bank charges, and insurance costs; and, asset management fees paid to the Managing Member increased by $32 thousand as a result of a higher number of managed assets and related rents.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases in expenses were decreases in acquisition expense and the provision for credit losses.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Acquisition costs decreased by $486 thousand due to the decline in acquisition phase activity subsequent to the completion of the Company s initial acquisition stage during 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Such decline was primarily the result of an absence of suitable investments and the continuing effects of the economic downturn.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	The provision for credit losses decreased by $268 thousand as a result of a smaller amount of reserve recorded in 2010 relative to a fully reserved impaired note receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	A majority of the impairment reserve on such impaired note receivable was recorded in 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	During the funding period, which ended on September 25, 2009, the Company s primary source of liquidity was subscription proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	Through September 30, 2009, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions, totaling $30.0 million have been received.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Subsequent to that date, the primary source of liquidity for the Company has been its cash flow from fixed-term leasing activities.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	As the lease terms expire, the Company will re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	The future liquidity beyond the contractual minimum rentals will depend on the Company s success in remarketing or selling the equipment as it comes off rental.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Throughout the Reinvestment Period (as defined in the Operating Agreement), the Company anticipates reinvesting a portion of lease payments from assets owned, and/or payments received on notes receivable, in new leasing or financing transactions.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Such reinvestment will occur only after the payment of all obligations, including debt service (both principal and interest), the payment of management fees to the Manager and providing for cash distributions to the Members.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	In a normal economy, if inflation in the general economy becomes significant, it may affect the Company in as much as the residual (resale) values and rates on re-leases of the Company s leased assets may increase as the costs of similar assets increase.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	However, the Company s revenues from existing leases and notes would not increase as such rates are generally fixed for the terms of the leases and notes without adjustment for inflation.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	In addition, if interest rates increase significantly under such circumstances, the rates that the Company can obtain on future lease or financing transactions will be expected to increase as the cost of capital is a significant factor in the pricing of leases and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	Leases and notes already in place, for the most part, would not be affected by changes in interest rates.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Cash provided by operating activities during 2010 increased by $1.5 million, or 76%, as compared to the prior year.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The net increase in cash flow was mainly attributable to the year over year increase in liabilities, a smaller net loss in 2010 as compared to 2009, and increased collections of accounts receivable offset, in part, by a decline in unearned rents.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Cash used in investing activities for 2010 decreased by $5.9 million, or 53%, when compared to the prior year.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The net increase in cash flow was primarily a result of a year over year reduction in cash used to purchase lease assets and a decrease in payments of initial direct costs offset, in part, by an increase in cash used to fund investments in notes receivable and a decrease in payments received on the notes.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Cash used to purchase lease assets declined by $6.7 million as the Company completed its initial acquisition stage during the second half of 2009 with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Payments of initial direct costs were lower by $169 thousand as a result of the decline in asset acquisitions.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases in cash flow was a $1.0 million year over year increase in cash used to fund investments in notes receivable; and, a $200 thousand decline in payments received on the notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease primarily reflects the impact of certain notes receivable being placed in non-accrual status.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities during 2010 declined by $8.5 million, or 77%, as compared to the prior year.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The net decrease in cash flow was primarily a result of the absence of subscription proceeds during 2010 coupled with an increase in distributions paid to Other Members offset, in part, by an increase in net borrowings, the settlement of an amount due from an affiliate during the first quarter of 2010, and a year over year decrease in syndication costs.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Subscription proceeds declined by $14.8 million as the Fund terminated the offering of its Units in September 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Distributions paid to Other Members increased by $729 thousand as a result of the year over year increase in Units issued and outstanding.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net borrowings increased by $3.7 million as the Company anticipated the funding of new loans and equipment leases.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	The payment received from an affiliate, which increased cash flow by $1.7 million, relates to a December 31, 2009 reassignment of a newly purchased lease asset; and the decline in syndication costs also improved cash flow by $1.6 million and was pursuant to the termination of the offering.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company participates with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility (the Acquisition Facility ) and a warehouse facility (the Warehouse Facility ) to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate, with a syndicate of financial institutions.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Credit Facility includes certain financial and non-financial covenants applicable to each borrower, including the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Such covenants include covenants typically found in credit facilities of the size and nature of the Credit Facility, such as accuracy of representations, good standing, absence of liens and material litigation, etc.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	The Company considers certain financial covenants to be material to its ongoing use of the Credit Facility and these covenants are described below.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain a specific tangible net worth, to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and to comply with other terms expressed in the Credit Facility, including limitation on the incurrence of additional debt and guaranties, defaults, and delinquencies.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	The material financial covenants are summarized as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Collateral value under the Warehouse Facility must exceed outstanding borrowings under that facility.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	EBITDA to Interest Ratio: Not to be less than 2 to 1 for the four fiscal quarters just ended.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	EBITDA is defined under the Credit Facility as, for the relevant period of time (1) gross revenues (all payments from leases and notes receivable) for such period minus (2) expenses deducted in determining net income for such period plus (3) to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period (a) provision for income taxes and (b) interest expense, and (c) depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Extraordinary items and gains or losses on (and proceeds from) sales or dispositions of assets outside of the ordinary course of business are excluded in the calculation of EBITDA.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Tangible Net Worth is defined as, as of the date of determination, (i) the net worth of the Company, after deducting therefrom (without duplication of deductions) the net book amount of all assets of the Company, after deducting any reserves and other amounts for assets which would be treated as intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and after certain other adjustments permitted under the agreements.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	The financial covenants referred to above are applicable to the Company only to the extent that the Company has borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company s Tangible Net Worth requirement under the Credit Facility was $7.5 million, the permitted maximum leverage ratio was 1.25 to 1, and the required minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) was 2 to 1.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	The Company was in compliance with each of these financial covenants with a minimum Tangible Net Worth, leverage ratio and (EBITDA) interest coverage ratio, as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement of $16.9 million, 0.22 to 1, and 33.58 to 1, respectively, as of December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P43_S3	As such, as of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all such material financial covenants.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	For purposes of compliance with the Credit Facility covenants, the Company uses a financial calculation of EBITDA, as defined therein, which is a non-GAAP financial performance measure.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	The EBITDA is utilized by the Company to calculate its debt covenant ratios.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The terms of the Credit Facility include standard events of default by the Company which, if not cured within applicable grace periods, could give lenders remedies against the Company, including the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings and a demand for repayment in advance of their stated maturity.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	If a breach of any material term of the Credit Facility should occur, the lenders may, at their option, increase borrowing rates, accelerate the obligations in advance of their stated maturities, terminate the facility, and exercise rights of collection available to them under the express terms of the facility, or by operation of law.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	The lenders also retain the discretion to waive a violation of any covenant at the Company s request.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company is currently in compliance with its obligations under the Credit Facility.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	In the event of a technical default (e.g., the failure to timely file a required report, or a one-time breach of a financial covenant), the Company believes it has ample time to request and be granted a waiver by the lenders, or, alternatively, cure the default under the existing provisions of its debt agreements, including, if necessary, arranging for additional capital from alternate sources to satisfy outstanding obligations.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The lending syndicate providing the Credit Facility has a blanket lien on all of the Company s assets as collateral for any and all borrowings under the Acquisition Facility, and on a pro-rata basis under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Acquisition Facility is generally recourse solely to the Company, and is not cross-defaulted to any other obligations of affiliated companies under the Credit Facility, except as described in this paragraph.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The Credit Facility is cross-defaulted to a default in the payment of any debt (other than non-recourse debt) or any other agreement or condition beyond the period of grace (not exceeding 30 days), the effect of which would entitle the lender under such agreement to accelerate the obligations prior to their stated maturity in an individual or aggregate principal amount in excess of 15% of the Company s consolidated Tangible Net Worth.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	Also, a bankruptcy of AFS will trigger a default for the Company under the Credit Facility.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling $3.7 million.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	The notes are secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	For detailed information on the Company s debt obligations, see Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions, based on cash flows from operations, beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had commitments to purchase lease assets totaling approximately $2.1 million and to fund investments in notes receivable approximately $1.8 million (see Note 11, Commitments, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).
1394922_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the financial statements, Summary of significant accounting policies, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management of the Company to be critical to an understanding of the Company s financial statements because their application requires significantly complex or subjective judgments, decisions, or assessments, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The Company also states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probably that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P67_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P67_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual contract term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P70_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the assets and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	See the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements attached hereto at pages 16 through 38.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ATEL 12, LLC (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of operations, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Management of the Company s Managing Member.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1394922_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ATEL 12, LLC as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Associates 12, LLC (the Managing Member ), a Nevada limited liability corporation.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P9_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	As of December 31, 2010, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions, totaling $30.0 million (inclusive of the $500 initial member s capital investment) have been received and 2,999,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the limited liability company units (Units).
1394922_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of operations, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P13_S2	These reclassifications had no effect on equity or net income.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after December 31, 2010, up until the issuance of the financial statements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	No events were noted which would require disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowances for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, operating and direct financing lease receivables, notes receivable and accounts receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company places the majority of its cash deposits and temporary cash investments in U.S. Treasury denominated instruments with the remainder placed in financial institutions with no less than $10 billion in assets, so as to meet ongoing working capital requirements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	The concentration of such deposits and temporary cash investments is not deemed to create a significant risk to the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Accounts and notes receivable represent amounts due from lessees or borrowers in various industries, related to equipment on operating leases or notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P24_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P24_S3	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P26_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P26_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P31_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P31_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P33_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probably that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P34_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P34_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P34_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P35_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual lease term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P36_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P36_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection and acquisition of equipment which are reimbursable to the Managing Member under the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	As the costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P39_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P39_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in the United States.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company s principal decision makers are the Managing Member s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company believes that its equipment leasing business operates as one reportable segment because: a) the Company measures profit and loss at the equipment portfolio level as a whole; b) the principal decision makers do not review information based on any operating segment other than the equipment leasing transaction portfolio; c) the Company does not maintain discrete financial information on any specific segment other than its equipment financing operations; d) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around different products and services other than equipment lease financing; and e) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around geographic areas.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company sought leasing opportunities were North America and Europe.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	Currently, 100% of the Company s operating revenues and long-lived assets are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company deemed an investment security to be impaired and recorded a fair value adjustment of approximately $356 thousand which reduced the cost basis of the investment.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	There were no impaired securities at December 31, 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	From time to time, the Company receives warrants to purchase securities of its borrowers in connection with lending arrangements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	During the first quarter of 2008, the Company commenced funding of investments in notes receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	Pursuant to the terms of certain of these investments, the Company received equity rights in the form of warrants.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P48_S3	Such warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried at an estimated fair value on the balance sheet at the end of the period, as determined by the Managing Member.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P48_S4	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Managing Member estimated the fair value of the warrants to be nominal in amount.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	Pursuant to the provisions of Section 701 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is not subject to federal income taxes.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided current franchise income taxes for only those states which levy income taxes on partnerships.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the related provision for state income taxes was approximately $10 thousand and $14 thousand, respectively.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P49_S4	The Company does not have any entity level uncertain tax positions.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions and is generally subject to examination by U.S. federal (or state and local) income tax authorities for three years from the filing of a tax return.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	The tax bases of the Company s net assets and liabilities vary from the amounts presented in these financial statements at December 31, 2010 and 2009 as follows (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	The primary differences between the tax bases of net assets and the amounts recorded in the financial statements are the result of differences in accounting for impairment losses, syndication costs and differences between the depreciation methods used in the financial statements and the Company s tax returns.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	The following reconciles the net loss reported in these financial statements to the loss reported on the Company s federal tax return (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Net loss and distributions per Unit are based upon the weighted average number of Other Members Units outstanding during the year.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	No. 2011-01, Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. 2010-20.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	ASU 2011-01 temporarily delays the effective date of the disclosures about troubled debt restructurings in Update 2010-20 for public entities.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	The delay is intended to allow the Board time to complete its deliberations on what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	The effective date of the new disclosures about troubled debt restructurings for public entities and the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring will then be coordinated.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P56_S4	Currently, that guidance is anticipated to be effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2011.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P56_S5	The Company anticipates that adoption of these additional disclosures will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	ASU 2010-20 requires entities to provide disclosures designed to facilitate financial statement users evaluation of (i) the nature of credit risk inherent in the entity s portfolio of financing receivables, (ii) how that risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses and (iii) the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	Disclosures must be disaggregated by portfolio segment, the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses, and class of financing receivable, which is generally a disaggregation of portfolio segment.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P57_S3	The required disclosures include, among other things, a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses as well as information about modified, impaired, non-accrual and past due loans and credit quality indicators.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P57_S4	ASU 2010-20 is effective as of December 31, 2010, as it relates to disclosures required as of the end of a reporting period.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P57_S5	Disclosures that relate to activity during a reporting period will be required for the Company s financial statements that include periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P57_S6	The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations; however, it did add additional disclosures which have been included in Notes 2 and 5.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, Improving Disclosure about Fair Value Measurement.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	ASU 2010-06 requires additional disclosures related to recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements, and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in a rollforward reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	Except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, the guidance became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010 and was adopted during the first quarter of 2010 with no impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	Concentration of credit risk and major customers:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company leases equipment to lessees and provides debt financing to borrowers in diversified industries.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Leases and notes receivable are subject to the Managing Member s credit committee review.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	The leases and notes receivable provide for the return of the equipment to the Company upon default.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were concentrations (greater than 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financial borrowers in certain industries as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Concentration of credit risk and major customers (continued):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	During 2010 and 2009, certain lessees generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company has various notes receivable from borrowers who have financed the purchase of equipment through the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	At December 31, 2010, the original terms of the notes receivable are between 17 and 42 months and bear interest at rates ranging from 11% to 18%.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P64_S2	The notes are generally secured by the equipment financed.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P64_S3	The notes mature from 2011 through 2014.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P64_S4	At December 31, 2009, the Company had a $375 thousand reserve related to an impaired note receivable.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P64_S5	During 2010, an additional impairment provision totaling $125 thousand was recorded related to the same note receivable which reduced the net book value of such investment to zero.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	In addition to the fully reserved note, there were three other notes in non-accrual status as of December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	Such notes were considered impaired relative to their payment terms.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P103_S2	The Managing Member believes that the costs reimbursed are the lower of (i) actual costs incurred on behalf of the Company or (ii) the amount the Company would be required to pay independent parties for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	The limitation on the amount of syndication costs pursuant to the Operating Agreement is determined on the date of termination of the offering.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P109_S1	The notes are due in monthly installments.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	The debt is secured by liens granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P110_S2	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P110_S3	The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or liability of the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P110_S4	Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lenders, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties' signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company's good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P110_S5	Accordingly, as there are no financial covenants or ratios imposed on the Company in connection with the non-recourse debt, the Company has determined that there are no material covenants with respect to the non-recourse debt that warrant footnote disclosure.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, borrowings under the facility were as follows (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company and its affiliates pay an annual commitment fee to have access to this line of credit.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P114_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate amount remaining unutilized under the Credit Facility is potentially available to the Company, subject to certain sub-facility and borrowing-base limitations.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P114_S2	However, as amounts are drawn on the Credit Facility by each of the Company and the affiliates who are borrowers under the Credit Facility, the amount remaining available to all borrowers to draw under the Credit Facility is reduced.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P114_S3	As the Warehousing Facility is a short term bridge facility, any amounts borrowed under the Warehousing Facility, and then repaid by the affiliated borrowers (including the Company) upon allocation of an acquisition to a specific purchaser, become available under the Warehouse Facility for further short term borrowing.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company s Tangible Net Worth requirement under the Credit Facility was $7.5 million, the permitted maximum leverage ratio was not to exceed 1.25 to 1, and the required minimum interest coverage ratio was not to be less than 2 to 1.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P115_S3	The Company does not anticipate any covenant violations nor does it anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict its operations or its ability to procure additional financing.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	The interest rate on the Credit Facility is based on either the LIBOR/Eurocurrency rate of 1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month maturity plus a lender designated spread, or the bank s Prime rate, which re-prices daily.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	Principal amounts of loans made under the Credit Facility that are prepaid may be re-borrowed on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth under the Credit Facility.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	The Warehousing Trust is used by the Warehouse Facility borrowers to acquire and hold, on a short-term basis, certain lease transactions that meet the investment objectives of each of such entities.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P118_S2	Each of the leasing programs sponsored by AFS and ALC currently in its acquisition stage is a pro rata participant in the Warehousing Trust, as described below.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P118_S3	When a program no longer has a need for short term financing provided by the Warehousing Facility, it is removed from participation, and as new leasing investment entities are formed by AFS and ALC and commence their acquisition stages, these new entities are added.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the investment program participants were ATEL Capital Equipment Fund X, LLC, ATEL Capital Equipment Fund XI, LLC, and the Company.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	Pursuant to the Warehousing Trust, the benefit of the lease transaction assets, and the corresponding liabilities under the Warehouse Facility, inure to each of such entities based upon each entity s pro-rata share in the Warehousing Trust estate.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P120_S1	The pro-rata share is calculated as a ratio of the net worth of each entity over the aggregate net worth of all entities benefiting from the Warehousing Trust estate, excepting that the trustees, AFS and ALC, are both jointly and severally liable for the pro rata portion of the obligations of each of the affiliated partnerships and limited liability companies participating under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P120_S2	Transactions are financed through this Warehouse Facility only until the transactions are allocated to a specific program for purchase or are otherwise disposed by AFS and ALC.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P120_S3	When a determination is made to allocate the transaction to a specific program for purchase by the program, the purchaser repays the debt associated with the asset, either with cash or by means of proceeds of a draw under the Acquisition Facility, and the asset is removed from the Warehouse Facility collateral, and ownership of the asset and any debt obligation associated with the asset are assumed solely by the purchasing entity.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	As of December 31, 2010, borrowings of $4.8 million were outstanding under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P121_S1	The Company s maximum contingent obligation on the outstanding warehouse balance at December 31, 2010 was approximately $1.1 million.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	The Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P123_S1	The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P123_S2	However, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Managing Member knows of no facts or circumstances that would make the Company s contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial transactions between businesses.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P124_S1	Accordingly, the Company believes that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice, and that any potential liability under the Company s similar commitments is remote.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P124_S2	Should any such indemnification obligation become payable, the Company would separately record and/or disclose such liability in accordance with GAAP.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	A total of 2,999,482 Units were issued and outstanding at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Company is otherwise permitted, but not required, to repurchase Units upon a holder s request.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	The repurchase of Fund Units is made in accordance with Section 13 of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P126_S3	The repurchase would be at the discretion of the Manager on terms it determines to be appropriate under given circumstances, in the event that the Manager deems such repurchase to be in the best interest of the Company; provided, the Company is never required to repurchase any Units.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P126_S4	Upon the repurchase of any Units by the Fund, the tendered Units are cancelled.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	Units repurchased in prior periods were repurchased at amounts representing the original investment less cumulative distributions made to the Unitholder with respect to the Units.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	All Units repurchased during a quarter are deemed to be repurchased effective the last day of the preceding quarter, and are not deemed to be outstanding during, or entitled to allocations of net income, net loss or distributions for the quarter in which such repurchase occurs.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	The Fund s net income or net losses are to be allocated 100% to the Members.

1394922_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P130_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P134_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no assets or liabilities that require measurement at fair value on a recurring basis.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P135_S1	However, at December 31, 2010, the Company measured an impaired investment security at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P135_S2	Such estimate of measurement methodology is as follows:
1394922_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P136_S1	The investment securities are adjusted for impairment, if any, based upon factors which include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P136_S2	At December 31, 2010, the Company deemed an investment security to be impaired and recorded a fair value adjustment of approximately $356 thousand which reduced the cost basis of the investment.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P136_S3	The non-recurring fair value adjustment was based on an approximate 79% reduction in valuation as determined by investee cash burn and potential for additional venture investors.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the impaired investment security is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy due to the significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P137_S1	There were no impaired investment securities at December 31, 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	The following table presents the fair value measurement of the impaired investment security measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P139_S1	Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P140_S1	Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P140_S2	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or has realized in a current market exchange.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P140_S3	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	The recorded amounts of due from (due to) affiliates approximate fair value because of the short-term period of settlement.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market rates for similar types of lending arrangements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P145_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based upon the current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	The fair value estimates presented herein were based on pertinent information available to the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P148_S1	Although the Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.
1394922_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	The following table presents estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company s Managing Member s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer ( Management ), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

1394922_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Management of the Managing Member is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) for the Company, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The internal control process of the Managing Member, as it is applicable to the Company, was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management of the Managing Member assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, as of December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Based on its assessment, Management of the Managing Member concluded that the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, was effective as of December 31, 2010.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which exempts non-accelerated filers from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
1394922_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.

1394922_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates.

1394922_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	The Company paid selling commissions in the amount of 9% of Gross Proceeds, as defined, to ATEL Securities Corporation, an affiliate of the Manager.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	During 2010, the Company did not incur any additional selling commissions.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P3_S1	Through December 31, 2009, $2.7 million of such commissions had either been accrued or paid to ASC.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P3_S2	Of that amount, $2.3 million has been re-allowed to other broker/dealers.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Company pays the Manager an Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4% of Operating Revenues, which includes Gross Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P4_S1	The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P4_S2	The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5% of all Company Distributions.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P7_S0	AFS supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees/borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P7_S1	AFS intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P8_S1	While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor's understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states' merit review guidelines.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P8_S2	The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P9_S0	The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. ("NASAA") is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P9_S1	NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the "NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines").
1394922_11_ITEM11_P9_S2	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P9_S3	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P9_S4	The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund's prospectus (the "NASAA Fee Limitation").
1394922_11_ITEM11_P9_S5	Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund's term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager's Carried Interest, as described below.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P10_S1	To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P10_S2	To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P10_S3	Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund's equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P11_S3	[50% x .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund's minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_11_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P13_S0	With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5% + 5% = 11.5%), and 7.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5% + 1% = 7.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P13_S1	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P14_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager's Carried Interest.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P14_S1	If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager's Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P14_S2	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P14_S3	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
1394922_11_ITEM11_P15_S0	See Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.
1394922_11_ITEM12_P0_S0	At December 31, 2010, no investor is known to hold beneficially more than 5% of the issued and outstanding Units.

1394922_11_ITEM15_P6_S2	To this end, this Code of Ethics serves to (1) emphasize the Company s commitment to ethics and compliance with the law; (2) set forth basic standards of ethical and legal behavior; (3) provide reporting mechanisms for known or suspected ethical or legal violations; and (4) help prevent and detect wrongdoing.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P6_S3	This Code of Ethics is intended to augment and supplement the standard of ethics and business conduct expected of all Company employees, and its limitation to Covered Officers is not intended to limit the obligation of all Company employees to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity in all transactions and interactions conducted while in the Company s employ.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the course of business of the Company, this Code of Ethics serves only as a rough guide.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	Confronted with ethically ambiguous situations, the Covered Officers should remember the Company s commitment to the highest ethical standards and seek independent advice, where necessary, to ensure that all actions they take on behalf of the Company honor this commitment.

1394922_11_ITEM15_P8_S2	They shall not misrepresent facts or engage in illegal, unethical, or anti-competitive practices for personal or professional gain.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	This fundamental standard of honest and ethical conduct extends to the handling of conflicts of interest.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	The Covered Officers shall avoid any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company, and any personal activities, investments, or associations that might give rise to such conflicts.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P9_S2	They shall not compete with or use the Company, for personal gain, self-deal, or take advantage of any corporate opportunities.

1394922_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood, as fully disclosed in the offering documents for the Company, that AA12 as managing member of the Company has certain inherent conflicts of interest.

1394922_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	The Covered Officers shall provide thorough and accurate financial and accounting data for inclusion in such disclosures.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P11_S2	The Covered Officers shall not knowingly conceal or falsify information, misrepresent material facts, or omit material facts necessary to avoid misleading the Company s independent public auditors or investors.

1394922_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	If the Covered Officer is unsure whether a particular action would violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation, he or she should seek the advice of inside counsel (if available), and, where necessary, outside counsel before undertaking it.
1394922_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Covered Officers will promptly bring to the attention of the Company s General Counsel or the Board of Directors any information concerning a material violation of any of the laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company and the operation of its businesses, by the Company or any agent thereof, or of violation of this Code of Ethics.

1394922_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Associates 12, LLC (the Managing Member ), a Nevada limited liability company.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2011, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, totaling $30.0 million (inclusive of the $500 initial member s capital investment) have been received and 2,993,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the limited liability company units (Units).
1394922_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company has acquired and intends to acquire various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and to make loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as materials handling equipment, manufacturing equipment, mining equipment, and transportation equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	A portion of the portfolio will include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	The Company will also seek investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company only purchases equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease will be entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Through December 31, 2011, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of $25.1 million.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company had also loaned $3.0 million for notes receivable secured by various assets.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company s objective is to have at least 60% of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	High quality corporate credits are lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or are public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, will consist of real estate investments.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P10_S4	The Company s objective is to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	During 2011 and 2010, certain lessees generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues as follows:
1394922_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments owned at any time during the reinvestment period; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30 million); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities are North America and Europe.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Currently, 100% of the Company s operating revenues are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company has no full time employees.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company has acquired a diversified portfolio of equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	The equipment has been leased to lessees in various industries.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	The following tables set forth the types of equipment acquired by the Company through December 31, 2011 and the industries to which the assets have been leased (dollars in thousands):
1394922_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	From inception to December 31, 2011, the Company has disposed of certain leased assets as set forth below (in thousands):
1394922_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	For further information regarding the Company s equipment lease portfolio as of December 31, 2011, see Note 6 to the financial statements, Investments in equipment and leases, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company finances assets in diverse industries.
1394922_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	The following tables set forth the types of assets financed by the Company through December 31, 2011 and the industries to which the assets have been financed (dollars in thousands):
1394922_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	From inception to December 31, 2011, assets financed by the Company that are associated with terminated loans are as follows (in thousands):
1394922_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	For further information regarding the Company s note receivable portfolio as of December 31, 2011, see Note 4 to the financial statements, Notes receivable, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company does not own or lease any real property, plant or material physical properties other than the equipment held for lease as set forth in Item 1, Business.
1394922_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2011, a total of 898 investors were Unitholders of record in the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As noted above, there is no public market for Units and, in order to preserve the Company s status for federal income tax purposes, the Company will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	Nevertheless, in order to provide an estimated per Unit value for those Unitholders who seek valuation information, the Manager has calculated an estimated value per Unit as of December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Manager estimates the Company s per Unit value by first estimating the aggregate net asset value of the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	The valuation does not take into account any future business activity of the Company; rather it is a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as any current assets and liabilities, as well as for any investment in securities, were assumed to equal their reported balances, which management believes approximate their fair values, as adjusted for impairment.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	The same was applied to loans incurred under the acquisition facility since they bear variable rates of interest.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	A discounted cash flow approach was used to estimate the values of notes receivable, investments in leases, non-recourse debt and interest rate swaps.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P6_S1	Under such approach, the value of a financial instrument was estimated by calculating the present value of the instrument s expected cash flows.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P6_S2	The present value was determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by discount rates as deemed appropriate by the Manager.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P6_S3	In most cases, the discount rates used were based on U.S. Treasury yields reported as of the reporting date, plus a spread to account for the credit risk difference between the instrument being valued and Treasury securities.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	After calculating the aggregate estimated net asset value of the Company, the Manager then calculated the portion of the aggregate estimated value that would be distributed to Unitholders on liquidation of the Company, and divided the total that would be so distributable by the number of outstanding Units as of the December 31, 2011 valuation date.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the value of the Company s assets, calculated on this basis, was approximately $8.73 per Unit.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	The foregoing valuation was performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated liquidation value per Unit for those Unitholders who seek valuation information.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P8_S1	It is important to note again that there is no market for the Units, and, accordingly, this value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unitholder would receive if he were to seek to sell his Units.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	The Company will liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and investment cycle.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P9_S1	Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to when the Company will be fully liquidated, the amount the Company may actually receive if and when it seeks to liquidate its assets, the amount of lease payments and equipment disposition proceeds the Company will actually receive over the remaining term of the Company, or the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unitholders over the course of the Company s remaining term.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P10_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P11_S0	The Managing Member has sole discretion in determining the amount of distributions; provided, however, that the Managing Member will not cause the Company to reinvest operating revenues in equipment, but will distribute available cash, subject to payment of any obligations of the Company, (i) in an amount sufficient to allow an investor in a 31% federal income tax bracket to meet the federal and state income taxes due on income from the operations of the Fund; (ii) through the first full fiscal quarter ending at least six months after termination of the offering of Units, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) a rate of return on their original capital contribution equal to 2.5% over the average yield on five-year United States Treasury Bonds for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of distribution, as published in a national financial newspaper from time to time (with a minimum of 8% per annum and a maximum of 9% per annum), or (b) 90% of the total amount of cash available for distributions; and (iii) for each quarter during the rest of the reinvestment period, an amount equal to 9% per annum on their original capital contribution.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P12_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions in February 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P12_S1	The rate for monthly distributions from 2011 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P12_S2	Likewise the rate for monthly distributions from 2010 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2010.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P12_S3	The rate for each of the quarterly distributions paid in 2011 and 2010 was $0.225 per Unit.
1394922_12_ITEM5_P13_S0	The following table presents summarized information regarding distributions to Other Members:
1394922_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	A smaller reporting company is not required to present selected financial data in accordance with item 301(c) of Regulation S-K.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Statements contained in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, the economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K.

1394922_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) is a California limited liability company that was formed in January 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ), primarily in the United States.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	As of September 25, 2009, the offering was terminated.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	On January 29, 2008, the Fund made its first investment in a long-term operating lease.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company has purchased a total of $25.1 million of equipment for long-term operating and direct financing leases and funded investments in notes receivable totaling $3.0 million.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Subsequently, during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company will reinvest cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the Other Members and/or utilize its credit facilities to acquire additional equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ends December 31, 2015, the Company anticipates continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement ( Operating Agreement ), as amended.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were concentrations (greater than 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financial borrowers in certain industries as follows:
1394922_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	As previously mentioned, certain lessees generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues during 2011 and 2010 as follows:
1394922_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods due to anticipated changes in the mix of investments and/or lessees as a result of normal business activities.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment; as such, utilization rates may tend to decrease during the liquidation stage of the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	All of the Company s leased property was acquired during the period from 2008 to 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 100% and 99% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company had net income of $174 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to a net loss of $1.1 million for the prior year.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Results for 2011 reflect an increase in total revenues and a decrease in total operating expenses.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Total revenues for 2011 increased by $1.1 million compared to the prior year.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was primarily due to higher lease revenues from both operating and direct financing leases and an increase in other income.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Operating lease revenues increased by $818 thousand primarily due to income derived from $3.2 million of lease assets acquired during the current year and the incremental revenues derived from the twelve month deployment of $4.5 million of lease assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2010.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Direct financing lease revenues increased by $136 thousand as certain equipment under operating leases were re-leased as direct financing leases during 2011; and, other income increased by $41 thousand primarily due to amounts received from a trustee pursuant to the liquidation of assets held by a delinquent borrower.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Total expenses for 2011 were lower by $242 thousand as compared to the prior year.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	The net decline in expenses was primarily a result of lower provision for losses on investment in securities, reduced provision for credit losses, and decreases in outside services and acquisition expenses offset, in part, by increases in depreciation and interest expenses.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The provision for losses on investment in securities declined by $351 thousand as the 2010 amount included a $356 thousand impairment loss recognized on an equity investment resulting from an approximate 79% reduction in valuation as determined by investee cash burn and potential for additional venture investors.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Likewise, the provision for credit losses decreased by $126 thousand as the 2010 amount included an incremental reserve relative to a fully reserved impaired note receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Outside services expense declined by $103 thousand largely due to an approximate $54 thousand reimbursement of expenses advanced to facilitate the liquidation of the asset holdings of the aforementioned delinquent borrower coupled with a year over year decline in expenses related to business development; and, acquisition expense decreased by $96 thousand primarily as a result of the year over year decline in acquisition activity.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in expenses were increases in depreciation and interest expenses totaling $389 thousand and $106 thousand, respectively.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in depreciation expense was largely due to a year over year increase in the Company s lease asset portfolio; and, the increase in interest expense was mainly due to new non-recourse debt originally obtained during the second half of 2010 to fund the acquisition of certain operating lease assets.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	The primary source of liquidity for the Company has been its cash flow from fixed-term leasing activities.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	As the lease terms expire, the Company will re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	The future liquidity beyond the contractual minimum rentals will depend on the Company s success in remarketing or selling the equipment as it comes off-rental.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Throughout the Reinvestment Period (as defined in the Operating Agreement), the Company anticipates reinvesting a portion of lease payments from assets owned, and/or payments received on notes receivable, in new leasing or financing transactions.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Such reinvestment will occur only after the payment of all obligations, including debt service (both principal and interest), the payment of management fees to the Manager and providing for cash distributions to the Members.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	If inflation in the general economy becomes significant, it may affect the Company in as much as the residual (resale) values and rates on re-leases of the Company s leased assets may increase as the costs of similar assets increase.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	However, the Company s revenues from existing leases and notes would not increase as such rates are generally fixed for the terms of the leases and notes without adjustment for inflation.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	In addition, if interest rates increase significantly under such circumstances, the rates that the Company can obtain on future lease or financing transactions will be expected to increase as the cost of capital is a significant factor in the pricing of leases and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	Leases and notes already in place, for the most part, would not be affected by changes in interest rates.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company s primary source of liquidity was cash flow from its portfolio of operating and direct financing lease contracts, and its investments in notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	In addition, the Company utilized borrowings totaling $632 thousand and $3.8 million for the respective twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 to fund the acquisition of certain operating lease assets and fund new loans.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	During 2010, the Company received a $1.7 million payment from an affiliate relative to a December 31, 2009 reassignment of a newly purchased lease asset.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	During the same comparative years, cash was primarily used to either purchase equipment for long-term operating leases or fund investments in notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Total equipment purchased amounted to $3.2 million and $4.5 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, while loans funded totaled $1.3 million during 2010 as compared to none during the current year.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Cash was also used to pay distributions to both the Other Members and the Managing Member, totaling a combined $2.9 million for each of the years 2011 and 2010.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	In addition, cash was used to partially pay down $1.6 million of debt during 2011; and, to purchase investment securities and pay trade payables and other expenses during both 2011 and 2010.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company participates with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility (the Acquisition Facility ) and a warehouse facility (the Warehouse Facility ) to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate, with a syndicate of financial institutions.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Credit Facility includes certain financial and non-financial covenants applicable to each borrower, including the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Such covenants include covenants typically found in credit facilities of the size and nature of the Credit Facility, such as accuracy of representations, good standing, absence of liens and material litigation, etc.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	The Company considers certain financial covenants to be material to its ongoing use of the Credit Facility and these covenants are described below.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain a specific tangible net worth, to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and to comply with other terms expressed in the Credit Facility, including limitation on the incurrence of additional debt and guaranties, defaults, and delinquencies.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The material financial covenants are summarized as follows:
1394922_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Minimum Tangible Net Worth: $7.5 million Leverage Ratio (leverage to Tangible Net Worth): Not to exceed 1.25 to 1 Collateral Value:
1394922_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	EBITDA is defined under the Credit Facility as, for the relevant period of time (1) gross revenues (all payments from leases and notes receivable) for such period minus (2) expenses deducted in determining net income for such period plus (3) to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period (a) provision for income taxes and (b) interest expense, and (c) depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Extraordinary items and gains or losses on (and proceeds from) sales or dispositions of assets outside of the ordinary course of business are excluded in the calculation of EBITDA.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Tangible Net Worth is defined as, as of the date of determination, (i) the net worth of the Company, after deducting therefrom (without duplication of deductions) the net book amount of all assets of the Company, after deducting any reserves and other amounts for assets which would be treated as intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and after certain other adjustments permitted under the agreements.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The financial covenants referred to above are applicable to the Company only to the extent that the Company has borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company s Tangible Net Worth requirement under the Credit Facility was $7.5 million, the permitted maximum leverage ratio was 1.25 to 1, and the required minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) was 2 to 1.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	The Company was in compliance with each of these financial covenants with a minimum Tangible Net Worth, leverage ratio and (EBITDA) interest coverage ratio, as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement of $14.1 million, 0.20 to 1, and 24.76 to 1, respectively, as of December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	As such, as of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such material financial covenants.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	For purposes of compliance with the Credit Facility covenants, the Company uses a financial calculation of EBITDA, as defined therein, which is a non-GAAP financial performance measure.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The EBITDA is utilized by the Company to calculate its debt covenant ratios.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1394922_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The terms of the Credit Facility include standard events of default by the Company which, if not cured within applicable grace periods, could give lenders remedies against the Company, including the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings and a demand for repayment in advance of their stated maturity.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	If a breach of any material term of the Credit Facility should occur, the lenders may, at their option, increase borrowing rates, accelerate the obligations in advance of their stated maturities, terminate the facility, and exercise rights of collection available to them under the express terms of the facility, or by operation of law.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	The lenders also retain the discretion to waive a violation of any covenant at the Company s request.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company is currently in compliance with its obligations under the Credit Facility.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	In the event of a technical default (e.g., the failure to timely file a required report, or a one-time breach of a financial covenant), the Company believes it has ample time to request and be granted a waiver by the lenders, or, alternatively, cure the default under the existing provisions of its debt agreements, including, if necessary, arranging for additional capital from alternate sources to satisfy outstanding obligations.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The lending syndicate providing the Credit Facility has a blanket lien on all of the Company s assets as collateral for any and all borrowings under the Acquisition Facility, and on a pro-rata basis under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Acquisition Facility is generally recourse solely to the Company, and is not cross-defaulted to any other obligations of affiliated companies under the Credit Facility, except as described in this paragraph.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Credit Facility is cross-defaulted to a default in the payment of any debt (other than non-recourse debt) or any other agreement or condition beyond the period of grace (not exceeding 30 days), the effect of which would entitle the lender under such agreement to accelerate the obligations prior to their stated maturity in an individual or aggregate principal amount in excess of 15% of the Company s consolidated Tangible Net Worth.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Also, a bankruptcy of AFS will trigger a default for the Company under the Credit Facility.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling $2.8 million.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	The notes are secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	For detailed information on the Company s debt obligations, see Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions, based on cash flows from operations, beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had commitments to purchase lease assets totaling approximately $5.0 million and to fund investments in notes receivable totaling approximately $250 thousand (see Note 10, Commitments, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).
1394922_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the financial statements, Summary of significant accounting policies, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management of the Company to be critical to an understanding of the Company s financial statements because their application requires significantly complex or subjective judgments, decisions, or assessments, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	The Company also states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P56_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P59_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P60_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual contract term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P61_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the assets and its carrying value on the measurement date.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ATEL 12, LLC as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:
1394922_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Associates 12, LLC (the Managing Member ), a Nevada limited liability company.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	As of December 31, 2011, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, totaling $30.0 million (inclusive of the $500 initial member s capital investment) have been received and 2,993,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the Units.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	These reclassifications had no significant effect on the reported financial position or results of operations.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after December 31, 2011, up until the issuance of the financial statements.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	No events were noted which would require disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowances for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, operating and direct financing lease receivables, notes receivable and accounts receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company places the majority of its cash deposits in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts which are fully insured, without limit, through December 31, 2012 under the Dodd-Frank amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	This unlimited coverage is separate from, and in addition to, the coverage provided to depositors with other accounts held at a depository institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P20_S3	The remainder of the Funds cash is temporarily invested in U.S. Treasury denominated instruments.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P20_S4	The concentration of such deposits and temporary cash investments is not deemed to create a significant risk to the Company.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Accounts and notes receivable represent amounts due from lessees or borrowers in various industries, related to equipment on operating leases or notes receivable.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P25_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P25_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P29_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P29_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P32_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P32_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P32_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P34_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P34_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection and acquisition of equipment which are reimbursable to the Managing Member under the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	As the costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P36_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P36_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in the United States.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company s principal decision makers are the Managing Member s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company believes that its equipment leasing business operates as one reportable segment because: a) the Company measures profit and loss at the equipment portfolio level as a whole; b) the principal decision makers do not review information based on any operating segment other than the equipment leasing transaction portfolio; c) the Company does not maintain discrete financial information on any specific segment other than its equipment financing operations; d) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around different products and services other than equipment lease financing; and e) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around geographic areas.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company sought leasing opportunities were North America and Europe.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	For the years ended December, 2011 and 2010, and as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, 100% of the Company s operating revenues and long-lived assets are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	At June 30, 2011, the Company deemed an investment security to be impaired and recorded a fair value adjustment of $5 thousand which reduced the cost basis of the investment.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Accounts receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	The asset underlying a direct financing lease contract is considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its net book value.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P75_S3	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P82_S2	If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	Substandard Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	Accounts that are so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Fund will sustain some loss as the likelihood of fully collecting all receivables may be questionable if the deficiencies are not corrected.

1394922_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P132_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P136_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no assets or liabilities that required measurement at fair value on a recurring basis.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P137_S1	During the first three quarters of 2011, the Company recorded adjustments to reflect the fair value of impaired notes receivable and impaired investment securities on a non-recurring basis.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P137_S2	There were no additional fair value adjustments at December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company recorded adjustments to reflect the value of impaired investments securities on a non-recurring basis.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P138_S1	Such fair value adjustments utilized the following methodology:
1394922_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is estimated using either third party appraisals of collateral or discounted cash flow analyses based upon current market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, with adjustments for non-accrual loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P139_S1	At September 30, 2011, the Company deemed a note receivable impaired based upon an independent appraisal of the underlying collateral.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P139_S2	Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-recurring adjustment totaling $4 thousand which reduced the cost basis of the note.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the impaired notes receivable is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	Such valuation utilizes a market approach technique and uses inputs from third party appraisers that utilize current market transactions as adjusted for certain factors specific to the underlying collateral.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P141_S1	No additional adjustment was deemed necessary at December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P142_S1	The investment securities are adjusted for impairment, if any, based upon factors which include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P142_S2	At June 30, 2011, the Company had recorded a fair value adjustment of $5 thousand which reduced the cost basis of an investment deemed impaired at June 30, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P142_S3	The non-recurring fair value adjustment was based on an approximate 25% reduction in valuation based on the expected value of shares of the venture company as contemplated in its merger agreement terms.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P142_S4	There was no incremental impairment to investment securities at December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	At December 31, 2010, a fair value adjustment of approximately $356 thousand was recorded relative to an impaired security based on an approximate 79% reduction in valuation as determined by investee cash burn and potential for additional venture investors.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P143_S1	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of these impaired investment securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy due to the significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	The following tables present the fair value measurements of impaired assets measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis during 2011 and 2010, and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1394922_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P145_S1	Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P146_S1	Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P146_S2	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, with adjustments for non-accrual loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon the current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.
1394922_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	The following table presents estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

1394922_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, Management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

1394922_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Management of the Managing Member is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) for the Company, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
1394922_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The internal control process of the Managing Member, as it is applicable to the Company, was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1394922_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1394922_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1394922_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation.
1394922_12_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1394922_12_ITEM10_P13_S0	A Code of Ethics that is applicable to the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Associates 12, LLC, or persons acting in such capacity on behalf of the Company, is included as Exhibit 14.1 to this report.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P0_S0	The registrant has no officers or directors.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P1_S0	Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P1_S1	The amount of such remuneration paid for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is set forth in Item 8 of this report under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Financial Statements Related party transactions, at Note 7 thereof, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P2_S0	The Company paid selling commissions in the amount of 9% of Gross Proceeds, as defined, to ATEL Securities Corporation, an affiliate of the Manager.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P3_S0	Through December 31, 2009, $2.7 million of such commissions had either been accrued or paid to ASC.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P3_S1	Of that amount, $2.3 million has been re-allowed to other broker/dealers.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P3_S2	The Company did not incur any additional selling commissions subsequent to December 31, 2009.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Company pays the Manager an Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4% of Operating Revenues, which includes Gross Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P4_S1	The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P4_S2	The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5% of all Company Distributions.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P7_S0	AFS supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees/borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P7_S1	AFS intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P8_S1	While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor s understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P8_S2	The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P9_S0	The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. ( NASAA ) is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P9_S1	NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ).
1394922_12_ITEM11_P9_S2	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P9_S3	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P9_S4	The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund s prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ).
1394922_12_ITEM11_P9_S5	Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund s term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager s Carried Interest, as described below.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P10_S1	To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P10_S2	To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P10_S3	Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P11_S3	[50% x .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_12_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P13_S0	With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5% + 5% = 11.5%), and 7.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5% + 1% = 7.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P13_S1	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P14_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P14_S1	If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P14_S2	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P14_S3	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
1394922_12_ITEM11_P15_S0	See Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.

1394922_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the course of business of the Company, this Code of Ethics serves only as a rough guide.

1394922_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2012, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial member s capital investment) have been received and 2,993,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the limited liability company units (Units).
1394922_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company has acquired and intends to acquire various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and to make loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as materials handling equipment, manufacturing equipment, mining equipment, and transportation equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	A portion of the portfolio will include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	The Company will also seek investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company only purchases equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease will be entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Through December 31, 2012, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of $27.7 million.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company had also loaned $4.5 million for notes receivable secured by various assets.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company s objective is to have at least 60% of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, will consist of real estate investments.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P10_S4	The Company s objective is to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	During 2012 and 2011, certain lessees generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues as follows:
1394922_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments owned at any time during the reinvestment period; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30 million); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities are North America and Europe.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Currently, 100% of the Company s operating revenues are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company has no full time employees.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company has acquired a diversified portfolio of equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	The equipment has been leased to lessees in various industries.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	The following tables set forth the types of equipment acquired by the Company through December 31, 2012 and the industries to which the assets have been leased (dollars in thousands):
1394922_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	From inception to December 31, 2012, the Company has disposed of certain leased assets as set forth below (in thousands):
1394922_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	For further information regarding the Company s equipment lease portfolio as of December 31, 2012, see Note 6 to the financial statements, Investments in equipment and leases, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company finances assets in diverse industries.
1394922_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	The following tables set forth the types of assets financed by the Company through December 31, 2012 and the industries to which the assets have been financed (dollars in thousands):
1394922_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	From inception to December 31, 2012, assets financed by the Company that are associated with terminated loans are as follows (in thousands):
1394922_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	For further information regarding the Company s note receivable portfolio as of December 31, 2012, see Note 4 to the financial statements, Notes receivable, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company does not own or lease any real property, plant or material physical properties other than the equipment held for lease as set forth in Item 1, Business.
1394922_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2012, a total of 905 investors were Unitholders of record in the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	As noted above, there is no public market for Units and, in order to preserve the Company s status for federal income tax purposes, the Company will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	Nevertheless, in order to provide an estimated per Unit value for those Unitholders who seek valuation information, the Manager has calculated an estimated value per Unit as of December 31, 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Manager estimates the Company s per Unit value by first estimating the aggregate net asset value of the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	The valuation does not take into account any future business activity of the Company; rather it is a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as any current assets and liabilities, as well as for any investment in securities, were assumed to equal their reported balances, which management believes approximate their fair values, as adjusted for impairment.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	The same was applied to loans incurred under the acquisition facility since they bear variable rates of interest.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	A discounted cash flow approach was used to estimate the values of notes receivable, investments in leases and non-recourse debt.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	Under such approach, the value of a financial instrument was estimated by calculating the present value of the instrument s expected cash flows.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P6_S2	The present value was determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by discount rates as deemed appropriate by the Manager.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P6_S3	In most cases, the discount rates used were based on U.S. Treasury yields reported as of the reporting date, plus a spread to account for the credit risk difference between the instrument being valued and Treasury securities.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	After calculating the aggregate estimated net asset value of the Company, the Manager then calculated the portion of the aggregate estimated value that would be distributed to Unitholders on liquidation of the Company, and divided the total that would be so distributable by the number of outstanding Units as of the December 31, 2012 valuation date.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the value of the Company s assets, calculated on this basis, was approximately $9.04 per Unit.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	The foregoing valuation was performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated liquidation value per Unit for those Unitholders who seek valuation information.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P8_S1	It is important to note again that there is no market for the Units, and, accordingly, this value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unitholder would receive if he were to seek to sell his Units.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P9_S0	The Company will liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and investment cycle.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P9_S1	Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to when the Company will be fully liquidated, the amount the Company may actually receive if and when it seeks to liquidate its assets, the amount of lease payments and equipment disposition proceeds the Company will actually receive over the remaining term of the Company, or the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unitholders over the course of the Company s remaining term.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P10_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.

1394922_13_ITEM5_P12_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions in February 2008.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P12_S1	The rate for monthly distributions from 2012 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P12_S2	Likewise the rate for monthly distributions from 2011 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2011.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P12_S3	The rate for each of the quarterly distributions paid in 2012 and 2011 was $0.225 per Unit.
1394922_13_ITEM5_P13_S0	The following table presents summarized information regarding distributions to Other Members:

1394922_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) is a California limited liability company that was formed in January 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ), primarily in the United States.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	As of September 25, 2009, the offering was terminated.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	On January 29, 2008, the Fund made its first investment in a long-term operating lease.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company has purchased a total of $27.7 million of equipment for long-term operating and direct financing leases and funded investments in notes receivable totaling $4.5 million.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Subsequently, during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company will reinvest cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the Other Members and/or utilize its credit facilities to acquire additional equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ends December 31, 2015, the Company anticipates continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement ( Operating Agreement ), as amended.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were concentrations (greater than 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financial borrowers in certain industries as follows:
1394922_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	As previously mentioned, certain lessees generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues during 2012 and 2011 as follows:
1394922_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods due to anticipated changes in the mix of investments and/or lessees as a result of normal business activities.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment; as such, utilization rates may tend to decrease during the liquidation stage of the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	All of the Company s leased property was acquired during the period from 2008 to 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 98% and 100% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company had net income of $291 thousand and $174 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Results for 2012 reflect decreases in both total operating expenses and total revenues when compared to prior year.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Total revenues for 2012 decreased by $568 thousand, or 11%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The decrease was mostly due to a reduction in operating lease revenues which was lower by $525 thousand largely as a result of run-off and sales of lease assets.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Total expenses for 2012 decreased by $685 thousand, or 14%, as compared to prior year, primarily due to lower depreciation and acquisition expenses offset, in part, by increases in outside services expense and the provision for credit losses.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The decrease in depreciation expense totaled $684 thousand and was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets while the decline in acquisition expense totaled $48 thousand and was a result of the year over year decrease in lease and loan origination activity.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in expenses were increases in outside services expense and the provision for credit losses totaling $65 thousand and $51 thousand, respectively.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in outside services was mainly attributable to an approximate $54 thousand third quarter 2011 reimbursement of expenses advanced to facilitate the liquidation of the asset holdings of a delinquent borrower.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	The increase in the provision for credit losses primarily reflect $45 thousand of fair value adjustments made to notes receivable deemed impaired during 2012 coupled with an increase in the allowance relative to delinquent receivables.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $319 thousand and $1.9 million, respectively.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The primary source of liquidity for the Company has been its cash flow from fixed-term leasing activities.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	As the lease terms expire, the Company will re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	The future liquidity beyond the contractual minimum rentals will depend on the Company s success in remarketing or selling the equipment as it comes off-rental.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Throughout the Reinvestment Period (as defined in the Operating Agreement), the Company anticipates reinvesting a portion of lease payments from assets owned, and/or payments received on notes receivable, in new leasing or financing transactions.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Such reinvestment will occur only after the payment of all obligations, including debt service (both principal and interest), the payment of management fees to the Manager and providing for cash distributions to the Members.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	If inflation in the general economy becomes significant, it may affect the Company in as much as the residual (resale) values and rates on re-leases of the Company s leased assets may increase as the costs of similar assets increase.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	However, the Company s revenues from existing leases and notes would not increase as such rates are generally fixed for the terms of the leases and notes without adjustment for inflation.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	In addition, if interest rates increase significantly under such circumstances, the rates that the Company can obtain on future lease or financing transactions will be expected to increase as the cost of capital is a significant factor in the pricing of leases and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	Leases and notes already in place, for the most part, would not be affected by changes in interest rates.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	During 2012 and 2011, the Company s primary sources of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating and direct financing lease contracts, and its investments in notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Moreover, the Company utilized borrowings totaling $3.5 million and $632 thousand for the respective twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and realized $393 thousand and $297 thousand of proceeds from sales of lease assets and/or the early termination of notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	During the same comparative years, cash was primarily used to acquire lease assets and to fund investments in notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Total equipment purchased amounted to $2.6 million and $3.2 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively, while loans funded totaled $1.4 million during 2012 as compared to none during the prior year.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	In addition, cash was used to pay distributions to both Other Members and the Managing Member, totaling a combined $2.9 million for each of the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and to pay down $2.9 million and $1.6 million of debt.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	During the prior year, cash was also used to purchase investment securities totaling $127 thousand and to pay down liabilities related to costs reimbursable to affiliates.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company participates with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility (the Acquisition Facility ) and a warehouse facility (the Warehouse Facility ) to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate, with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Credit Facility includes certain financial and non-financial covenants applicable to each borrower, including the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Such covenants include covenants typically found in credit facilities of the size and nature of the Credit Facility, such as accuracy of representations, good standing, absence of liens and material litigation, etc.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company considers certain financial covenants to be material to its ongoing use of the Credit Facility and these covenants are described below.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain a specific tangible net worth, to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and to comply with other terms expressed in the Credit Facility, including limitation on the incurrence of additional debt and guaranties, defaults, and delinquencies.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	The material financial covenants are summarized as follows:
1394922_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Minimum Tangible Net Worth: $7.5 million Leverage Ratio (leverage to Tangible Net Worth): Not to exceed 1.25 to 1 Collateral Value:
1394922_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	EBITDA is defined under the Credit Facility as, for the relevant period of time (1) gross revenues (all payments from leases and notes receivable) for such period minus (2) expenses deducted in determining net income for such period plus (3) to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period (a) provision for income taxes and (b) interest expense, and (c) depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Extraordinary items and gains or losses on (and proceeds from) sales or dispositions of assets outside of the ordinary course of business are excluded in the calculation of EBITDA.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Tangible Net Worth is defined as, as of the date of determination, (i) the net worth of the Company, after deducting therefrom (without duplication of deductions) the net book amount of all assets of the Company, after deducting any reserves and other amounts for assets which would be treated as intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and after certain other adjustments permitted under the agreements.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	The financial covenants referred to above are applicable to the Company only to the extent that the Company has borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company s Tangible Net Worth requirement under the Credit Facility was $7.5 million, the permitted maximum leverage ratio was 1.25 to 1, and the required minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) was 2 to 1.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	The Company was in compliance with each of these financial covenants with a minimum Tangible Net Worth, leverage ratio and (EBITDA) interest coverage ratio, as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement of $11.5 million, 0.30 to 1, and 36.67 to 1, respectively, as of December 31, 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	As such, as of December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all such material financial covenants.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	For purposes of compliance with the Credit Facility covenants, the Company uses a financial calculation of EBITDA, as defined therein, which is a non-GAAP financial performance measure.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The EBITDA is utilized by the Company to calculate its debt covenant ratios.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, as defined in the loan agreement, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 (in thousands):
1394922_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	The terms of the Credit Facility include standard events of default by the Company which, if not cured within applicable grace periods, could give lenders remedies against the Company, including the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings and a demand for repayment in advance of their stated maturity.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	If a breach of any material term of the Credit Facility should occur, the lenders may, at their option, increase borrowing rates, accelerate the obligations in advance of their stated maturities, terminate the facility, and exercise rights of collection available to them under the express terms of the facility, or by operation of law.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	The lenders also retain the discretion to waive a violation of any covenant at the Company s request.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company is currently in compliance with its obligations under the Credit Facility.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	In the event of a technical default (e.g., the failure to timely file a required report, or a one-time breach of a financial covenant), the Company believes it has ample time to request and be granted a waiver by the lenders, or, alternatively, cure the default under the existing provisions of its debt agreements, including, if necessary, arranging for additional capital from alternate sources to satisfy outstanding obligations.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	The lending syndicate providing the Credit Facility has a blanket lien on all of the Company s assets as collateral for any and all borrowings under the Acquisition Facility, and on a pro-rata basis under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Acquisition Facility is generally recourse solely to the Company, and is not cross-defaulted to any other obligations of affiliated companies under the Credit Facility, except as described in this paragraph.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Credit Facility is cross-defaulted to a default in the payment of any debt (other than non-recourse debt) or any other agreement or condition beyond the period of grace (not exceeding 30 days), the effect of which would entitle the lender under such agreement to accelerate the obligations prior to their stated maturity in an individual or aggregate principal amount in excess of 15% of the Company s consolidated Tangible Net Worth.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Also, a bankruptcy of AFS will trigger a default for the Company under the Credit Facility.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling $3.4 million.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	The notes are secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	For detailed information on the Company s debt obligations, see Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions, based on cash flows from operations, beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had commitments to purchase lease assets totaling approximately $1.0 million and to fund investments in notes receivable totaling approximately $350 thousand (see Note 10, Commitments, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).
1394922_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Recent accounting standards updates as issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) were evaluated and determined to be not applicable to the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management of the Company to be critical to an understanding of the Company s financial statements because their application requires significantly complex or subjective judgments, decisions, or assessments, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Company also states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P58_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P58_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual contract term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P60_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the assets and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	See the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements attached hereto at pages 15 through 38 .
1394922_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ATEL 12, LLC (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of income, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Management of the Company s Managing Member.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1394922_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ATEL 12, LLC as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:
1394922_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Associates 12, LLC (the Managing Member ), a Nevada limited liability company.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the Units.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after December 31, 2012, up until the issuance of the financial statements.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowances for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P25_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P25_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P31_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P32_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P32_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P32_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual lease term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P34_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P34_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection and acquisition of equipment which are reimbursable to the Managing Member under the terms of the Operating Agreement.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P36_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P36_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Based upon the Company s review of its portfolio, no fair value adjustment was deemed necessary during 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	During the second quarter of 2011, the Company deemed an investment security to be impaired and recorded a fair value adjustment of $5 thousand which reduced the cost basis of the investment.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company records prepayments on operating leases as a liability under the caption of unearned operating lease income.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	The liability is recorded when prepayments are received and recognized as operating lease revenue over the period to which the prepayments relate using a straight-line method.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	Pursuant to the provisions of Section 701 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is not subject to federal income taxes.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided current franchise income taxes for only those states which levy income taxes on partnerships.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based upon their aging and historical charge off and collection experience and the creditworthiness of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Accounts receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with lease or note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	Based upon management s judgment, such leases or notes may be placed in non-accrual status.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	Leases or notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P68_S4	Until such time, revenues on operating leases are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P68_S5	All payments received on amounts billed under direct financing leases contracts and notes receivable are applied only against outstanding principal balances.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P70_S3	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	The asset underlying a direct financing lease contract is considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its net book value.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P71_S3	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Substandard Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Accounts that are so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Fund will sustain some loss as the likelihood of fully collecting all receivables may be questionable if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	Such accounts are on the Manager s Credit Watch List.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Doubtful Any account where the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

1394922_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P131_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no assets or liabilities that required measurement at fair value on a recurring basis.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	During 2012, the Company recorded non-recurring adjustments to reflect the fair value of impaired notes receivable.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	During 2011, the Company recorded non-recurring adjustments to impaired notes receivable and impaired investment securities.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P133_S2	Amounts at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 reflect the fair value of the then existing impaired assets.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	The Company s valuation policy is determined by members of the Asset Management, Credit and Accounting departments.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P134_S2	Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P134_S3	These techniques are significantly affected by certain of the Company s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P134_S4	Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	Such analysis is performed by asset management and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P135_S2	The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	Such fair value adjustments utilized the following methodology:
1394922_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is estimated using either third party appraisals of collateral or discounted cash flow analyses based upon current market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, with adjustments for non-accrual loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	During 2012, the Company recorded $45 thousand of adjustments to reflect the fair value of three impaired notes.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P137_S2	The Company had previously recorded $4 thousand of adjustments on two of the impaired notes through December 2011.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P137_S3	Such adjustments were non-recurring and were based upon an independent appraisal of the underlying collateral.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the impaired notes receivable is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	Such valuation utilizes a market approach technique and uses inputs from third party appraisers that utilize current market transactions as adjusted for certain factors specific to the underlying collateral.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P140_S1	The investment securities are adjusted for impairment, if any, based upon factors which include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P140_S2	Based upon the Company s review of its securities portfolio, no fair value adjustments were deemed necessary during 2012.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P140_S3	During 2011, the Company had recorded a fair value adjustment of $5 thousand which reduced the cost basis of an investment deemed impaired.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P140_S4	The non-recurring fair value adjustment was based on an approximate 25% reduction in valuation based on the expected value of shares of the venture company as contemplated in its merger agreement terms.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P140_S5	Subsequent to the merger, no additional impairment has been defined.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	The following table presents the fair value measurement of impaired assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
1394922_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P142_S1	Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P143_S1	Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P143_S2	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or has realized in a current market exchange.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P143_S3	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is estimated using either third party appraisals of collateral or discounted cash flow analyses based upon current market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, with adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.
1394922_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	The following table presents a summary of the carrying value and fair value by level of financial instruments not recorded at fair value on the Company s balance sheet at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):

1394922_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1394922_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1394922_13_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation.
1394922_13_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1394922_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.

1394922_13_ITEM11_P1_S0	Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates.

1394922_13_ITEM11_P2_S0	The Company paid selling commissions in the amount of 9% of Gross Proceeds, as defined, to ATEL Securities Corporation, an affiliate of the Manager.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P3_S0	Through December 31, 2009, $2.7 million of such commissions had either been accrued or paid to ASC.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P3_S1	Of that amount, $2.3 million has been re-allowed to other broker/dealers.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P3_S2	The Company did not incur any additional selling commissions subsequent to December 31, 2009.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Company pays the Manager an Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4% of Operating Revenues, which includes Gross Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P4_S1	The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P4_S2	The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5% of all Company Distributions.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P7_S0	AFS supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees/borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P7_S1	AFS intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P8_S1	While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor's understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states' merit review guidelines.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P8_S2	The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P9_S0	The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. ( NASAA ) is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P9_S1	NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ).
1394922_13_ITEM11_P9_S2	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P9_S3	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P9_S4	The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund's prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ).
1394922_13_ITEM11_P9_S5	Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund's term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager's Carried Interest, as described below.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P10_S1	To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P10_S2	To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P10_S3	Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund's equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P11_S3	Based on the formula in the NASAA Guidelines, the Fund's minimum Investment in Equipment would equal 76.875% of Gross Proceeds (80% [50% .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund's minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_13_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P13_S0	before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P14_S0	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P15_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager's Carried Interest.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P15_S1	If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager's Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P15_S2	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P15_S3	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
1394922_13_ITEM11_P16_S0	See Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.
1394922_13_ITEM12_P0_S0	At December 31, 2012, no investor is known to hold beneficially more than 5% of the issued and outstanding Units.

1394922_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	This fundamental standard of honest and ethical conduct extends to the handling of conflicts of interest.
1394922_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	The Covered Officers shall avoid any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company, and any personal activities, investments, or associations that might give rise to such conflicts.

1394922_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	The Covered Officers shall not knowingly conceal or falsify information, misrepresent material facts, or omit material facts necessary to avoid misleading the Company s independent public auditors or investors.
1394922_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	In conducting the business of the Company, the Covered Officers shall comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations at all levels of government in the United States and in any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which the Company does business, as well as applicable rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations of which the Company is a member.

1394922_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Company s Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, LLC ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability corporation.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial Services, LLC ( AFS ) (the Managing Member or Manager ), a Nevada limited liability corporation, which assumed the role of Managing Member of the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2013, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial member s capital investment) have been received and 2,993,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the Units.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company has acquired and intends to acquire various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and to make loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as materials handling equipment, manufacturing equipment, mining equipment, and transportation equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	A portion of the portfolio will include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	The Company will also seek investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company only purchases equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease will be entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Through December 31, 2013, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of $28.6 million.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Company had also loaned $5.4 million for notes receivable secured by various assets.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company s objective is to have at least 60% of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Investors Service, Inc. of Baa or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or are public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, will consist of real estate investments.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P10_S4	The Company s objective is to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	During 2013 and 2012, certain lessees and/or financial borrowers generated significant portions (defined as greater than or equal to 10%) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues, excluding gains or losses on disposition of assets, as follows:
1394922_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments owned at any time during the reinvestment period; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30 million); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities are North America and Europe.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Currently, 100% of the Company s operating revenues are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company has no full time employees.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company has acquired a diversified portfolio of equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	The equipment has been leased to lessees in various industries.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	The following tables set forth the types of equipment acquired by the Company through December 31, 2013 and the industries to which the assets have been leased (dollars in thousands):
1394922_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	From inception to December 31, 2013, the Company has disposed of certain leased assets as set forth below (in thousands):
1394922_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	For further information regarding the Company s equipment lease portfolio as of December 31, 2013, see Note 6 to the financial statements, Investments in equipment and leases, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company finances assets in diverse industries.
1394922_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The following tables set forth the types of assets financed by the Company through December 31, 2013 and the industries to which the assets have been financed (dollars in thousands):
1394922_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	From inception to December 31, 2013, assets financed by the Company that are associated with terminated loans are as follows (in thousands):
1394922_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	For further information regarding the Company s notes receivable portfolio as of December 31, 2013, see Note 4 to the financial statements, Notes receivable, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company does not own or lease any real property, plant or material physical properties other than the equipment held for lease as set forth in Item 1, Business.
1394922_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2013, a total of 907 investors were Unitholders of record in the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	As noted above, there is no public market for Units and, in order to preserve the Company s status for federal income tax purposes, the Company will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Nevertheless, in order to provide an estimated per Unit value for those Unitholders who seek valuation information, AFS has calculated an estimated value per Unit as of December 31, 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	AFS estimates the Company s per unit value by estimating the aggregate net asset value of the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	The valuation does not take into account any future business activity of the Company; rather it is a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as any current assets and liabilities, as well as for any investment in securities, were assumed to equal their respective reported balances, which management believes approximate their respective fair values, as adjusted for impairment.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	And when applicable, the same was applied to loans incurred under the receivables funding program and the acquisition facility since they also bear variable rates of interest.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	A discounted cash flow approach was used to estimate the values of notes receivable, investments in leases and non-recourse debt.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	Under such approach, the value of a financial instrument was estimated by calculating the present value of the instrument s expected cash flows.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P6_S2	The present value was determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by discount rates as deemed appropriate by the Manager.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P6_S3	In most cases, the discount rates used were based on U.S. Treasury yields reported as of the reporting date, plus a spread to account for the credit risk difference between the instrument being valued and Treasury securities.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	The valuation of the Company s warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	After calculating the aggregate estimated net asset value of the Company, AFS then calculated the portion of the aggregate estimated value that would be distributed to Unitholders on liquidation of the Company, and divided the total that would be so distributable by the number of outstanding Units as of the December 31, 2013 valuation date.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P8_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the value of the Company s assets, calculated on this basis, was approximately $6.35 per Unit.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P9_S0	The aforementioned valuation was performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated liquidation value per Unit for those Unitholders who seek valuation information.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P9_S1	It is important to note again that there is no market for the Units, and, accordingly, this value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unitholder would receive if he were to seek to sell his Units.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P10_S0	The Company will liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and investment cycle.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P10_S1	Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to when the Company will be fully liquidated, the amount the Company may actually receive if and when it seeks to liquidate its assets, the amount of lease payments and equipment disposition proceeds the Company will actually receive over the remaining term of the Company, or the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unitholders over the course of the Company s remaining term.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P11_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P12_S0	The Managing Member has sole discretion in determining the amount of distributions; provided, however, that the Managing Member will not cause the Company to reinvest operating revenues in equipment, but will distribute available cash, subject to payment of any obligations of the Company, (i) in an amount sufficient to allow an investor in a 31% federal income tax bracket to meet the federal and state income taxes due on income from the operations of the Fund; (ii) through the first full fiscal quarter ending at least six months after termination of the offering of Units, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) a rate of return on their original capital contribution equal to 2.5% over the average yield on five-year United States Treasury Bonds for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of distribution, as published in a national financial newspaper from time to time (with a minimum of 8% per annum and a maximum of 9% per annum), or (b) 90% of the total amount of cash available for distributions; and (iii) for each quarter during the rest of the reinvestment period, an amount equal to 9% per annum on their original capital contribution.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P13_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions in February 2008.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P13_S1	The rate for monthly distributions from 2013 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P13_S2	Likewise the rate for monthly distributions from 2012 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2012.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P13_S3	The rate for each of the quarterly distributions paid in 2013 and 2012 was $0.225 per Unit.
1394922_14_ITEM5_P14_S0	The following table presents summarized information regarding distributions to Other Members:
1394922_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	A smaller reporting company is not required to present selected financial data in accordance with item 301(c) of Regulation S-K.

1394922_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms.

1394922_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) is a California limited liability company that was formed in January 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ), primarily in the United States.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	As of September 25, 2009, the offering was terminated.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2009, the Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Subsequently, during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company has utilized its credit facilities and reinvested cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the Other Members to acquire additional equipment and/or to fund financing transactions.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ends December 31, 2015, the Company anticipates continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement ( Operating Agreement ), as amended.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were concentrations (greater than or equal to 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financed for borrowers in certain industries as follows:
1394922_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	As previously mentioned, certain lessees and/or financial borrowers generated significant portions (defined as greater than or equal to 10%) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues, excluding gains or losses on disposition of assets, during 2013 and 2012 as follows:
1394922_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods due to anticipated changes in the mix of investments and/or lessees as a result of normal business activities.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment; as such, utilization rates may tend to decrease during the liquidation stage of the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	All of the Company s leased property was acquired during the period from 2008 to 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 99% and 98% as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company had net income of $992 thousand and $291 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Results for 2013 reflect a decrease in total operating expenses and an increase in total revenues when compared to prior year.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total revenues for 2013 increased by $197 thousand, or 4%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The net increase in total revenues was largely attributable to increases in unrealized gain on fair valuation of warrants, other revenue and gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes receivable offset, in part, by a decrease in operating lease revenues.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The increase in unrealized gain on fair valuation of warrants totaled $555 thousand and was attributable to the addition of warrants of certain portfolio companies.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase in other revenue totaled $38 thousand and was largely due to deferred maintenance fees collected during the current year and a franchise tax refund received from the state of California.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Moreover, the increase in gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes totaled $31 thousand and was primarily attributable to an increase in volume and change in the mix of assets sold, and a $27 thousand gain on a note receivable that was fully settled prior to its scheduled maturity.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The aforementioned increases in revenues were partially offset by a $419 thousand decline in operating lease revenues.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Such decrease was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets partially offset by revenue derived from eight new leases which commenced during the first quarter of 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Total operating expenses for 2013 declined by $504 thousand, or 12%, as compared to prior year, primarily as a result of decreases in depreciation expense, the provision for credit losses, asset management fees and cost reimbursements to the Manager.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The decrease in depreciation expense totaled $271 thousand and was mainly a result of run-off and sales of lease assets.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The provision for credit losses declined by $92 thousand largely due to $45 thousand of prior year fair value adjustments on impaired notes coupled with a current year increase in recovery of accounts receivable amounts previously reserved.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Moreover, asset management fees paid to the Managing Member declined by $44 thousand as a result of the decrease in managed assets and related rents; and, cost reimbursements to the Managing Member declined by $43 thousand primarily due to a lower allocation of costs based on the Company s declining asset base.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $857 thousand and $319 thousand, respectively.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The primary source of liquidity for the Company has been its cash flow from fixed-term leasing activities.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	As the lease terms expire, the Company will re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	The future liquidity beyond the contractual minimum rentals will depend on the Company s success in remarketing or selling the equipment as it comes off rental.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Throughout the Reinvestment Period (as defined in the Operating Agreement), the Company anticipates reinvesting a portion of lease payments from assets owned, and/or payments received on notes receivable, in new leasing or financing transactions.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Such reinvestment will occur only after the payment of all obligations, including debt service (both principal and interest), the payment of management fees to the Manager and providing for cash distributions to the Members.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	If inflation in the general economy becomes significant, it may affect the Company in as much as the residual (resale) values and rates on re-leases of the Company s leased assets may increase as the costs of similar assets increase.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	However, the Company s revenues from existing leases and notes would not increase as such rates are generally fixed for the terms of the leases and notes without adjustment for inflation.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	In addition, if interest rates increase significantly under such circumstances, the rates that the Company can obtain on future lease or financing transactions will be expected to increase as the cost of capital is a significant factor in the pricing of leases and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Leases and notes already in place, for the most part, would not be affected by changes in interest rates.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	During 2013 and 2012, the Company s primary sources of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating and direct financing lease contracts, and its investments in notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Moreover, the Company utilized borrowings totaling $2.7 million and $3.5 million, and realized $689 thousand and $393 thousand of proceeds from sales of lease assets and/or the early termination of notes receivable during the respective years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	During the same respective years, cash was primarily used to acquire lease assets and fund investments in notes receivable, pay distributions to both Other Members and the Managing Member, and to pay down debt.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cash used to acquire lease assets totaled $895 thousand and $2.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, while cash used to fund loans totaled $905 thousand and $1.4 million during the same respective years.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Total distributions paid to Members amounted to $2.9 million for each of the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2013 and 2012; and, cash used to pay down debt totaled $2.2 million and $2.9 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company participates with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility (the Acquisition Facility ) and a warehouse facility (the Warehouse Facility ) to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate, with a syndicate of financial institutions.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Credit Facility was for an amount up to $60 million and set to expire in June 2014.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	During January 2014, the line was increased to $75 million and expiration extended to June 2015.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Credit Facility includes certain financial and non-financial covenants applicable to each borrower, including the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Such covenants include covenants typically found in credit facilities of the size and nature of the Credit Facility, such as accuracy of representations, good standing, absence of liens and material litigation, etc.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company considers certain financial covenants to be material to its ongoing use of the Credit Facility and these covenants are described below.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain a specific tangible net worth, to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and to comply with other terms expressed in the Credit Facility, including limitation on the incurrence of additional debt and guaranties, defaults, and delinquencies.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The material financial covenants are summarized as follows:
1394922_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	EBITDA is defined under the Credit Facility as, for the relevant period of time (1) gross revenues (all payments from leases and notes receivable) for such period minus (2) expenses deducted in determining net income for such period plus (3) to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period (a) provision for income taxes and (b) interest expense, and (c) depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Extraordinary items and gains or losses on (and proceeds from) sales or dispositions of assets outside of the ordinary course of business are excluded in the calculation of EBITDA.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Tangible Net Worth is defined as, as of the date of determination, (i) the net worth of the Company, after deducting therefrom (without duplication of deductions) the net book amount of all assets of the Company, after deducting any reserves and other amounts for assets which would be treated as intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and after certain other adjustments permitted under the agreements.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The financial covenants referred to above are applicable to the Company only to the extent that the Company has borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company was in compliance with each of these financial covenants with a minimum Tangible Net Worth, leverage ratio and (EBITDA) interest coverage ratio, as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement of $9.6 million, 0.41 to 1, and 35.10 to 1, respectively, as of December 31, 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	As such, as of December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all such material financial covenants.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	For purposes of compliance with the Credit Facility covenants, the Company uses a financial calculation of EBITDA, as defined therein, which is a non-GAAP financial performance measure.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The EBITDA is utilized by the Company to calculate its debt covenant ratios.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, as defined in the loan agreement, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
1394922_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The terms of the Credit Facility include standard events of default by the Company which, if not cured within applicable grace periods, could give lenders remedies against the Company, including the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings and a demand for repayment in advance of their stated maturity.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	If a breach of any material term of the Credit Facility should occur, the lenders may, at their option, increase borrowing rates, accelerate the obligations in advance of their stated maturities, terminate the facility, and exercise rights of collection available to them under the express terms of the facility, or by operation of law.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	The lenders also retain the discretion to waive a violation of any covenant at the Company s request.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company is currently in compliance with its obligations under the Credit Facility.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	In the event of a technical default (e.g., the failure to timely file a required report, or a one-time breach of a financial covenant), the Company believes it has ample time to request and be granted a waiver by the lenders, or, alternatively, cure the default under the existing provisions of its debt agreements, including, if necessary, arranging for additional capital from alternate sources to satisfy outstanding obligations.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The lending syndicate providing the Credit Facility has a blanket lien on all of the Company s assets as collateral for any and all borrowings under the Acquisition Facility, and on a pro-rata basis under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Acquisition Facility is generally recourse solely to the Company, and is not cross-defaulted to any other obligations of affiliated companies under the Credit Facility, except as described in this paragraph.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	The Credit Facility is cross-defaulted to a default in the payment of any debt (other than non-recourse debt) or any other agreement or condition beyond the period of grace (not exceeding 30 days), the effect of which would entitle the lender under such agreement to accelerate the obligations prior to their stated maturity in an individual or aggregate principal amount in excess of 15% of the Company s consolidated Tangible Net Worth.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Also, a bankruptcy of AFS will trigger a default for the Company under the Credit Facility.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling $4.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	The notes are secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	For detailed information on the Company s debt obligations, see Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions, based on cash flows from operations, beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Such distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had no commitments to purchase lease assets or fund investments in notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Recent accounting standards updates as issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) were evaluated and determined to be not applicable to the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management of the Company to be critical to an understanding of the Company s financial statements because their application requires significantly complex or subjective judgments, decisions, or assessments, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Company also states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P58_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual contract term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P60_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the assets and its carrying value on the measurement date.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Company s Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, LLC ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability corporation.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P6_S2	Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial Services, LLC ( AFS ) (the Managing Member or Manager ), a Nevada limited liability corporation, which assumed the role of Managing Member of the Company.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the Units.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).

1394922_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P18_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowances for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, operating and direct financing lease receivables, notes receivable and accounts receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company places the majority of its cash deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts with financial institutions that have no less than $10 billion in assets.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P27_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	As the costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P38_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P38_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in the United States.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Company believes that its equipment leasing business operates as one reportable segment because: a) the Company measures profit and loss at the equipment portfolio level as a whole; b) the principal decision makers do not review information based on any operating segment other than the equipment leasing transaction portfolio; c) the Company does not maintain discrete financial information on any specific segment other than its equipment financing operations; d) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around different products and services other than equipment lease financing; and e) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around geographic areas.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company sought leasing opportunities were North America and Europe.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, 100% of the Company s operating revenues and long-lived assets are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Based upon the Company s review of its portfolio, no fair value adjustment was deemed necessary at December 31, 2013 and 2012.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried at an estimated fair value on the balance sheet at the end of the period, as determined by the Managing Member.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	At December 31, 2013, the Company s portfolio of warrants had an estimated fair value of $555 thousand.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	At December 31, 2012, the Managing Member estimated the fair value of the warrants to be nominal in amount.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company records prepayments on operating leases as a liability under the caption of unearned operating lease income.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	The liability is recorded when prepayments are received and recognized as operating lease revenue over the period to which the prepayments relate using a straight-line method.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Pursuant to the provisions of Section 701 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is not subject to federal income taxes.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided current franchise income taxes for only those states which levy income taxes on partnerships.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P47_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the related provision for state income taxes was approximately $4 thousand and $16 thousand, respectively.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P47_S4	The Company does not have any entity level uncertain tax positions.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions and is generally subject to examination by U.S. federal (or state and local) income tax authorities for three years from the filing of a tax return.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based upon their aging and historical charge off and collection experience and the creditworthiness of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Accounts receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P72_S3	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P72_S4	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	The asset underlying a direct financing lease contract is considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its net book value.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P80_S2	If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	Substandard Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P117_S3	When a program no longer has a need for short-term financing provided by the Warehousing Facility, it is removed from participation, and as new leasing investment entities are formed by AFS and ALC and commence their acquisition stages, these new entities are added.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the investment program participants were the Company, ATEL 14, LLC and ATEL 15, LLC.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P119_S0	Pursuant to the Warehousing Trust, the benefit of the lease transaction assets, and the corresponding liabilities under the Warehouse Facility, inure to each of such entities based upon each entity s pro-rata share in the Warehousing Trust estate.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P119_S1	The pro-rata share is calculated as a ratio of the net worth of each entity over the aggregate net worth of all entities benefiting from the Warehousing Trust estate, excepting that the trustees, AFS and ALC, are both jointly and severally liable for the pro-rata portion of the obligations of each of the affiliated limited liability companies participating under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P119_S2	Transactions are financed through this Warehouse Facility only until the transactions are allocated to a specific program for purchase or are otherwise disposed by AFS and ALC.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P119_S3	When a determination is made to allocate the transaction to a specific program for purchase by the program, the purchaser repays the debt associated with the asset, either with cash or by means of proceeds of a draw under the Acquisition Facility, and the asset is removed from the Warehouse Facility collateral, and ownership of the asset and any debt obligation associated with the asset are assumed solely by the purchasing entity.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	There were no borrowings under the Warehouse Facility as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had no commitments to purchase lease assets or fund investments in notes receivable.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P122_S1	The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P122_S2	However, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	The Managing Member knows of no facts or circumstances that would make the Company s contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial transactions between businesses.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P123_S1	Accordingly, the Company believes that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice, and that any potential liability under the Company s similar commitments is remote.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P123_S2	Should any such indemnification obligation become payable, the Company would separately record and/or disclose such liability in accordance with GAAP.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	A total of 2,993,482 Units were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P124_S1	The Fund was authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 total Units.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company has the right, exercisable in the Manager s discretion, but not the obligation, to repurchase Units of a Unitholder who ceases to be a U.S. Citizen, for a price equal to 100% of the holder s capital account.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	otherwise permitted, but not required, to repurchase Units upon a holder s request.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P126_S1	The repurchase of Fund Units is made in accordance with Section 13 of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P126_S2	The repurchase would be at the discretion of the Manager on terms it determines to be appropriate under given circumstances, in the event that the Manager deems such repurchase to be in the best interest of the Company; provided, the Company is never required to repurchase any Units.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P126_S3	Upon the repurchase of any Units by the Fund, the tendered Units are cancelled.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P126_S4	Units repurchased in prior periods were repurchased at amounts representing the original investment less cumulative distributions made to the Unitholder with respect to the Units.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P126_S5	All Units repurchased during a quarter are deemed to be repurchased effective the last day of the preceding quarter, and are not deemed to be outstanding during, or entitled to allocations of net income, net loss or distributions for the quarter in which such repurchase occurs.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Fund s net income or net losses are to be allocated 100% to the Members.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P127_S1	From the commencement of the Fund until the initial closing date, as defined in the Company s Operating Agreement, net income and net loss shall be allocated 99% to the Managing Member and 1% to the initial Other Members.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	Fund distributions are to be allocated 7.5% to the Managing Member and 92.5% to the Other Members.

1394922_14_ITEM8_P129_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P129_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_14_ITEM8_P130_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P133_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	At December 31, 2013, only the Company s warrants were measured on a recurring basis.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P134_S1	As of the same date, there were no non-recurring fair value adjustments.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P134_S2	No assets or liabilities required measurement at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2012; however, the Company recorded non-recurring adjustments to reflect the fair values of certain impaired notes receivable during 2012.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P134_S3	Amounts at December 31, 2012 reflect the fair value of the then existing impaired assets.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company s valuation policy is determined by members of the Asset Management, Credit and Accounting departments.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P135_S1	Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P135_S2	Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P135_S3	These techniques are significantly affected by certain of the Company s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P135_S4	Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P137_S1	The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	The measurement methodologies are as follows:
1394922_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value at the end of the period.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P139_S1	The valuation of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_14_ITEM8_P139_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the calculated fair value of the Fund s warrant portfolio approximated $555 thousand.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P140_S0	Such valuation is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P140_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Managing Member estimated the fair value of the warrants to be nominal in amount.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P141_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable, when impairment adjustments are required, is estimated using either third party appraisals or estimations of the value of collateral (for collateral dependent loans) or discounted cash flow analyses (by discounting estimated future cash flows) using the effective interest rate contained in the terms of the original loan.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P141_S1	The Company had no fair value adjustments relative to impaired notes receivable during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P142_S0	During 2012, the Company had recorded fair value adjustments totaling $45 thousand relative to three impaired notes: $18 thousand relative to incremental fair value adjustments recorded during the first quarter of 2012 to further reduce the cost basis of two impaired notes originally deemed impaired in 2011, and an initial fair value of $27 thousand, recorded during the second quarter of 2012, for an additional impaired note.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	All of the fair value adjustments recorded in 2012 were non-recurring and were based upon an estimated valuation of underlying collateral.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P143_S1	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the impaired notes receivable is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	The valuation utilizes a market approach technique and uses inputs from third party appraisers that utilize current market transactions as adjusted for certain factors specific to the underlying collateral.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	The aforementioned impaired notes were settled by November 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P145_S1	There were no impaired notes as of December 31, 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the Company s Level 3 recurring assets (in thousands):

1394922_14_ITEM8_P147_S1	The following table presents the fair value measurement of impaired assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2012 (in thousands):
1394922_14_ITEM8_P148_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s recurring fair value calculation categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2013:
1394922_14_ITEM8_P149_S0	The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P149_S1	Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P150_S0	The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P150_S1	Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P150_S2	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or has realized in a current market exchange.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P150_S3	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is estimated using either third party appraisals of collateral or discounted cash flow analyses based upon current market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, with credit risk or estimated collateral liquidation adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.
1394922_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	The following tables present estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):

1394922_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1394922_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Management of the Managing Member is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) for the Company, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1394922_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The internal control process of the Managing Member, as it is applicable to the Company, was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1394922_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1394922_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1394922_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation.
1394922_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1394922_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1394922_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Based on its assessment, Management of the Managing Member concluded that the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, was effective as of December 31, 2013.

1394922_14_ITEM11_P3_S2	The Company did not incur any additional selling commissions subsequent to December 31, 2009.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Company pays the Manager an Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4% of Operating Revenues, which includes Gross Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P4_S1	The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P4_S2	The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5% of all Company Distributions.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P7_S0	AFS supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees/borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P7_S1	AFS intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P8_S1	While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor's understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states' merit review guidelines.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P8_S2	The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P9_S0	The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. ( NASAA ) is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P9_S1	NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ).
1394922_14_ITEM11_P9_S2	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P9_S3	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P9_S4	The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund's prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ).
1394922_14_ITEM11_P9_S5	Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund's term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager's Carried Interest, as described below.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P10_S1	To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P10_S2	To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P10_S3	Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund's equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P11_S3	Based on the formula in the NASAA Guidelines, the Fund's minimum Investment in Equipment would equal 76.875% of Gross Proceeds (80% [50% .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund's minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_14_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P13_S0	With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5% + 5% = 11.5%), and 7.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5% + 1% = 7.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P13_S1	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P14_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager's Carried Interest.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P14_S1	If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager's Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P14_S2	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P14_S3	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
1394922_14_ITEM11_P15_S0	See Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.
1394922_14_ITEM12_P0_S0	At December 31, 2013, no investor is known to hold beneficially more than 5% of the issued and outstanding Units.

1394922_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	High quality corporate credits are lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or are public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, will consist of real estate investments.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	The Company s objective is to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	During 2014 and 2013, certain lessees and/or financial borrowers generated significant portions (defined as greater than or equal to 10%) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues, excluding gains or losses on disposition of assets, as follows:
1394922_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments owned at any time during the reinvestment period; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30 million); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities are North America and Europe.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Currently, 100% of the Company s operating revenues are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company has no full time employees.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company has acquired a diversified portfolio of equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	The equipment has been leased to lessees in various industries.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	The following tables set forth the types of equipment acquired by the Company through December 31, 2014 and the industries to which the assets have been leased (dollars in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	From inception to December 31, 2014, the Company has disposed of certain leased assets as set forth below (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	For further information regarding the Company s equipment lease portfolio as of December 31, 2014, see Note 6 to the financial statements, Investments in equipment and leases, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company finances assets in diverse industries.
1394922_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	The following tables set forth the types of assets financed by the Company through December 31, 2014 and the industries to which the assets have been financed (dollars in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	From inception to December 31, 2014, assets financed by the Company that are associated with terminated loans are as follows (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	For further information regarding the Company s notes receivable portfolio as of December 31, 2014, see Note 4 to the financial statements, Notes receivable, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company does not own or lease any real property, plant or material physical properties other than the equipment held for lease as set forth in Item 1, Business.
1394922_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2014, a total of 906 investors were Unitholders of record in the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	As noted above, there is no public market for Units and, in order to preserve the Company s status for federal income tax purposes, the Company will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	Nevertheless, in order to provide an estimated per Unit value for those Unitholders who seek valuation information, AFS has calculated an estimated value per Unit as of December 31, 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	AFS estimates the Company s per unit value by estimating the aggregate net asset value of the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The valuation does not take into account any future business activity of the Company; rather it is a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as any current assets and liabilities, as well as for any investment in securities, were assumed to equal their respective reported balances, which management believes approximate their respective fair values, as adjusted for impairment.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	And when applicable, the same was applied to loans incurred under the receivables funding program and the acquisition facility since they also bear variable rates of interest.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	A discounted cash flow approach was used to estimate the values of notes receivable, investments in leases and non-recourse debt.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P6_S1	Under such approach, the value of a financial instrument was estimated by calculating the present value of the instrument s expected cash flows.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P6_S2	The present value was determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by discount rates as deemed appropriate by the Manager.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P6_S3	In most cases, the discount rates used were based on U.S. Treasury yields reported as of the reporting date, plus a spread to account for the credit risk difference between the instrument being valued and Treasury securities.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	The valuation of the Company s warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	After calculating the aggregate estimated net asset value of the Company, AFS then calculated the portion of the aggregate estimated value that would be distributed to Unitholders on liquidation of the Company, and divided the total that would be distributable by the number of outstanding Units as of the December 31, 2014 valuation date.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P8_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the value of the Company s assets, calculated on this basis, was approximately $4.83 per Unit.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P9_S0	The aforementioned valuation was performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated liquidation value per Unit for those Unitholders who seek valuation information.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P9_S1	It is important to note again that there is no market for the Units, and, accordingly, this value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unitholder would receive if he were to seek to sell his Units.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P10_S0	The Company will liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and investment cycle.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P10_S1	Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to when the Company will be fully liquidated, the amount the Company may actually receive if and when it seeks to liquidate its assets, the amount of lease payments and equipment disposition proceeds the Company will actually receive over the remaining term of the Company, or the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unitholders over the course of the Company s remaining term.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P11_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P12_S0	The Managing Member has sole discretion in determining the amount of distributions; provided, however, that the Managing Member will not cause the Company to reinvest operating revenues in equipment, but will distribute available cash, subject to payment of any obligations of the Company, (i) in an amount sufficient to allow an investor in a 31% federal income tax bracket to meet the federal and state income taxes due on income from the operations of the Fund; (ii) through the first full fiscal quarter ending at least six months after termination of the offering of Units, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) a rate of return on their original capital contribution equal to 2.5% over the average yield on five-year United States Treasury Bonds for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of distribution, as published in a national financial newspaper from time to time (with a minimum of 8% per annum and a maximum of 9% per annum), or (b) 90% of the total amount of cash available for distributions; and (iii) for each quarter during the rest of the reinvestment period, an amount equal to 9% per annum on their original capital contribution.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P13_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions in February 2008.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P13_S1	The rate for monthly distributions from 2014 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P13_S2	Likewise the rate for monthly distributions from 2013 operations was $0.075 per Unit for the period from January through December 2013.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P13_S3	The rate for each of the quarterly distributions paid in 2014 and 2013 was $0.225 per Unit.
1394922_15_ITEM5_P14_S0	The following table presents summarized information regarding distributions to Other Members:
1394922_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	A smaller reporting company is not required to present selected financial data in accordance with item 301(c) of Regulation S-K.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Statements contained in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) is a California limited liability company that was formed in January 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ), primarily in the United States.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	As of September 25, 2009, the offering was terminated.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2009, the Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Subsequently, during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company has utilized its credit facilities and reinvested cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the Other Members to acquire additional equipment and/or to fund financing transactions.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ends December 31, 2015, the Company anticipates continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement ( Operating Agreement ), as amended.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were concentrations (greater than or equal to 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financed for borrowers in certain industries as follows:
1394922_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	As previously mentioned, certain lessees and/or financial borrowers generated significant portions (defined as greater than or equal to 10%) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues, excluding gains or losses on disposition of assets, during 2014 and 2013 as follows:
1394922_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods due to anticipated changes in the mix of investments and/or lessees as a result of normal business activities.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment; as such, utilization rates may tend to decrease during the liquidation stage of the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	All of the Company s leased property was acquired during the period from 2008 to 2013.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 93% and 99% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company had net income of $894 thousand and $992 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Results for 2014 reflect decreases in both total revenues and total expenses when compared to prior year.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total revenues for 2014 decreased by $589 thousand, or 12%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The net decrease in total revenues was largely attributable to an unrealized loss on fair valuation of warrants and decreases in operating lease revenues and other revenue offset, in part, by an increase in gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2014, the Company recorded $162 thousand of unrealized losses on fair valuation of warrants as compared to $555 thousand of unrealized gains during the prior year.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The unrealized losses for the current year reduced the fair value of the Company s portfolio of warrants from $555 thousand at December 31, 2013 to $393 thousand at December 31, 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	Such change in market value was attributable to the required periodic revaluation of the warrants in the Company s portfolio of investments.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	In this regard, the majority of the decline in fair market value is related to the price of one portfolio company subsequent to its initial public offering.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	Operating lease revenues decreased by $496 thousand primarily due to run-off and sales of lease assets; and, other revenue declined by $78 thousand due to reductions in deferred maintenance fees and late fees charged to certain lessees.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Partly offsetting the aforementioned decreases in revenue was a $715 thousand increase in gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Such increase was largely attributable to a $407 thousand gain realized on the sale of two drill rigs associated with a terminated lease during the current year, and a change in the mix of assets sold.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Total expenses for 2014 decreased by $491 thousand, or 13%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease was largely attributable to reductions in depreciation and acquisition expenses, cost reimbursements to AFS and interest expense offset, in part, by impairment losses recorded during the current year and an increase in the provision for credit losses.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	The reduction in depreciation expense totaled $498 thousand and was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Acquisition expense declined by $115 thousand due to a lower level of spending related to identifying potential lease and funding transactions.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Cost reimbursements to AFS declined by $58 thousand due to lower costs allocated by the Manager based on the Company s declining asset base; and, interest expense decreased by $53 thousand as a result of a $2.1 million reduction in borrowings since December 31, 2013.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The aforementioned decreases in expenses were partially offset by $226 thousand of impairment losses recognized during 2014, and a $53 thousand increase in the provision for credit losses.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The impairment losses in 2014 were related to the reduction of the cost basis of certain off-lease research equipment deemed impaired.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	There were no such impairments during the prior year.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Finally, the increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to a reduction in recovery of accounts receivable amounts previously reserved.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.3 million and $857 thousand, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The primary source of liquidity for the Company has been its cash flow from fixed-term leasing activities.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	As the lease terms expire, the Company will re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	The future liquidity beyond the contractual minimum rentals will depend on the Company s success in remarketing or selling the equipment as it comes off rental.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Throughout the Reinvestment Period (as defined in the Operating Agreement), the Company anticipates reinvesting a portion of lease payments from assets owned, and/or payments received on notes receivable, in new leasing or financing transactions.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Such reinvestment will occur only after the payment of all obligations, including debt service (both principal and interest), the payment of management fees to the Manager and providing for cash distributions to the Members.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	If inflation in the general economy becomes significant, it may affect the Company in as much as the residual (resale) values and rates on re-leases of the Company s leased assets may increase as the costs of similar assets increase.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, the Company s revenues from existing leases and notes would not increase as such rates are generally fixed for the terms of the leases and notes without adjustment for inflation.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	In addition, if interest rates increase significantly under such circumstances, the rates that the Company can obtain on future lease or financing transactions will be expected to increase as the cost of capital is a significant factor in the pricing of leases and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	Leases and notes already in place, for the most part, would not be affected by changes in interest rates.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	During 2014 and 2013, the Company s primary sources of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating and direct financing lease contracts, and its investments in notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Moreover, the Company realized $3.0 million and $689 thousand of proceeds from the sales of lease assets and/or the early termination of notes receivable, and utilized borrowings totaling $197 thousand and $2.7 million during the respective years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	During the same respective periods, cash was primarily used to pay distributions to both Other Members and the Managing Member and pay down debt.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Total distributions paid to Members amounted to $2.9 million for each of 2014 and 2013; while cash used to pay down debt totaled $2.3 million and $2.2 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	During 2013, cash was also used to fund $905 thousand of investments in notes receivable and to purchase $895 thousand of equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	There was no such funding or purchase activity during the current year.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company participates with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility (the Acquisition Facility ) and a warehouse facility (the Warehouse Facility ) to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate, with a syndicate of financial institutions.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Credit Facility was for an amount up to $60 million and set to expire in June 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	During January 2014, the line was increased to $75 million and expiration extended to June 2015.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	During the first quarter of 2015, the Company was removed as a participant of the Credit Facility.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Credit Facility includes certain financial and non-financial covenants applicable to each borrower, including the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Such covenants include covenants typically found in credit facilities of the size and nature of the Credit Facility, such as accuracy of representations, good standing, absence of liens and material litigation, etc.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company considers certain financial covenants to be material to its ongoing use of the Credit Facility and these covenants are described below.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain a specific tangible net worth, to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and to comply with other terms expressed in the Credit Facility, including limitation on the incurrence of additional debt and guaranties, defaults, and delinquencies.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The material financial covenants are summarized as follows:
1394922_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	EBITDA is defined under the Credit Facility as, for the relevant period of time (1) gross revenues (all payments from leases and notes receivable) for such period minus (2) expenses deducted in determining net income for such period plus (3) to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period (a) provision for income taxes and (b) interest expense, and (c) depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Extraordinary items and gains or losses on (and proceeds from) sales or dispositions of assets outside of the ordinary course of business are excluded in the calculation of EBITDA.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Tangible Net Worth is defined as, as of the date of determination, (i) the net worth of the Company, after deducting therefrom (without duplication of deductions) the net book amount of all assets of the Company, after deducting any reserves and other amounts for assets which would be treated as intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and after certain other adjustments permitted under the agreements.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The financial covenants referred to above are applicable to the Company only to the extent that the Company has borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company was in compliance with each of these financial covenants with a minimum Tangible Net Worth, leverage ratio and (EBITDA) interest coverage ratio, as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement of $7.6 million, 0.25 to 1, and 67.86 to 1, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	As such, as of December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all such material financial covenants.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	For purposes of compliance with the Credit Facility covenants, the Company uses a financial calculation of EBITDA, as defined therein, which is a non-GAAP financial performance measure.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	The EBITDA is utilized by the Company to calculate its debt covenant ratios.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, as defined in the loan agreement, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The terms of the Credit Facility include standard events of default by the Company which, if not cured within applicable grace periods, could give lenders remedies against the Company, including the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings and a demand for repayment in advance of their stated maturity.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	If a breach of any material term of the Credit Facility should occur, the lenders may, at their option, increase borrowing rates, accelerate the obligations in advance of their stated maturities, terminate the facility, and exercise rights of collection available to them under the express terms of the facility, or by operation of law.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	The lenders also retain the discretion to waive a violation of any covenant at the Company s request.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company is currently in compliance with its obligations under the Credit Facility.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	In the event of a technical default (e.g., the failure to timely file a required report, or a one-time breach of a financial covenant), the Company believes it has ample time to request and be granted a waiver by the lenders, or, alternatively, cure the default under the existing provisions of its debt agreements, including, if necessary, arranging for additional capital from alternate sources to satisfy outstanding obligations.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The lending syndicate providing the Credit Facility has a blanket lien on all of the Company s assets as collateral for any and all borrowings under the Acquisition Facility, and on a pro-rata basis under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Acquisition Facility is generally recourse solely to the Company, and is not cross-defaulted to any other obligations of affiliated companies under the Credit Facility, except as described in this paragraph.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The Credit Facility is cross-defaulted to a default in the payment of any debt (other than non-recourse debt) or any other agreement or condition beyond the period of grace (not exceeding 30 days), the effect of which would entitle the lender under such agreement to accelerate the obligations prior to their stated maturity in an individual or aggregate principal amount in excess of 15% of the Company s consolidated Tangible Net Worth.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	Also, a bankruptcy of AFS will trigger a default for the Company under the Credit Facility.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling $1.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The notes are secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	For detailed information on the Company s debt obligations, see Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions, based on cash flows from operations, beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Such distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had no commitments to purchase lease assets or fund investments in notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	The Company evaluated the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and has determined that such impact is virtually non-existent as the new revenue guideline does not affect revenues from leases and loans, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014 15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The new standard provides guidance relative to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management of the Company to be critical to an understanding of the Company s financial statements because their application requires significantly complex or subjective judgments, decisions, or assessments, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Company also states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	Depreciation is being recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	The Company depreciates all lease assets, in accordance with guidelines consistent with ASC 840-20-35-3, over the periods of the lease terms contained in each asset s respective lease contract to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	All lease assets are purchased only concurrent with the execution of a lease commitment by the lessee.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P49_S5	Thus, the original depreciation period corresponds with the term of the original lease.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Once the term of an original lease contract is completed, the subject property is typically sold to the existing user, re-leased to the existing user, or, when off-lease, is held for sale.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Assets classified as held-for-sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount, or the fair value less cost to sell (ASC 360-10-35-43).
1394922_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company does not use the equipment held in its portfolio, but holds it solely for lease and ultimate sale.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	In the course of marketing equipment that has come off-lease, management may determine at some point that re-leasing the assets may provide a superior return for investors and would then execute another lease.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Upon entering into a new lease contract, management will estimate the residual value once again and resume depreciation.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	If, and when, the Company, at any time, determines that depreciation in value may have occurred with respect to an asset held-for-sale, the Company would review the value to determine whether a material reduction in value had occurred and recognize any appropriate impairment.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	All lease assets, including off-lease assets, are subject to the Company s quarterly impairment analysis, as described below.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	In addition, the company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P57_S5	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P57_S6	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P62_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P65_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P66_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual contract term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P68_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the assets and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	See the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements attached hereto at pages 15 through 38 .
1394922_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ATEL 12, LLC (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of income, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Management of the Company s Managing Member.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1394922_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ATEL 12, LLC as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Company s Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, LLC ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability corporation.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P6_S2	Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial Services, LLC ( AFS ) (the Managing Member or Manager ), a California limited liability corporation, which assumed the role of Managing Member of the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P6_S3	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P8_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	As of December 31, 2014, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and/or redemptions, totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received and 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the Units.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the Reinvestment Period (ending six calendar years after the completion of the Company s public offering of Units) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of income, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	These reclassifications had no significant effect on the reported financial position or results of operations.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after December 31, 2014, up until the issuance of the financial statements.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	No events were noted which would require disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowances for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, operating and direct financing lease receivables, notes receivable and accounts receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company places the majority of its cash deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts with financial institutions that have no less than $10 billion in assets.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	Such deposits are insured up to $250 thousand.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P21_S3	The remainder of the Funds cash is temporarily invested in U.S. Treasury denominated instruments.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P21_S4	The concentration of such deposits and temporary cash investments is not deemed to create a significant risk to the Company.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Accounts and notes receivable represent amounts due from lessees or borrowers in various industries, related to equipment on operating and direct financing leases or notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Depreciation is being recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company depreciates all lease assets, in accordance with guidelines consistent with ASC 840-20-35-3, over the periods of the lease terms contained in each asset s respective lease contract to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P24_S4	All lease assets are purchased only concurrent with the execution of a lease commitment by the lessee.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P24_S5	Thus, the original depreciation period corresponds with the term of the original lease.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Once the term of an original lease contract is completed, the subject property is typically sold to the existing user, re-leased to the existing user, or, when off-lease, is held for sale.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	Assets which are re-leased continue to be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Assets classified as held-for-sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount, or the fair value less cost to sell (ASC 360-10-35-43).
1394922_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company does not use the equipment held in its portfolio, but holds it solely for lease and ultimate sale.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	In the course of marketing equipment that has come off-lease, management may determine at some point that re-leasing the assets may provide a superior return for investors and would then execute another lease.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	Upon entering into a new lease contract, management will estimate the residual value once again and resume depreciation.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	If, and when, the Company, at any time, determines that depreciation in value may have occurred with respect to an asset held-for-sale, the Company would review the value to determine whether a material reduction in value had occurred and recognize any appropriate impairment.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	All lease assets, including off-lease assets, are subject to the Company s quarterly impairment analysis, as described below.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P28_S3	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P30_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	In addition, the company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P31_S4	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P31_S5	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P31_S6	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P36_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P36_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P38_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P39_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P39_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P39_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P40_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P40_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual lease term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P41_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P41_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection and acquisition of equipment which are reimbursable to the Managing Member under the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	As the costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P43_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P43_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in the United States.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company s principal decision makers are the Managing Member s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Company believes that its equipment leasing business operates as one reportable segment because: a) the Company measures profit and loss at the equipment portfolio level as a whole; b) the principal decision makers do not review information based on any operating segment other than the equipment leasing transaction portfolio; c) the Company does not maintain discrete financial information on any specific segment other than its equipment financing operations; d) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around different products and services other than equipment lease financing; and e) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around geographic areas.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company sought leasing opportunities were North America and Europe.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, 100% of the Company s operating revenues and long-lived assets are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Based upon the Company s review of its portfolio, no fair value adjustment was deemed necessary for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	Purchased securities totaled $258 thousand and $275 thousand at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P49_S3	Gains recognized on sales or dispositions of investment securities totaled $14 thousand and $5 thousand for the respective years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are reflected at an estimated fair value on the balance sheet at the end of the period, as determined by the Managing Member.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	During 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded unrealized losses of $162 thousand and unrealized gains of $555 thousand, respectively, on fair valuation of its warrants.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company s portfolio of warrants had an estimated fair value of $393 thousand and $555 thousand, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	During 2014, the Company realized gains of $16 thousand on the net exercise of certain warrants.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P50_S4	There were no net exercises of warrants during prior year.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company records prepayments on operating leases as a liability under the caption of unearned operating lease income.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	The liability is recorded when prepayments are received and recognized as operating lease revenue over the period to which the prepayments relate using a straight-line method.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Pursuant to the provisions of Section 701 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is not subject to federal income taxes.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided current franchise income taxes for only those states which levy income taxes on partnerships.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the related provision for state income taxes was approximately $1 thousand and $4 thousand, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P52_S4	The Company does not have any entity level uncertain tax positions.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions and is generally subject to examination by U.S. federal (or state and local) income tax authorities for three years from the filing of a tax return.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The tax bases of the Company s net assets and liabilities vary from the amounts presented in these financial statements at December 31, 2014 and 2013 as follows (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The primary differences between the tax bases of net assets and the amounts recorded in the financial statements are the result of differences in accounting for impairment losses, syndication costs and differences between the depreciation methods used in the financial statements and the Company s tax returns.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	The following reconciles the net income reported in these financial statements to the income reported on the Company s federal tax return (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Net income and distributions per Unit are based upon the weighted average number of Other Members Units outstanding during the year.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P58_S3	The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P58_S4	The Company evaluated the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and has determined that such impact is virtually non-existent as the new revenue guideline does not affect revenues from leases and loans, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014 15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The new standard provides guidance relative to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Concentration of credit risk and major customers:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company leases equipment to lessees and provides debt financing to borrowers in diversified industries.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Leases and notes receivable are subject to the Managing Member s credit committee review.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	The leases and notes receivable provide for the return of the equipment to the Company upon default.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were concentrations (greater than or equal to 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financed for borrowers in certain industries as follows:

1394922_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based upon their aging and historical charge off and collection experience and the creditworthiness of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Accounts receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with lease or note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	Based upon management s judgment, such leases or notes may be placed in non-accrual status.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P71_S3	Leases or notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P71_S4	Until such time, revenues on operating leases are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P71_S5	All payments received on amounts billed under direct financing leases contracts and notes receivable are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	In addition to the allowance established for delinquent accounts receivable, the total allowance related solely to financing receivables also includes anticipated impairment charges on notes receivable and direct financing leases.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	The asset underlying a direct financing lease contract is considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its net book value.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P75_S2	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P75_S3	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Any traditional corporate type account with potential weaknesses (e.g. large net losses or major industry downturns) or, any growth capital account that has less than three months of cash as of the end of the calendar quarter to fund their continuing operations.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	These accounts deserve management s close attention.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Substandard Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Accounts that are so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Fund will sustain some loss as the likelihood of fully collecting all receivables may be questionable if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	Such accounts are on the Manager s Credit Watch List.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	Doubtful Any account where the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	Accordingly, an account that is so classified is on the Manager s Credit Watch List, and has been declared in default and the Manager has repossessed, or is attempting to repossess, the equipment it financed.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	This category includes impaired notes and leases as applicable.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P89_S3	As of December 31, 2013, there were no investments in financing receivables with related accounts receivable past due more than 90 days which were still on an accrual basis.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	In addition, the company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P92_S3	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P92_S4	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P92_S5	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P92_S6	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	As a result of these reviews, the Company recorded fair value adjustments of $226 thousand during 2014 to reduce the cost basis of certain impaired off-lease equipment.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P120_S1	The Warehousing Trust is used by the Warehouse Facility borrowers to acquire and hold, on a short-term basis, certain lease transactions that meet the investment objectives of each of such entities.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P120_S2	Each of the leasing programs sponsored by AFS and ALC is a pro rata participant in the Warehousing Trust, as described below.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P120_S3	When a program no longer has a need for short-term financing provided by the Warehousing Facility, it is removed from participation, and as new leasing investment entities are formed by AFS and ALC and commence their acquisition stages, these new entities are added.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Pursuant to the Warehousing Trust, the benefit of the lease transaction assets, and the corresponding liabilities under the Warehouse Facility, inure to each of such entities based upon each entity s pro-rata share in the Warehousing Trust estate.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	The pro-rata share is calculated as a ratio of the net worth of each entity over the aggregate net worth of all entities benefiting from the Warehousing Trust estate, excepting that the trustees, AFS and ALC, are both jointly and severally liable for the pro-rata portion of the obligations of each of the affiliated limited liability companies participating under the Warehouse Facility.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P122_S2	Transactions are financed through this Warehouse Facility only until the transactions are allocated to a specific program for purchase or are otherwise disposed by AFS and ALC.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P122_S3	When a determination is made to allocate the transaction to a specific program for purchase by the program, the purchaser repays the debt associated with the asset, either with cash or by means of proceeds of a draw under the Acquisition Facility, and the asset is removed from the Warehouse Facility collateral, and ownership of the asset and any debt obligation associated with the asset are assumed solely by the purchasing entity.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	There were no borrowings under the Warehouse Facility as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P125_S1	The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P125_S2	However, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	The Managing Member knows of no facts or circumstances that would make the Company s contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial transactions between businesses.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	Accordingly, the Company believes that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice, and that any potential liability under the Company s similar commitments is remote.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P126_S2	Should any such indemnification obligation become payable, the Company would separately record and/or disclose such liability in accordance with GAAP.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	A total of 2,992,482 and 2,993,482 Units were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P128_S2	The repurchase of Fund Units is made in accordance with Section 13 of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P128_S3	The repurchase would be at the discretion of the Manager on terms it determines to be appropriate under given circumstances, in the event that the Manager deems such repurchase to be in the best interest of the Company; provided, the Company is never required to repurchase any Units.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P128_S4	Upon the repurchase of any Units by the Fund, the tendered Units are cancelled.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P128_S5	Units repurchased in prior periods were repurchased at amounts representing the original investment less cumulative distributions made to the Unitholder with respect to the Units.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P128_S6	All Units repurchased during a quarter are deemed to be repurchased effective the last day of the preceding quarter, and are not deemed to be outstanding during, or entitled to allocations of net income, net loss or distributions for the quarter in which such repurchase occurs.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	The Fund s net income or net losses are to be allocated 100% to the Members.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P129_S1	From the commencement of the Fund until the initial closing date, as defined in the Company s Operating Agreement, net income and net loss shall be allocated 99% to the Managing Member and 1% to the initial Other Members.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	Fund distributions are to be allocated 7.5% to the Managing Member and 92.5% to the Other Members.

1394922_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P131_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P135_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, only the Company s warrants were measured on a recurring basis.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P136_S1	In addition, during 2014, the Company recorded non-recurring adjustments to reflect the fair values of certain impaired off-leased assets.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P136_S2	There were no such adjustments recorded during 2013.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P136_S3	Amounts at December 31, 2014 reflect the fair value of the then existing impaired assets.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Company s valuation policy is determined by members of the Asset Management, Credit and Accounting departments.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P137_S1	Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P137_S2	Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P137_S3	These techniques are significantly affected by certain of the Company s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P137_S4	Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P138_S1	Such analysis is performed by asset management and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P138_S2	The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	The fair value adjustments utilized the following methodology:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value at the end of the period.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	The valuation of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_15_ITEM8_P140_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the calculated fair value of the Fund s warrant portfolio approximated $393 thousand and $555 thousand, respectively.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	Such valuation is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the Company s Level 3 recurring assets (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	During 2014, the Company deemed certain off-lease equipment to be impaired and recorded fair value adjustments of $226 thousand to reduce the cost basis of the impaired equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P143_S1	No such adjustments were recorded during the prior year.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	The fair value adjustments recorded during the year of 2014 were non-recurring.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of impaired lease assets were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy as the data sources utilized for the valuation of such assets reflect significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	Such valuation utilizes a market approach technique and uses inputs that reflect the sales price of similar assets sold by affiliates and/or information from third party remarketing agents not readily available in the market.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	The following table presents the fair value measurement of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s recurring fair value calculation categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2014 and 2013:
1394922_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P148_S1	Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P149_S1	Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P149_S2	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or has realized in a current market exchange.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P149_S3	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is generally estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market valuation techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.
1394922_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following tables present estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company s Managing Member s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer ( Management ), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, Management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company does not control the financial reporting process, and is solely dependent on the Management of the Managing Member, who is responsible for providing the Company with financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Management of the Managing Member is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) for the Company, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The internal control process of the Managing Member, as it is applicable to the Company, was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management of the Managing Member assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, as of December 31, 2014.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Based on its assessment, Management of the Managing Member concluded that the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, was effective as of December 31, 2014.

1394922_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which exempts non-accelerated filers from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
1394922_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.

1394922_15_ITEM11_P3_S2	The Company did not incur any additional selling commissions subsequent to December 31, 2009.

1394922_15_ITEM11_P4_S2	The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5% of all Company Distributions.

1394922_15_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P8_S1	While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor s understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P8_S2	The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P9_S0	The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. ( NASAA ) is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P9_S1	NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ).
1394922_15_ITEM11_P9_S2	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P9_S3	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P9_S4	The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund s prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ).
1394922_15_ITEM11_P9_S5	Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund s term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager s Carried Interest, as described below.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P10_S1	To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P10_S2	To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P10_S3	Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P11_S3	Based on the formula in the NASAA Guidelines, the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would equal 76.875% of Gross Proceeds (80% [50% x .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_15_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P13_S0	With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5% + 5% = 11.5%), and 7.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5% + 1% = 7.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P13_S1	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P14_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P14_S1	If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P14_S2	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P14_S3	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
1394922_15_ITEM11_P15_S0	See Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.

1394922_15_ITEM15_P8_S0	Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the course of business of the Company, this Code of Ethics serves only as a rough guide.
1394922_15_ITEM15_P8_S1	Confronted with ethically ambiguous situations, the Covered Officers should remember the Company s commitment to the highest ethical standards and seek independent advice, where necessary, to ensure that all actions they take on behalf of the Company honor this commitment.

1394922_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Company s Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, LLC ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability corporation.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial Services, LLC ( AFS ) (the Managing Member or Manager ), a California limited liability corporation, which assumed the role of Managing Member of the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2015, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial member s capital investment) have been received and 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the Units.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	On January 1, 2016, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Prior thereto, the Company was in its acquisition phase and was making distributions on a monthly and quarterly basis.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	During the liquidation phase, periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company has acquired and intends to acquire various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and to make loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as materials handling equipment, manufacturing equipment, mining equipment, and transportation equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	A portion of the portfolio will include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	The Company will also seek investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company only purchases equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease will be entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Through December 31, 2015, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of $28.6 million.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	The Company had also loaned $5.4 million for notes receivable secured by various assets.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company s objective is to have at least 60% of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	High quality corporate credits are lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or are public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio may include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, will consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, will consist of real estate investments.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P11_S4	The Company s objective is to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2015 and 2014, certain lessees and/or financial borrowers generated significant portions (defined as greater than or equal to 10%) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues, excluding gains or losses on disposition of assets, as follows:
1394922_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments owned at any time during the reinvestment period; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30 million); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities are North America and Europe.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Currently, 100% of the Company s operating revenues are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company has no full time employees.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company has acquired a diversified portfolio of equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	The equipment has been leased to lessees in various industries.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	The following tables set forth the types of equipment acquired by the Company through December 31, 2015 and the industries to which the assets have been leased (dollars in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	From inception to December 31, 2015, the Company has disposed of certain leased assets as set forth below (in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	For further information regarding the Company s equipment lease portfolio as of December 31, 2015, see Note 6 to the financial statements, Investments in equipment and leases, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Company finances assets in diverse industries.
1394922_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	The following tables set forth the types of assets financed by the Company through December 31, 2015 and the industries to which the assets have been financed (dollars in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	From inception to December 31, 2015, assets financed by the Company that are associated with terminated loans are as follows (in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	For further information regarding the Company s notes receivable portfolio as of December 31, 2015, see Note 4 to the financial statements, Notes receivable, net, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company does not own or lease any real property, plant or material physical properties other than the equipment held for lease as set forth in Item 1, Business.
1394922_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2015, a total of 908 investors were Unitholders of record in the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As noted above, there is no public market for Units and, in order to preserve the Company s status for federal income tax purposes, the Company will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Nevertheless, in order to provide an estimated per Unit value for those Unitholders who seek valuation information, AFS has calculated an estimated value per Unit as of December 31, 2015.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	AFS estimates the Company s per unit value by estimating the aggregate net asset value of the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	The valuation does not take into account any future business activity of the Company; rather it is a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as any current assets and liabilities, as well as for any investment in securities, were assumed to equal their respective reported balances, which management believes approximate their respective fair values, as adjusted for impairment.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	And when applicable, the same was applied to loans incurred under the receivables funding program and the acquisition facility since they also bear variable rates of interest.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	A discounted cash flow approach was used to estimate the values of notes receivable, investments in leases and non-recourse debt.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	Under such approach, the value of a financial instrument was estimated by calculating the present value of the instrument s expected cash flows.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P6_S2	The present value was determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by discount rates as deemed appropriate by the Manager.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P6_S3	In most cases, the discount rates used were based on U.S. Treasury yields reported as of the reporting date, plus a spread to account for the credit risk difference between the instrument being valued and Treasury securities.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The valuation of the Company s warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	After calculating the aggregate estimated net asset value of the Company, AFS then calculated the portion of the aggregate estimated value that would be distributed to Unitholders on liquidation of the Company, and divided the total that would be distributable by the number of outstanding Units as of the December 31, 2015 valuation date.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P8_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the value of the Company s assets, calculated on this basis, was approximately $3.00 per Unit.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P9_S0	The aforementioned valuation was performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated liquidation value per Unit for those Unitholders who seek valuation information.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P9_S1	It is important to note again that there is no market for the Units, and, accordingly, this value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unitholder would receive if he were to seek to sell his Units.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P10_S0	The Company will liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and investment cycle.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P10_S1	Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to when the Company will be fully liquidated, the amount the Company may actually receive if and when it seeks to liquidate its assets, the amount of lease payments and equipment disposition proceeds the Company will actually receive over the remaining term of the Company, or the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unitholders over the course of the Company s remaining term.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P11_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P12_S0	The Managing Member has sole discretion in determining the amount of distributions; provided, however, that the Managing Member will not cause the Company to reinvest operating revenues in equipment, but will distribute available cash, subject to payment of any obligations of the Company, (i) in an amount sufficient to allow an investor in a 31% federal income tax bracket to meet the federal and state income taxes due on income from the operations of the Fund; (ii) through the first full fiscal quarter ending at least six months after termination of the offering of Units, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) a rate of return on their original capital contribution equal to 2.5% over the average yield on five-year United States Treasury Bonds for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of distribution, as published in a national financial newspaper from time to time (with a minimum of 8% per annum and a maximum of 9% per annum), or (b) 90% of the total amount of cash available for distributions; and (iii) for each quarter during the rest of the reinvestment period, an amount equal to 9% per annum on their original capital contribution.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P13_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions in February 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P13_S1	The rate for monthly distributions paid in 2015 and 2014 was $0.075 per Unit.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P13_S2	The rate for each of the quarterly distributions paid in 2015 and 2014 was $0.225 per Unit.
1394922_16_ITEM5_P14_S0	The following table presents summarized information regarding distributions to Other Members:
1394922_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	A smaller reporting company is not required to present selected financial data in accordance with item 301(c) of Regulation S-K.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Statements contained in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K.

1394922_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) is a California limited liability company that was formed in January 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ), primarily in the United States.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	As of September 25, 2009, the offering was terminated.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2009, the Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Subsequently, during the reinvestment period ( Reinvestment Period ) (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company has utilized its credit facilities and reinvested cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the Other Members to acquire additional equipment and/or to fund financing transactions.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ends December 31, 2015, the Company anticipates continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement ( Operating Agreement ), as amended.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	However, pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities on January 1, 2016.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were concentrations (greater than or equal to 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financed for borrowers in certain industries as follows:
1394922_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	As previously mentioned, certain lessees and/or financial borrowers generated significant portions (defined as greater than or equal to 10%) of the Company s total leasing and lending revenues, excluding gains or losses on disposition of assets, during 2015 and 2014 as follows:
1394922_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods due to anticipated changes in the mix of investments and/or lessees as a result of normal business activities.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment; as such, utilization rates may tend to decrease during the liquidation stage of the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	All of the Company s leased property was acquired during the period from 2008 to 2013.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 100% and 93% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company had net income of $988 thousand and $894 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Results for 2015 reflect decreases in both total revenues and total operating expenses when compared to prior year.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Total revenues for 2015 decreased by $1.4 million, or 34%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Such decrease was largely attributable to reductions in operating lease revenues and gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes offset, in part, by an increase in gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The decrease in operating lease revenues totaled $1.1 million and was primarily attributable to run-off and sales of lease assets.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Gains recognized on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes declined by $411 thousand mainly due to a reduction in volume and change in the mix of assets sold, as the Fund sold two drill rigs associated with a terminated lease during the prior year period.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in revenues was a $117 thousand increase in gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Such increase was primarily due to a $147 thousand gain realized on the net exercise of warrants during the current year.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Total operating expenses for 2015 decreased by $1.5 million, or 46%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The decrease was largely attributable to reductions in depreciation expense, impairment losses on equipment, cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member and asset management fees offset, in part, by an increase in taxes on income and franchise fees.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The reduction in depreciation expense totaled $1.1 million and was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Impairment losses on equipment declined by $226 thousand due to fair value adjustments recorded on certain impaired off-lease equipment during the prior year.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	There was no such fair value adjustment during the current year.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	Moreover, cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member were reduced by $87 thousand as a result of lower allocated costs partially based on the Fund s declining asset base; and, asset management fees paid to the Managing Member decreased by $66 thousand as a result of the continued decline in managed assets and related rents.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The aforementioned decreases in expenses were partially offset by a $63 thousand increase in taxes on income and franchise fees.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Such increase was attributable to a higher estimated tax liability based upon a prior year increase in gains on sales of lease assets.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.3 million.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The primary source of liquidity for the Company has been its cash flow from fixed-term leasing activities.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	As the lease terms expire, the Company will re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	The future liquidity beyond the contractual minimum rentals will depend on the Company s success in remarketing or selling the equipment as it comes off rental.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	During 2015 and 2014, the Company s primary sources of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating and direct financing lease contracts, and its investments in notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Moreover, the Company realized $1.5 million and $3.0 million of proceeds from the sales of lease assets and/or the early termination of notes receivable during the respective years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	In addition, during the prior year, the Company utilized borrowings totaling $197 thousand.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	During the same comparative years, cash was primarily used to pay distributions to both the Other Members and the Managing Member and to pay down debt.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Total distributions paid to Members amounted to $2.9 million for each of 2015 and 2014; while cash used to pay down debt totaled $873 thousand and $2.3 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Effective December 30, 2014, the Company s participation in a revolving credit facility with AFS and certain of its affiliates was terminated.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company had no related balances outstanding at the time.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Prior to December 30, 2014, the Company participated with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility and a warehouse facility to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate, with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	The notes are secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	For detailed information on the Company s debt obligations, see Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company commenced periodic distributions, based on cash flows from operations, beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Such distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2015.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had no commitments to purchase lease assets or fund investments in notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and in August 2015, issued Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ).
1394922_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	ASU 2015-14 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P33_S5	The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P33_S6	The Company evaluated the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and has determined that such impact is virtually non-existent as the new revenue guideline does not affect revenues from leases and loans, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU-2014-15 ).
1394922_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	The new standard provides guidance relative to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or related disclosures.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The policies discussed below are considered by management of the Company to be critical to an understanding of the Company s financial statements because their application requires significantly complex or subjective judgments, decisions, or assessments, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Company also states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Depreciation is being recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	The Company depreciates all lease assets, in accordance with guidelines consistent with ASC 840-20-35-3, over the periods of the lease terms contained in each asset s respective lease contract to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	All lease assets are purchased only concurrent with the execution of a lease commitment by the lessee.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P39_S5	Thus, the original depreciation period corresponds with the term of the original lease.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Once the term of an original lease contract is completed, the subject property is typically sold to the existing user, re-leased to the existing user, or, when off-lease, is held for sale.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Assets which are re-leased continue to be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Assets classified as held-for-sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount, or the fair value less cost to sell (ASC 360-10-35-43).
1394922_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company does not use the equipment held in its portfolio, but holds it solely for lease and ultimate sale.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	In the course of marketing equipment that has come off-lease, management may determine at some point that re-leasing the assets may provide a superior return for investors and would then execute another lease.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	Upon entering into a new lease contract, management will estimate the residual value once again and resume depreciation.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	If, and when, the Company, at any time, determines that depreciation in value may have occurred with respect to an asset held-for-sale, the Company would review the value to determine whether a material reduction in value had occurred and recognize any appropriate impairment.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	All lease assets, including off-lease assets, are subject to the Company s quarterly impairment analysis, as described below.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P45_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition, the company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P46_S6	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P54_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P54_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P55_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual contract term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P56_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P57_S4	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the assets and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	See the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements attached hereto at pages 14 through 36 .
1394922_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ATEL 12, LLC (the Company ) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of income, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Management of the Company s Managing Member.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1394922_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ATEL 12, LLC as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:
1394922_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the principal operations ).
1394922_16_ITEM8_P6_S1	From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Company s Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, LLC ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability corporation.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P6_S2	Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial Services, LLC ( AFS ) (the Managing Member or Manager ), a California limited liability corporation, which assumed the role of Managing Member of the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P6_S3	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P8_S1	On January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P8_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions were subject to a separate escrow to be released to the Fund only when the Fund had received aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P9_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	As of December 31, 2015, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and/or redemptions, totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received and 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Fund, or Managing Member and/or affiliates on behalf of the Fund, has incurred costs in connection with the organization, registration and issuance of the Units.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	The amount of such costs to be borne by the Fund is limited by certain provisions of the ATEL 12, LLC Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that (i) preserves, protects and returns the Company s invested capital; (ii) generates regular cash distributions to Unitholders, any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the Reinvestment Period (ending six calendar years after the completion of the Company s public offering of Units) which ends on December 31, 2015 and (iii) provides additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets have been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	On January 1, 2016, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Prior thereto, the Company was in its acquisition phase and was making distributions on a monthly and quarterly basis.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	During the liquidation phase, periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of income, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	These reclassifications had no significant effect on the reported financial position or results of operations.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after December 31, 2015, up until the issuance of the financial statements.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	No events were noted which would require disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowances for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, operating and direct financing lease receivables, notes receivable and accounts receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company places the majority of its cash deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts with financial institutions that have no less than $10 billion in assets.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	Such deposits are insured up to $250 thousand.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	The remainder of the Funds cash is temporarily invested in U.S. Treasury denominated instruments.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	The concentration of such deposits and temporary cash investments is not deemed to create a significant risk to the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Accounts and notes receivable represent amounts due from lessees or borrowers in various industries, related to equipment on operating and direct financing leases or notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Depreciation is being recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company depreciates all lease assets, in accordance with guidelines consistent with ASC 840-20-35-3, over the periods of the lease terms contained in each asset s respective lease contract to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P25_S4	All lease assets are purchased only concurrent with the execution of a lease commitment by the lessee.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P25_S5	Thus, the original depreciation period corresponds with the term of the original lease.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Once the term of an original lease contract is completed, the subject property is typically sold to the existing user, re-leased to the existing user, or, when off-lease, is held for sale.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	Assets which are re-leased continue to be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Assets classified as held-for-sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount, or the fair value less cost to sell (ASC 360-10-35-43).
1394922_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company does not use the equipment held in its portfolio, but holds it solely for lease and ultimate sale.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	In the course of marketing equipment that has come off-lease, management may determine at some point that re-leasing the assets may provide a superior return for investors and would then execute another lease.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	Upon entering into a new lease contract, management will estimate the residual value once again and resume depreciation.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	All lease assets, including off-lease assets, are subject to the Company s quarterly impairment analysis, as described below.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P31_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	In addition, the company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P32_S4	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P32_S5	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P32_S6	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P37_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P37_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P39_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P39_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P40_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P40_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P40_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	Based upon management s judgment, notes may be placed in a non-accrual status.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P41_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P41_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual lease term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease or loan assets, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P42_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection and acquisition of equipment which are reimbursable to the Managing Member under the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	As the costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are periodically reviewed for impairment.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in the United States.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company s principal decision makers are the Managing Member s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Company believes that its equipment leasing business operates as one reportable segment because: a) the Company measures profit and loss at the equipment portfolio level as a whole; b) the principal decision makers do not review information based on any operating segment other than the equipment leasing transaction portfolio; c) the Company does not maintain discrete financial information on any specific segment other than its equipment financing operations; d) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around different products and services other than equipment lease financing; and e) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around geographic areas.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	The primary geographic regions in which the Company sought leasing opportunities were North America and Europe.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 100% of the Company s operating revenues and long-lived assets are from customers domiciled in North America.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	Based upon the Company s review of its portfolio, a fair value adjustment of $6 thousand was recorded during 2015 relative to an impaired investment.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	No such fair value adjustment was deemed necessary for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	Purchased securities totaled $300 thousand and $258 thousand at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P51_S5	There were no sales or dispositions of securities during 2015.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are reflected at an estimated fair value on the balance sheet at the end of the period, as determined by the Managing Member.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	During 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded unrealized losses of $66 thousand and $162 thousand, respectively, on fair valuation of its warrants.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company s portfolio of warrants had an estimated fair value of $327 thousand and $393 thousand, respectively.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company records prepayments on operating leases as a liability under the caption of unearned operating lease income.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The liability is recorded when prepayments are received and recognized as operating lease revenue over the period to which the prepayments relate using a straight-line method.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Pursuant to the provisions of Section 701 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is not subject to federal income taxes.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided current franchise income taxes for only those states which levy income taxes on partnerships.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P54_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the related provision for state income taxes was approximately $64 thousand and $1 thousand, respectively.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions and is generally subject to examination by U.S. federal (or state and local) income tax authorities for three years from the filing of a tax return.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The tax bases of the Company s net assets and liabilities vary from the amounts presented in these financial statements at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as follows (in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The primary differences between the tax bases of net assets and the amounts recorded in the financial statements are the result of differences in accounting for impairment losses, syndication costs and differences between the depreciation methods used in the financial statements and the Company s tax returns.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	The following reconciles the net income reported in these financial statements to the income reported on the Company s federal tax return (unaudited) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Net income and distributions per Unit are based upon the weighted average number of Other Members Units outstanding during the year.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P60_S2	On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and in August 2015, issued Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ).
1394922_16_ITEM8_P60_S3	ASU 2015-14 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P60_S4	Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Company evaluated the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and has determined that such impact is virtually non-existent as the new revenue guideline does not affect revenues from leases and loans, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU-2014-15 ).
1394922_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The new standard provides guidance relative to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or related disclosures.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based upon their aging and historical charge off and collection experience and the creditworthiness of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Accounts receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with lease or note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	Based upon management s judgment, such leases or notes may be placed in non-accrual status.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	Leases or notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P74_S4	Until such time, revenues on operating leases are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P74_S5	All payments received on amounts billed under direct financing leases contracts and notes receivable are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	In addition to the allowance established for delinquent accounts receivable, the total allowance related solely to financing receivables also includes anticipated impairment charges on notes receivable and direct financing leases.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P76_S4	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The asset underlying a direct financing lease contract is considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its net book value.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P77_S3	Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company s allowance for credit losses (related solely to financing receivables) and its recorded investment in financing receivables as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):

1394922_16_ITEM8_P84_S2	If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Substandard Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Accounts that are so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Fund will sustain some loss as the likelihood of fully collecting all receivables may be questionable if the deficiencies are not corrected.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	As of the same respective dates, certain investments in financing receivables with related accounts receivable past due more than 90 days were still on an accrual basis based on management s assessment of the collectability of such receivables.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	However, these accounts receivable were fully reserved and included in the allowance for doubtful accounts presented above.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	Investments in equipment and leases, net:

1394922_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P94_S2	In addition, the company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P94_S3	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P94_S4	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P94_S5	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P94_S6	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P113_S3	The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or liability of the Company.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P113_S4	Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lenders, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Managing Member knows of no facts or circumstances that would make the Company s contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial transactions between businesses.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	Accordingly, the Company believes that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice, and that any potential liability under the Company s similar commitments is remote.

1394922_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, only the Company s warrants were measured on a recurring basis.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	The Company also recorded non-recurring adjustments to reflect the fair value of an impaired investment security during 2015 and those of impaired off-lease equipment during 2014.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	Amounts at December 31, 2015 and 2014 reflect the fair value of the then existing impaired assets.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Company s valuation policy is determined by members of the Asset Management, Credit and Accounting departments.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P131_S2	Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	of the Company s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P132_S1	Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	Such analysis is performed by asset management and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P133_S2	The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	The fair value adjustments utilized the following methodology:
1394922_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value at the end of the period.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	The valuation of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_16_ITEM8_P135_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the calculated fair value of the Fund s warrant portfolio approximated $327 thousand and $393 thousand, respectively.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	Such valuation is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the Company s Level 3 recurring assets (in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	The investment securities are adjusted for impairment, if any, based upon factors which include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	During 2015, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment of $6 thousand to reduce the cost basis of an impaired investment security.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P139_S1	The reduction in value was based on a market approach technique and uses inputs that reflect qualitative and quantitative information provided by the management of the investee.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P139_S2	Such information indicated reduced growth opportunity and eventual reduction in cash flows and revenues.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P139_S3	During 2014, the Company did not record fair value adjustments on any of its investment securities.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P139_S4	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the aforementioned impaired investment securities were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	The Company did not record any non-recurring fair value adjustments on any equipment during 2015.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P140_S1	By comparison, during 2014, the Company deemed certain off-lease equipment to be impaired and recorded fair value adjustments of $226 thousand to reduce the cost basis of the impaired equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P140_S2	Such fair value adjustments were non-recurring.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P140_S3	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the impaired lease assets were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy as the data sources utilized for the valuation of such assets reflect significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P140_S4	Such valuation utilizes a market approach technique and uses inputs that reflect the sales price of similar assets sold by affiliates and/or information from third party remarketing agents not readily available in the market.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	The following tables present the fair value measurement of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1394922_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following tables summarize the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s recurring and non-recurring fair value calculation categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1394922_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P144_S2	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or has realized in a current market exchange.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P144_S3	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is generally estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market valuation techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.
1394922_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	The following tables present estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

1394922_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1394922_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation.

1394922_16_ITEM10_P13_S0	A Code of Ethics that is applicable to the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Financial Services, LLC, or persons acting in such capacity on behalf of the Company, is included as Exhibit 14.1 to this report.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P0_S0	The registrant has no officers or directors.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P1_S0	Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P1_S1	The amount of such remuneration paid for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in Item 8 of this report under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Financial Statements Related party transactions, at Note 7 thereof, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P2_S0	The Company paid selling commissions in the amount of 9% of Gross Proceeds, as defined, to ATEL Securities Corporation, an affiliate of the Manager.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P3_S0	Through December 31, 2009, $2.7 million of such commissions had either been accrued or paid to ASC.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P3_S1	Of that amount, $2.3 million has been re-allowed to other broker/dealers.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P3_S2	The Company did not incur any additional selling commissions subsequent to December 31, 2009.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Company pays the Manager an Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4% of Operating Revenues, which includes Gross Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P4_S1	The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P4_S2	The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5% of all Company Distributions.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P7_S0	AFS supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees/borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P7_S1	AFS intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P8_S1	While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor s understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P8_S2	The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P9_S0	The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. ( NASAA ) is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P9_S1	NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ).
1394922_16_ITEM11_P9_S2	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P9_S3	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P9_S4	The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund s prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ).
1394922_16_ITEM11_P9_S5	Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund s term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager s Carried Interest, as described below.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P10_S1	To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P10_S2	To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P10_S3	Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P11_S3	[50% .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_16_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P13_S0	With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5% + 5% = 11.5%), and 7.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5% + 1% = 7.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P13_S1	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P14_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P14_S1	If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P14_S2	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P14_S3	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
1394922_16_ITEM11_P15_S0	See Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.
1394922_16_ITEM12_P0_S0	At December 31, 2015, no investor is known to hold beneficially more than 5% of the issued and outstanding Units.

1394922_16_ITEM15_P6_S1	The Board of Directors shall have oversight responsibility over the activities of the Company for purposes of this Code of Ethics.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P7_S0	The Company is proud of the values with which it conducts business.

1394922_16_ITEM15_P7_S2	To this end, this Code of Ethics serves to (1) emphasize the Company s commitment to ethics and compliance with the law; (2) set forth basic standards of ethical and legal behavior; (3) provide reporting mechanisms for known or suspected ethical or legal violations; and (4) help prevent and detect wrongdoing.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P7_S3	This Code of Ethics is intended to augment and supplement the standard of ethics and business conduct expected of all Company employees, and its limitation to Covered Officers is not intended to limit the obligation of all Company employees to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity in all transactions and interactions conducted while in the Company s employ.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P8_S0	Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the course of business of the Company, this Code of Ethics serves only as a rough guide.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P8_S1	Confronted with ethically ambiguous situations, the Covered Officers should remember the Company s commitment to the highest ethical standards and seek independent advice, where necessary, to ensure that all actions they take on behalf of the Company honor this commitment.

1394922_16_ITEM15_P9_S2	They shall not misrepresent facts or engage in illegal, unethical, or anti-competitive practices for personal or professional gain.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	This fundamental standard of honest and ethical conduct extends to the handling of conflicts of interest.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P10_S1	The Covered Officers shall avoid any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company, and any personal activities, investments, or associations that might give rise to such conflicts.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P10_S2	They shall not compete with or use the Company, for personal gain, self-deal, or take advantage of any corporate opportunities.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P10_S3	They shall act on behalf of the Company free from improper influence or the appearance of improper influence on their judgment or performance of duties.

1394922_16_ITEM15_P10_S5	No action may be taken with respect to such transaction or party unless and until the Company s Board of Directors has approved such action.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood, as fully disclosed in the offering documents for the Company, that AFS as managing member of the Company has certain inherent conflicts of interest.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P11_S1	The provisions of the Company s Operating Agreement have been drafted to address the obligations, restrictions and limitations on the power and authority of AFS to manage the Company s affairs, including restrictions prohibiting or limiting the terms of any transactions in which conflicts of interest may arise.

1394922_16_ITEM15_P13_S1	The Covered Officers shall provide thorough and accurate financial and accounting data for inclusion in such disclosures.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P13_S2	The Covered Officers shall not knowingly conceal or falsify information, misrepresent material facts, or omit material facts necessary to avoid misleading the Company s independent public auditors or investors.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	In conducting the business of the Company, the Covered Officers shall comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations at all levels of government in the United States and in any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which the Company does business, as well as applicable rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations of which the Company is a member.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	If the Covered Officer is unsure whether a particular action would violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation, he or she should seek the advice of inside counsel (if available), and, where necessary, outside counsel before undertaking it.
1394922_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	The Covered Officers will promptly bring to the attention of the Company s General Counsel or the Board of Directors any information concerning a material violation of any of the laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company and the operation of its businesses, by the Company or any agent thereof, or of violation of this Code of Ethics.

1394922_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 ( Date of Inception ) for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Company s Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, LLC ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability company.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial Services, LLC ( AFS or Managing Member or Manager ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P0_S3	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	As of January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2016, cumulative gross contributions, less rescissions and repurchases (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs, as applicable), totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	As of the same date, 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company s principal objectives have been to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that will (i) preserve, protect and return the Company s invested capital; (ii) generate regular cash distributions to Unitholders, with any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the Reinvestment Period (ending six calendar years after the completion of the Company s public offering of Units) and (iii) provide additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets has been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company is governed by the ATEL 12, LLC amended and restated Limited Liability Company Operating agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Managing Member and/or its affiliates receives compensation for services rendered and reimbursements for costs incurred on behalf of the Company (See Note 7, Related party transactions, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).
1394922_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company is required to maintain reasonable cash reserves for working capital, the repurchase of Units and contingencies.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The repurchase of Units is solely at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	On January 1, 2016, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Prior thereto, the Company was in its acquisition phase and was making distributions on a monthly and quarterly basis.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	During the liquidation phase, periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company had acquired various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and made loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Company s primary investment objective was to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as the core operating equipment used by companies in the manufacturing, mining and transportation industries.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	A portion of the portfolio would include some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	The Company sought investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Company purchased equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease was entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Through December 31, 2016, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of $28.6 million.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Company had also funded investments in notes receivable totaling $5.4 million through December 31, 2016.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Company s objective was to have at least 60% of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	High quality corporate credits were lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or were public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio would include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, would consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, would consist of real estate investments.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P12_S5	The Company s objective was to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments as of the final commitment of net offering proceeds; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30,000,000); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	The primary geographic region in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities is North America.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	All of the Company s current operating revenues and long-lived assets relate to customers domiciled in United States.
1394922_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.

1394922_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) updated rules for the presentation of account statement values relative to pricing of Direct Placement Program ( DPP ) shares.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	Rule 2340, Customer Account Statements, and FINRA rule 2310, which address a FINRA member firm s participation in a public offering of a DPP.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	In summary, the amendments require a FINRA member firm to include in the account statements for customers holding DPP securities a per share value for the DPP.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P1_S3	This per share value must be prepared by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P1_S4	The results of this valuation must be disclosed in the issuer s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P1_S5	A valuation in compliance with the Notice must be undertaken and published on at least an annual basis.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	The effective date of the Notice was April 11, 2016.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	Broker dealers are required to provide a per share estimated value on the customer account statements for each non-listed DPP security held by their customers.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	Such estimated value must have been developed in a manner reasonably designed to provide a reliable value.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Two valuation methodologies have been defined by FINRA, which by such designation are presumed to be reliable.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	The amendments to NASD Rule 2340(c)(1)(A) require net investment to be based on the amount available for investment percentage disclosed in the Estimated Use of Proceeds section of the issuer s offering prospectus.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	In essence, such value is equal to the offering price less selling commissions, other offering and organization expenses, and capital reserves.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P5_S2	This method may be used for up to 150 days following the second anniversary of a Fund breaking escrow.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	As amended, Rule NASD 2340(c)(1)(B) requires that the per share estimated value disclosed in an issuer s most recent periodic or current report be based upon an appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the program by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service, in conformity with standard industry valuation practice as it relates to both the aforementioned assets and liabilities.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P6_S1	No later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the issuer s break of escrow for its minimum offering, this methodology must be used to establish the required estimated values.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P7_S0	The per Unit valuation estimate for ATEL 12, LLC has been conducted, and the results disclosed herein, in compliance with the mandates of the Notice.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P8_S0	For ATEL 12, LLC , its estimated value per Unit reflects the Manager s estimate of current portfolio valuation of all assets and liabilities of the Fund, calculated on a per Unit basis, and as such, does not represent a market value for the Units and may not accurately reflect the value of the Fund Units to the Unit holders if held over time to Fund maturity.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P9_S0	In connection with any estimate of per Unit value, Unit holders and all parties are reminded that no public market for the Units exists.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P9_S1	Additionally, in order to preserve the Fund s pass-through status for federal income tax purposes, the Fund will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P9_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P10_S0	The estimate of per Unit value does not take into account any extraordinary potential future business activity of the Fund; rather the valuation represents a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P10_S1	In addition, the Fund does not include any analysis of the distributions that have already been paid by the Fund, nor the anticipated returns to Unit holder over the full course of the Fund life cycle, which will be dependent on many factors.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P11_S0	The estimated value per Unit reported in this Form 10-K has been calculated using the Appraised Value Methodology described above under Methodologies above, as of December 31, 2016.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P12_S0	ATEL 12, LLC , will satisfy the disclosure requirements for providing estimated per Unit values pursuant to the Notice as follows:
1394922_17_ITEM5_P13_S0	For these disclosures, subsequent to the Fund's initial compliance with FINRA 15-02, annual disclosures of estimated per Unit values, through the termination of the Fund; will be accomplished and included on an annual basis in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available to the public.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P14_S0	Fund Assets and Liabilities (other than as specifically identified below) : The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as current assets and liabilities are assumed to equal their reported GAAP balances as an appropriate approximation of their fair values.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P14_S1	Debt (interest bearing) is assumed to equal the fair values of the debt as disclosed in the footnotes of the 10-K.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P15_S0	Investments in Leases (net of fees and expenses) : The estimated values for Investments in Leases are based on calculating the present value of the projected future cash flows.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P15_S1	Projected future cash flows include both the remaining contractual lease payments, plus assumptions on lease renewals and sale value of the residuals.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P15_S2	Projected future cash flows are net of projected future fees and expenses including:
1394922_17_ITEM5_P16_S0	Projected future cash flows have been discounted back to present value at discount rates based on like-term U.S. Treasury yields (as of the valuation date) plus a 300 basis point spread, to account for the credit risk differentials between the instrument being valued and U.S. Treasury security yields.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P17_S0	Residual values assumptions used in the cash flow projections are as follows:
1394922_17_ITEM5_P18_S0	For On-Lease and Month-to-Month Lease : Considers realized residual as a percent of book residual of 162.8%, based on ATEL s historical track record as of December 31, 2016.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P18_S1	In addition, an annual inflation rate of 2.50% has been assumed.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P19_S0	For Off-Lease : A fair value of off-lease equipment is based on estimates from ATEL s seasoned Asset Management Group.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P20_S0	Special Situation Leases : The valuation of certain leases has been performed outside of the above noted protocol based upon specific lease assumptions different than the macro assumptions above, due to the specific situations of those leases.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P21_S0	Investments in Notes Receivable : The estimated values for Investments in Notes Receivable are assumed to approximate the reported GAAP balances.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P22_S0	Investments in Marketable Securities : The estimated values for Marketable Securities have been based on the estimated net book value as of the valuation date (with impairment adjustments), plus any unrealized gain on equity.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P22_S1	The unrealized gain on equity is based on either: a) the most recent round of financing, b) the most recent 409A valuation provided by the underlying companies of the warrants, or c) the Manager s estimate of the company valuations based on all available information, including company financials, company valuation reports, public press releases, and other sources.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P23_S0	The estimated values for Warrants Outstanding considers the reported GAAP balances to be an appropriate approximation of their fair values.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P24_S0	Syndication Costs : Syndication costs for the Fund have been added to the value, estimated based on 15% of gross equity raised, and are assumed to be amortized over the expected 12-year life of the Fund.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P24_S1	The remaining unamortized portion has been added to the Fund s balance sheet as an asset.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P25_S0	Accrued distributions : Accrued distributions, which are payable to the Unit holders have been removed from the balance sheet liability section because they are not a liability to a third party.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P26_S0	The Manager s estimated per Unit value of ATEL 12, LLC at December 31, 2016 as determined, and derived under the guidelines of the Appraised Value Methodology, and pursuant to the above specific enumerated component valuation methodologies and calculations, equals $2.06.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P26_S1	An independent national public accounting firm with valuation expertise was retained to examine, attest and confirm ATEL 12, LLC s per Unit valuation and its component methodologies and calculation as it relates to compliance with the regulatory mandate defined in the Notice.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P26_S2	In this regard, they examined the components of the valuation methodologies and determined them to be reasonable and within industry standards.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P26_S3	Other component attributes, including the bases and related key assumptions of the calculation were tested for their completeness, underlying documentation support and mathematical accuracy.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P26_S4	Upon completion of their efforts, their attestation report confirmed that the per unit valuation of ATEL 12, LLC, and the related notes, in all material respects, was based upon industry practice as described in the Manager s valuation approach.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P27_S0	The foregoing Fund per Unit valuation has been performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated value per Unit in accordance with a regulatory mandate, in order to provide the broker dealer and custodian community with a valuation on a reasonable and attested basis for use in assigning an estimation of a Unit holder s account value.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P27_S1	Any report or disclosure of such estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by statements that the value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Unit holder were to seek to sell the Units, and that the Fund intends to liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and over the Fund s term.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P27_S2	Further, each statement of the Fund s estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by a disclosure that there can be no assurance as to (1) when the Fund will be fully liquidated, (2) the amount the Fund may actually receive if and when the Fund seeks to liquidate its assets, (3) the amount of lease or loan payments the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, (4) the amount of asset disposition proceeds the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, and (5) the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unit holders over the course of the remaining term.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P28_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P28_S1	The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P28_S2	Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2016.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P29_S0	Cash distributions were paid by the Fund to Unitholders of record as of November 30, 2016, and paid through December 31, 2016.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P30_S0	Distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P30_S1	Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P30_S2	The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P30_S3	See the discussion in the ATEL 12, LLC Prospectus dated September 26, 2007 ( Prospectus ) under Income, Losses and Distributions Reinvestment.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P30_S4	Accordingly, the amount of cash flow from Fund investments distributed to Unitholders will not be available for reinvestment in additional portfolio assets.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P31_S0	Cash distributions were based on current and anticipated gross revenues from the leases and loans acquired.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P31_S1	During the Fund s acquisition and operating stages, the Fund may incur short term borrowing to fund regular distributions of such gross revenues to be generated by newly acquired transactions during their respective initial fixed terms.
1394922_17_ITEM5_P31_S2	As such, all Fund periodic cash distributions made during these stages have been, and are expected in the future to be, based on the Fund s actual and anticipated gross revenues to be generated from the binding initial terms of the leases and loans acquired.

1394922_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 ( Date of Inception ) for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.

1394922_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009 with a total of 2,999,482 Units subscribed, representing contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, approximating $29.9 million.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2016, 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2009, the Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.

1394922_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ended December 31, 2015, the Company reinvested cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.

1394922_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	However, pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities on January 1, 2016.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high during the funding period and throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	All of the Company s equipment on lease was purchased in the years 2008 through 2013.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 98% and 100% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member and/or affiliates are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company had net income of $583 thousand, and $988 thousand, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The net results for 2016 reflect decreases in both total revenues and total operating expenses when compared to prior year.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Total revenues for 2016 decreased by $1.2 million or 42%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Such decrease was largely due to a $526 thousand, or 24% reduction in lease revenues, mainly the result of run-off and dispositions of lease assets; a $467 thousand, or 129%, unfavorable turn to net loss from net gain of $361 million on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes resulting from a change in mix of and a diminished volume in sale activities in 2016; a 58% lesser gain to $62 thousand reflected as gains realized on sales of securities, mainly attributable to a lower volume of sales activities during 2016; and a 78% decrease interest on notes receivable of $53 thousand largely due to scheduled run-off of the loan portfolio; and was partially offset by a $96 thousand, or 310% increase in other revenue, related to in deferred maintenance fees and other fees charged to certain lessees.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total expenses for 2016 decreased by $760 thousand or 43%, as compared to prior year.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decrease in total expenses was largely a result of a $644 thousand, or 54%, reduction in depreciation expense, mostly the result of run-off and sales of lease assets; a $60 thousand, or 27%, decline in cost reimbursements to the Manager and/or affiliates, directly attributable to a reduced level of fund assets under management; a $37 thousand, or 58% decrease in franchise fees and taxes, which can be attributed to both a diminishing tax base and to the timing of tax payments to various jurisdictions.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company currently believes it has adequate reserves available to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	During 2016 and 2015, the Company s primary sources of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating and direct financing lease contracts, and its investments in notes receivable.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	In addition, the Company realized $220 thousand and $1.5 million of proceeds from sales of lease assets and/or the early termination of notes receivable, in 2016 and 2015 respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Principal payments received on notes receivable were $309 thousand and $401 thousand for the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	During the same comparative years, cash was primarily used to pay distributions and repay debt.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Distributions paid to both members and the Managing Member totaled $2.9 million and $2.9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively; while cash used to repay debt totaled $455 thousand and $873 thousand, respectively.

1394922_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	The notes are secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after December 31, 2016, up until the issuance of the financial statements.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, operating and direct financing lease receivables, notes receivable and accounts receivable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company places the majority of its cash deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts with financial institutions that have no less than $10 billion in assets.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	Such deposits are insured up to $250 thousand.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	The remainder of the Funds cash is temporarily invested in U.S. Treasury denominated instruments.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P22_S4	The concentration of such deposits and temporary cash investments is not deemed to create a significant risk to the Company.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Accounts and notes receivable represent amounts due from lessees or borrowers in various industries, related to equipment on operating and direct financing leases or notes receivable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company depreciates all lease assets, in accordance with guidelines consistent with ASC 840-20-35-3, over the periods of the lease terms contained in each asset s respective lease contract to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease contract.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P25_S4	All lease assets were purchased only concurrent with the execution of a lease commitment by the lessee.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P25_S5	Thus, the original depreciation period corresponds with the term of the original lease.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Once the term of an original lease contract is completed, the subject property is typically sold to the existing user, re-leased to the existing user, or, when off-lease, is held for sale.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	Assets which are re-leased continue to be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Assets classified as held-for-sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount, or the fair value less cost to sell (ASC 360-10-35-43).
1394922_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company does not use the equipment held in its portfolio, but holds it solely for lease and ultimate sale.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	In the course of marketing equipment that has come off-lease, management may determine at some point that re-leasing the assets may provide a superior return for investors and would then execute another lease.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	Upon entering into a new lease contract, management will estimate the residual value once again and resume depreciation.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	All lease assets, including off-lease assets, are subject to the Company s quarterly impairment analysis, as described below.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P31_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P31_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P35_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P35_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P37_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P37_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P38_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P38_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P38_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related notes may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P39_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P39_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual lease term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P40_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease assets and notes receivable, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P40_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection and acquisition of equipment which are reimbursable to the Managing Member under the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	As the costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	In addition, the company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P42_S4	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P42_S5	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P42_S6	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company had $272 thousand and $300 thousand of purchased securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Based upon the Company s review of its portfolio, no fair value adjustment was deemed necessary for 2016 and 2015.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are reflected at an estimated fair value on the balance sheet as determined by the Managing Member.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company recorded unrealized losses of $168 thousand and $66 thousand on fair value adjustment of its warrants during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	The unrealized losses recorded during 2016 reduced the estimated fair value of the Company s portfolio of warrants to $159 thousand at December 31, 2016 from $327 thousand at December 31, 2015.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	The liability is recorded when prepayments are received and recognized as operating lease revenue over the period to which the prepayments relate using a straight-line method.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	Pursuant to the provisions of Section 701 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is not subject to federal income taxes.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided current franchise income taxes for only those states which levy income taxes on partnerships.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	To achieve this objective, the amendments in this Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	The amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P112_S4	Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lender, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P123_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P127_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, only the Company s warrants were measured on a recurring basis.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	During 2016, the Company had no non-recurring adjustments to reduce the cost basis of certain assets deemed impaired.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P128_S2	During 2015, the Company recorded non-recurring adjustments to reduce the cost basis of certain investment in securities deemed impaired in 2015.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	The Company s valuation policy is determined by members of the Asset Management, Credit and Accounting departments.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P129_S1	Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P129_S2	Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P129_S3	These techniques are significantly affected by certain of the Company s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P129_S4	Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P130_S1	Such analysis is performed by asset management and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P130_S2	The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	Such fair value adjustments utilized the following methodology:
1394922_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value at the end of the period.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	The valuation of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_17_ITEM8_P132_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the calculated fair value of the Fund s warrant portfolio approximated $159 thousand and $327 thousand, respectively.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	Such valuations are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the Company s Level 3 recurring assets (in thousands):

1394922_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	The investment securities are adjusted for impairment, if any, based upon factors which include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	During 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded no fair value adjustments to reduce the cost basis of investment securities.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	A majority of the reduction in value was based on a market approach technique and uses inputs that reflect qualitative and quantitative information provided by the management of the investee, which indicated reduced growth opportunity and eventual reduction in cash flows and revenues.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of impaired assets is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

1394922_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P142_S2	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is generally estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market valuation techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse and long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.
1394922_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	The following tables present estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

1394922_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1394922_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1394922_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation.
1394922_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1394922_17_ITEM10_P14_S0	A Code of Ethics that is applicable to the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Financial Services, LLC, or persons acting in such capacity on behalf of the Company, is included as Exhibit 14.1 to this report.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P0_S0	The registrant has no officers or directors.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P1_S0	Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P1_S1	The amount of such remuneration paid for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is set forth in Item 8 of this report under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Financial Statements Related party transactions, at Note 7 thereof, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P2_S0	The Company pays the Manager an annual Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4% of Gross Operating Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P2_S1	The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P2_S2	The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P3_S0	The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Manager supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P4_S1	The Manager intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5% of all Company Distributions.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P6_S1	While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor s understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P6_S2	The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P7_S0	The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. ( NASAA ) is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P8_S0	standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ).
1394922_17_ITEM11_P9_S0	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P9_S1	Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P9_S2	The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund s prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ).
1394922_17_ITEM11_P9_S3	Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interest payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund s term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager s Carried Interest, as described below.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P10_S1	To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P10_S2	To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P10_S3	Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P11_S3	[50% .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_17_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P13_S0	With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5% + 5% = 11.5%), and 7.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5% + 1% = 7.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P13_S1	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P14_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P15_S0	Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P15_S1	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P15_S2	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
1394922_17_ITEM11_P16_S0	See Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.

1394922_18_ITEM1_P10_S3	The Company sought investments in equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Company purchased equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease was entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Through December 31, 2017, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of $28.6 million.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Company had also funded investments in notes receivable totaling $5.4 million through December 31, 2017.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Company s objective was to have at least 60% of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	High quality corporate credits were lessees or guarantors who have a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or were public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	The remaining 40% of the initial investment portfolio would include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	Included in this 40% of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	No more than 20% of the initial portfolio, by cost, would consist of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20% of the portfolio, by cost, would consist of real estate investments.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P12_S5	The Company s objective was to invest approximately 25% of its capital in assets that involve green technologies or applications as discussed above.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	The equipment financing industry is highly competitive.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of investments as of the final commitment of net offering proceeds; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity investment in equipment or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20% of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or $30,000,000); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	The primary geographic region in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities is North America.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	All of the Company s current operating revenues and long-lived assets relate to customers domiciled in United States.
1394922_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	The business of the Company is not seasonal.

1394922_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of conducting business, there may be certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against the Company.
1394922_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1394922_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	No material legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company or against any of its assets.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) updated rules for the presentation of account statement values relative to pricing of Direct Placement Program ( DPP ) shares.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	Rule 2340, Customer Account Statements, and FINRA rule 2310, which address a FINRA member firm s participation in a public offering of a DPP.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	In summary, the amendments require a FINRA member firm to include in the account statements for customers holding DPP securities a per share value for the DPP.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P1_S3	This per share value must be prepared by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P1_S4	The results of this valuation must be disclosed in the issuer s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P1_S5	A valuation in compliance with the Notice must be undertaken and published on at least an annual basis.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	The effective date of the Notice was April 11, 2016.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	Broker dealers are required to provide a per share estimated value on the customer account statements for each non-listed DPP security held by their customers.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	Such estimated value must have been developed in a manner reasonably designed to provide a reliable value.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Two valuation methodologies have been defined by FINRA, which by such designation are presumed to be reliable.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The amendments to NASD Rule 2340(c)(1)(A) require net investment to be based on the amount available for investment percentage disclosed in the Estimated Use of Proceeds section of the issuer s offering prospectus.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P5_S1	In essence, such value is equal to the offering price less selling commissions, other offering and organization expenses, and capital reserves.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P5_S2	This method may be used for up to 150 days following the second anniversary of a Fund breaking escrow.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	As amended, Rule NASD 2340(c)(1)(B) requires that the per share estimated value disclosed in an issuer s most recent periodic or current report be based upon an appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the program by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service, in conformity with standard industry valuation practice as it relates to both the aforementioned assets and liabilities.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P6_S1	No later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the issuer s break of escrow for its minimum offering, this methodology must be used to establish the required estimated values.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	The per Unit valuation estimate for ATEL 12, LLC has been conducted, and the results disclosed herein, in compliance with the mandates of the Notice.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P8_S0	For ATEL 12, LLC , its estimated value per Unit reflects the Manager s estimate of current portfolio valuation of all assets and liabilities of the Fund, calculated on a per Unit basis, and as such, does not represent a market value for the Units and may not accurately reflect the value of the Fund Units to the Unit holders if held over time to Fund maturity.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P9_S0	In connection with any estimate of per Unit value, Unit holders and all parties are reminded that no public market for the Units exists.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P9_S1	Additionally, in order to preserve the Fund s pass-through status for federal income tax purposes, the Fund will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P9_S2	In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P10_S0	The estimate of per Unit value does not take into account any extraordinary potential future business activity of the Fund; rather the valuation represents a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P10_S1	In addition, the Fund does not include any analysis of the distributions that have already been paid by the Fund, nor the anticipated returns to Unit holder over the full course of the Fund life cycle, which will be dependent on many factors.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P11_S0	The estimated value per Unit reported in this Form 10-K has been calculated using the Appraised Value Methodology described above under Methodologies above, as of December 31, 2017.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P12_S0	ATEL 12, LLC , will satisfy the disclosure requirements for providing estimated per Unit values pursuant to the Notice as follows:
1394922_18_ITEM5_P13_S0	For these disclosures, subsequent to the Fund's initial compliance with FINRA 15-02, annual disclosures of estimated per Unit values, through the termination of the Fund; will be accomplished and included on an annual basis in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available to the public.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P14_S0	Fund Assets and Liabilities (other than as specifically identified below) : The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as current assets and liabilities are assumed to equal their reported GAAP balances as an appropriate approximation of their fair values.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P14_S1	Debt (interest bearing) is assumed to equal the fair values of the debt as disclosed in the footnotes of the financial statements.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P15_S0	Investments in Leases (net of fees and expenses) : The estimated values for Investments in Leases are based on calculating the present value of the projected future cash flows.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P15_S1	Projected future cash flows include both the remaining contractual lease payments, plus assumptions on lease renewals and sale value of the residuals.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P15_S2	Projected future cash flows are net of projected future fees and expenses including:
1394922_18_ITEM5_P16_S0	Projected future cash flows have been discounted back to present value at discount rates based on like-term U.S. Treasury yields (as of the valuation date) plus a 400 basis point spread, to account for the credit risk differentials between the instrument being valued and U.S. Treasury security yields.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P17_S0	Residual values assumptions used in the cash flow projections are as follows:
1394922_18_ITEM5_P18_S0	For On-Lease and Month-to-Month Lease : Considers realized residual as a percent of book residual of 165.9%, based on ATEL s historical track record as of December 31, 2017.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P19_S0	For Off-Lease : A fair value of off-lease equipment is based on estimates from ATEL s seasoned Asset Management Group.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P20_S0	Special Situation Leases : The valuation of certain leases has been performed outside of the above noted protocol based upon specific lease assumptions different than the macro assumptions above, due to the specific situations of those leases.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P21_S0	Investments in Notes Receivable : The estimated values for Investments in Notes Receivable are assumed to approximate the reported GAAP balances.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P22_S0	Investments in Securities : The estimated values for Investments in Securities have been based on the estimated net book value as of the valuation date (with impairment adjustments), plus any unrealized gain on equity.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P22_S1	The unrealized gain on equity is based on either: a) the most recent round of financing, b) the most recent 409A valuation provided by the underlying companies of the warrants, or c) the Manager s estimate of the company valuations based on all available information, including company financials, company valuation reports, public press releases, and other sources.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P23_S0	The estimated values for Warrants Outstanding considers the reported GAAP balances to be an appropriate approximation of their fair values.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P24_S0	Syndication Costs : Syndication costs for the Fund have been added to the value, estimated based on 15% of gross equity raised, and are assumed to be amortized over the expected 12-year life of the Fund.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P24_S1	The remaining unamortized portion has been added to the Fund s balance sheet as an asset.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P25_S0	Accrued distributions : Accrued distributions, which are payable to the Unit holders have been removed from the balance sheet liability section because they are not a liability to a third party.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P26_S0	The Manager s estimated per Unit value of ATEL 12, LLC at December 31, 2017 as determined, and derived under the guidelines of the Appraised Value Methodology, and pursuant to the above specific enumerated component valuation methodologies and calculations, equals $1.63.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P26_S1	An independent national public accounting firm with valuation expertise was retained to examine, attest and confirm ATEL 12, LLC s per Unit valuation and its component methodologies and calculation as it relates to compliance with the regulatory mandate defined in the Notice.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P26_S2	In this regard, they examined the components of the valuation methodologies and determined them to be reasonable and within industry standards.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P26_S3	Other component attributes, including the bases and related key assumptions of the calculation were tested for their completeness, underlying documentation support and mathematical accuracy.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P26_S4	Upon completion of their efforts, their attestation report confirmed that the per unit valuation of ATEL 12, LLC, and the related notes, in all material respects, was based upon industry practice as described in the Manager s valuation approach.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P27_S0	The foregoing Fund per Unit valuation has been performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated value per Unit in accordance with a regulatory mandate, in order to provide the broker dealer and custodian community with a valuation on a reasonable and attested basis for use in assigning an estimation of a Unit holder s account value.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P27_S1	Any report or disclosure of such estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by statements that the value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Unit holder were to seek to sell the Units, and that the Fund intends to liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and over the Fund s term.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P27_S2	Further, each statement of the Fund s estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by a disclosure that there can be no assurance as to (1) when the Fund will be fully liquidated, (2) the amount the Fund may actually receive if and when the Fund seeks to liquidate its assets, (3) the amount of lease or loan payments the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, (4) the amount of asset disposition proceeds the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, and (5) the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unit holders over the course of the remaining term.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P28_S0	The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P28_S1	The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of February 2008.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P28_S2	Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2017.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P29_S0	Cash distributions were paid by the Fund to Unitholders of record as of November 30, 2017, and paid through December 31, 2017.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P30_S0	Distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P30_S1	Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P30_S2	The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P30_S3	See the discussion in the ATEL 12, LLC Prospectus dated September 26, 2007 ( Prospectus ) under Income, Losses and Distributions Reinvestment.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P30_S4	Accordingly, the amount of cash flow from Fund investments distributed to Unitholders will not be available for reinvestment in additional portfolio assets.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P31_S0	Cash distributions were based on current and anticipated gross revenues from the leases and loans acquired.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P31_S1	During the Fund s acquisition and operating stages, the Fund may incur short term borrowing to fund regular distributions of such gross revenues to be generated by newly acquired transactions during their respective initial fixed terms.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P31_S2	As such, all Fund periodic cash distributions made during these stages have been, and are expected in the future to be, based on the Fund s actual and anticipated gross revenues to be generated from the binding initial terms of the leases and loans acquired.
1394922_18_ITEM5_P32_S0	The following table presents summarized information regarding distributions to other members:
1394922_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	A smaller reporting company is not required to present selected financial data in accordance with item 301(c) of Regulation S-K.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Statements contained in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 ( Date of Inception ) for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	As of January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009 with a total of 2,999,482 Units subscribed, representing contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, approximating $29.9 million.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2017, 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2009, the Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	amounts required to be distributed to the members and/or utilized its credit facilities to acquire additional equipment.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ended December 31, 2015, the Company reinvested cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement ( Operating Agreement ), as amended.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	However, pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities on January 1, 2016.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100% utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high during the funding period and throughout the reinvestment stage.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 120 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	All of the Company s equipment on lease was purchased in the years 2008 through 2013.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 99% and 98% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member and/or affiliates are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company had net loss of $192 thousand and net income of $583 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The net results for 2017 reflect a decrease in total revenue and an increase in total operating expenses when compared to the prior year.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Total revenues for 2017 declined by $181 thousand, or 11%, as compared to the prior year period.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Such decrease was largely due to a $349 thousand, or 21%, reduction in operating lease revenues, mainly the result of dispositions of lease assets; a $114 thousand, or 90%, decrease in other revenue related to deferred maintenance fees previously collected on certain returned equipment in the prior period; and a $15 thousand decrease in interest on notes receivable, offset, in part, by a $158 thousand, or 94%, favorable change on the fair value adjustment for warrants; a $128 thousand, or 121%, favorable change on the gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes receivable; and a $13 thousand, or 21%, increase in gain on sales of investment in securities.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total expenses for 2017 increased by $594 thousand, or 58%, as compared to the prior year period.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Such increase in expenses was primarily the result of a $281 thousand increase in impairment losses recognized on equipment; a $219 thousand increase in impairment losses on investment in securities during the current year period; a $37 thousand, or 88%, increase in outside services, indicative of additional efforts required to comply with certain regulatory requirements; a $32 thousand increase in an adjustment for provision for credit losses, due to increased delinquent accounts; a $20 thousand or 16%, increase in professional fees related to a year over year difference in timing and related billings for professional audit and tax services; an $18 thousand, or 3%, increase in depreciation expense, mainly the result of a lease contract renewal and a reduction in residual value on certain equipment; offset in part, by an $11 thousand, or 23%, decrease in asset management fees to the managing member, related to lower revenue from leases.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $479 thousand and $1.0 million, respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company currently believes it has adequate reserves available to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):
1394922_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	During 2017 and 2016, the Company s primary sources of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating and direct financing lease contracts, and its investments in notes receivable.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	In addition, the Company realized $229 thousand and $319 thousand of proceeds from sales or dispositions of investment in securities and sales of lease assets and/or the early termination of notes receivable, in 2017 and 2016 respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Principal payments received on notes receivable were $0 and $309 thousand for the years ended 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	During the same comparative years, cash was primarily used to pay distributions and repay debt.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Distributions paid to both other members and the Managing Member totaled $1.1 million and $2.9 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively; while cash used to repay non-recourse debt totaled $463 thousand and $455 thousand, respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling $103 thousand and $566 thousand, respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The notes are secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	For detailed information on the Company s debt obligations, see Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

1394922_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2017.
1394922_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Management of the Company s Managing Member.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P3_S3	As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P3_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	ATEL 12, LLC (the Company or the Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 ( Date of Inception ) for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability company.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P10_S2	Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial Services, LLC ( AFS or Managing Member or Manager ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P10_S3	The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company conducted a public offering of 20,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units ( Units ), at a price of $10 per Unit.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	As of January 24, 2008, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing $1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the second quarter of 2008.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least $7.5 million.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	Total contributions to the Fund exceeded $7.5 million on July 15, 2008, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P13_S2	The offering was terminated on September 25, 2009.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2017, cumulative gross contributions, less rescissions and repurchases (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs, as applicable), totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	As of the same date, 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company s principal objectives have been to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that will (i) preserve, protect and return the Company s invested capital; (ii) generate regular cash distributions to Unitholders, with any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the Reinvestment Period (ending six calendar years after the completion of the Company s public offering of Units) and (iii) provide additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets has been sold or otherwise disposed.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company is governed by the ATEL 12, LLC amended and restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the Operating Agreement ).
1394922_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Managing Member and/or its affiliates receives compensation for services rendered and reimbursements for costs incurred on behalf of the Company (See Note 6, Related party transactions).
1394922_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company is required to maintain reasonable cash reserves for working capital, the repurchase of Units and contingencies.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	The repurchase of Units is solely at the discretion of the Managing Member.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related statements of operations, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	Certain prior year amounts may have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	These reclassifications had no significant effect on the reported financial position or results from operations.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after December 31, 2017, up until the issuance of the financial statements.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	No events were noted which would require additional disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements, and adjustments thereto.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and cash equivalent investments such as U.S. Treasury instruments with original and/or purchased maturities of ninety days or less.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Actual results could differ from the estimates.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and for determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, operating and direct financing lease receivables, notes receivable and accounts receivable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company places the majority of its cash deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts with financial institutions that have no less than $10 billion in assets.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Such deposits are insured up to $250 thousand.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P26_S3	The remainder of the Funds cash is temporarily invested in U.S. Treasury denominated instruments.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P26_S4	The concentration of such deposits and temporary cash investments is not deemed to create a significant risk to the Company.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Accounts and notes receivable represent amounts due from lessees or borrowers in various industries, related to equipment on operating and direct financing leases or notes receivable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Equipment on operating leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Equipment subject to operating leases is stated at cost.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line method over the terms of the related leases to the equipment s estimated residual values.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	Off-lease equipment is generally not subject to depreciation.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P29_S3	The Company depreciates all lease assets, in accordance with guidelines consistent with ASC 840-20-35-3, over the periods of the lease terms contained in each asset s respective lease contract to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease contract.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P29_S4	All lease assets were purchased only concurrent with the execution of a lease commitment by the lessee.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P29_S5	Thus, the original depreciation period corresponds with the term of the original lease.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Once the term of an original lease contract is completed, the subject property is typically sold to the existing user, re-leased to the existing user, or, when off-lease, is held for sale.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Assets which are re-leased continue to be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Assets classified as held-for-sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount, or the fair value less cost to sell.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company does not use the equipment held in its portfolio, but holds it solely for lease and ultimate sale.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	In the course of marketing equipment that has come off-lease, management may determine at some point that re-leasing the assets may provide a superior return for investors and would then execute another lease.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	Upon entering into a new lease contract, management will estimate the residual value once again and resume depreciation.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	All lease assets, including off-lease assets, are subject to the Company s quarterly impairment analysis, as described below.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	Maintenance costs associated with the Fund s portfolio of leased assets are expensed as incurred.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	Major additions and betterments are capitalized.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	The initial lease terms will vary as to the type of equipment subject to the leases, the needs of the lessees and the terms to be negotiated, but initial leases are generally on terms from 36 to 120 months.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	The difference between rent received and rental revenue recognized is recorded as unearned operating lease income on the balance sheet.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Operating leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Additionally, management considers the equipment underlying the lease contracts for impairment and periodically reviews the credit worthiness of all operating lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related operating leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P35_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P35_S4	Until such time, revenues are recognized on a cash basis.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Direct financing leases and related revenue recognition:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Income from direct financing lease transactions is reported using the financing method of accounting, in which the Company s investment in the leased property is reported as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through future rentals.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	The interest income portion of each rental payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net receivable outstanding.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Allowances for losses on direct financing leases are typically established based on historical charge-off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified lessees and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	Direct financing leases are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Direct financing leases are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) and deemed impaired when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all direct finance lessees with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related direct financing leases may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P39_S3	Leases placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid lease payments is probable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P39_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Notes receivable, unearned interest income and related revenue recognition:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company records all future payments of principal and interest on notes as notes receivable, which are then offset by the amount of any related unearned interest income.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	For financial statement purposes, the Company reports only the net amount of principal due on the balance sheet.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	The unearned interest is recognized over the term of the note and the income portion of each note payment is calculated so as to generate a constant rate of return on the net balance outstanding.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	Any fees or costs related to notes receivable are recorded as part of the net investment in notes receivable and amortized over the term of the loan.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Allowances for losses on notes receivable are typically established based on historical charge off and collection experience and the collectability of specifically identified borrowers and billed and unbilled receivables.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P42_S3	If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P42_S4	This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P42_S5	Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with note payments outstanding less than 90 days.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Based upon management s judgment, the related notes may be placed on non-accrual status.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	Notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P43_S4	Until such time, all payments received are applied only against outstanding principal balances.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company capitalizes initial direct costs ( IDC ) associated with the origination and funding of lease assets and investments in notes receivable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	IDC includes both internal costs (e.g., the costs of employees activities in connection with successful lease and loan originations) and external broker fees incurred with such originations.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	The costs are amortized on a lease by lease (or note by note) basis based on actual lease term using a straight-line method for operating leases and the effective interest rate method for direct financing leases and notes receivable.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	Upon disposal of the underlying lease assets and notes receivable, both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P44_S4	Costs related to leases or notes receivable that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as acquisition expense.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection and acquisition of equipment which are reimbursable to the Managing Member under the terms of the Operating Agreement.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	As the costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	In addition, the Company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than the net book value.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	ASU 2016-15 addresses specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P65_S3	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	To achieve this objective, the amendments in this Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	The amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P68_S4	Management is currently evaluating the standard and expects the Update may potentially result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses given the change to estimated losses over the contractual life adjusted for expected prepayments.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ).

1394922_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	Similar to the previous guidance, lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P71_S3	Lessors in operating leases will continue to recognize the underlying asset and recognize income on a straight-line basis.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Lessors determine whether a lease is a sale of the underlying asset based on whether the lessee effectively obtains control of the underlying assets.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the financial statements and its operational and related disclosure requirements, including the impact on the Company s current lease portfolio from a lessor perspective.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	Given the limited changes to lessor accounting, Management does not expect material changes to recognition or measurement, but the Company is early in the implementation process and will continue to evaluate the impact.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ).
1394922_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The new standard provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	ASU 2016-01, among other things, (i) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, and (v) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P75_S3	ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and in August 2015, issued Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ).
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	ASU 2015-14 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S4	Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S5	The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S6	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P77_S7	Management s evaluation of the impact of such adoption on the financial statements of the Fund indicates that such impact is non-material as the new revenue guideline does not affect revenues from leases and loans, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Concentration of credit risk and major customers:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company leases equipment to lessees and provides debt financing to borrowers in diversified industries.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	Leases and notes receivable are subject to the Managing Member s credit committee review.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	The leases and notes receivable provide for the return of the equipment to the Company upon default.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were concentrations (greater than or equal to 10% as a percentage of total equipment cost) of equipment leased to lessees and/or financed for borrowers in certain industries as follows:

1394922_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	These percentages are not expected to be comparable in future periods due to anticipated changes in the mix of investments and/or lessees as a result of normal business activities.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	Investments in equipment and leases, net:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company recorded $281 thousand and $0 of fair value adjustments for impairment losses on its investments in equipment and leases during 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	In addition, the Company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than the net book value.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted future rents from the existing lease contract, if any.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P87_S3	Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	As a result of these reviews, management determined that a $281 thousand impairment loss on equipment was deemed necessary for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P88_S3	The Company recorded no fair value adjustments for impairment losses on its investments in equipment and leases during 2016.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member or its affiliates are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P102_S2	The Managing Member believes that the costs reimbursed are the lower of (i) actual costs incurred on behalf of the Company or (ii) the amount the Company would be required to pay independent parties for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Managing Member and/or affiliates earned fees and billed for reimbursements, pursuant to the Operating Agreement, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as follows (in thousands):

1394922_18_ITEM8_P104_S4	At December 31, 2017, gross operating lease rentals totaled approximately $109 thousand over the remaining lease terms; and the carrying value of the pledged assets is $657 thousand.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P104_S5	The notes mature at various dates in 2018.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	The debt is secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lender on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P105_S2	The lender has recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P105_S3	The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or liability of the Company.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P105_S4	Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lender, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P105_S5	Accordingly, as there are no financial covenants or ratios imposed on the Company in connection with the non-recourse debt, the Company has determined that there are no material covenants with respect to the non-recourse debt that warrant footnote disclosure.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Managing Member knows of no facts or circumstances that would make the Company s contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial transactions between businesses.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Accordingly, the Company believes that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice, and that any potential liability under the Company s similar commitments is remote.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P109_S2	Should any such indemnification obligation become payable, the Company would separately record and/or disclose such liability in accordance with GAAP.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P115_S1	The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Level 3 Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P119_S1	These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, only the Company s warrants were measured on a recurring basis.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	During 2017 and 2016, the Company had non-recurring adjustments to reduce the cost basis of certain assets deemed impaired.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	These techniques are significantly affected by certain of the Company s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P122_S2	Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	Such analysis is performed by asset management and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	Such fair value adjustments utilized the following methodology:
1394922_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value at the end of the period.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	The valuation of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s).
1394922_18_ITEM8_P125_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the calculated fair value of the Fund s warrant portfolio approximated $149 thousand and $159 thousand, respectively.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the Company s Level 3 recurring assets (in thousands):
1394922_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	The investment securities are adjusted for impairment, if any, based upon factors which include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair values of such impaired equipment are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy as the data sources utilized for the valuation of the assets reflect significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	Such valuation utilizes a market approach technique and uses inputs that reflect the sales price of similar assets sold by affiliates and/or information from third party remarketing agents not readily available in the market.

1394922_18_ITEM8_P136_S2	The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is generally estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market valuation techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	The fair value of the Company s non-recourse and long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1394922_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.

1394922_18_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Proceeds.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50% of the aggregate cost of its equipment.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P11_S2	The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875% of the Gross Proceeds to Investment in Equipment.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P11_S3	[50% .0625%] = 76.875%), and the Fund s minimum Investment in Equipment would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9%.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P12_S1	The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P12_S2	With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 85.875%, the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 4.5% = 9%; 1% + 1% + 4.5% = 6.5%).
1394922_18_ITEM11_P12_S3	At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5% + 5% = 11.5%), and 7.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5% + 1% = 7.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5% of all Distributions thereafter.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P13_S1	The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P14_S0	Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P15_S0	Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P15_S1	The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above.
1394922_18_ITEM11_P15_S2	A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter.
